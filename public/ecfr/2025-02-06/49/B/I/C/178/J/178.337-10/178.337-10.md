# § 178.337-10   Accident damage protection.

(a) All valves, fittings, pressure relief devices, and other accessories to the tank proper shall be protected in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section against such damage as could be caused by collision with other vehicles or objects, jack-knifing and overturning. In addition, pressure relief valves shall be so protected that in the event of overturn of the vehicle onto a hard surface, their opening will not be prevented and their discharge will not be restricted. 


(b) The protective devices or housing must be designed to withstand static loading in any direction equal to twice the weight of the tank and attachments when filled with the lading, using a safety factor of not less than four, based on the ultimate strength of the material to be used, without damage to the fittings protected, and must be made of metal at least 
3/16-inch thick.


(c) *Rear-end tank protection.* Rear-end tank protection devices must: 


(1) Consist of at least one rear bumper designed to protect the cargo tank and all valves, piping and fittings located at the rear of the cargo tank from damage that could result in loss of lading in the event of a rear end collision. The bumper design must transmit the force of the collision directly to the chassis of the vehicle. The rear bumper and its attachments to the chassis must be designed to withstand a load equal to twice the weight of the loaded cargo tank motor vehicle and attachments, using a safety factor of four based on the tensile strength of the materials used, with such load being applied horizontally and parallel to the major axis of the cargo tank. The rear bumper dimensions must also meet the requirements of § 393.86 of this title; or 


(2) Conform to the requirements of § 178.345-8(d).


(d) *Chlorine tanks.* A chlorine tank must be equipped with a protective housing and a manway cover to permit the use of standard emergency kits for controlling leaks in fittings on the dome cover plate. For tanks manufactured on or after October 1, 2009, the housing and manway cover must conform to the Chlorine Institute, Inc., Dwg. 137-5 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).


(e) *Piping and fittings.* Piping and fittings must be grouped in the smallest practicable space and protected from damage as required in this section. 


(f) *Shear section.* A shear section or sacrificial device is required for the valves specified in the following locations: 


(1) A section that will break under strain must be provided adjacent to or outboard of each valve specified in § 178.337-8(a)(3) and (4). 


(2) Each internal self-closing stop valve, excess flow valve, and check valve must be protected by a shear section or other sacrificial device. The sacrificial device must be located in the piping system outboard of the stop valve and within the accident damage protection to prevent any accidental loss of lading. The failure of the sacrificial device must leave the protected lading protection device and its attachment to the cargo tank wall intact and capable of retaining product.
