# ยง 178.345-15   Certification.

(a) At or before the time of delivery, the manufacturer of a cargo tank motor vehicle must provide certification documents to the owner of the cargo tank motor vehicle. The registration numbers of the manufacturer, the Design Certifying Engineer, and the Registered Inspector, as appropriate, must appear on the certificates (see subpart F, part 107 in subchapter A of this chapter).


(b) The manufacturer of a cargo tank motor vehicle made to any of these specifications must provide:


(1) For each design type, a certificate signed by a responsible official of the manufacturer and a Design Certifying Engineer certifying that the cargo tank motor vehicle design meets the applicable specification; and


(2) For each ASME cargo tank, a cargo tank manufacturer's data report as required by Section VIII of the ASME Code (IBR, see ยง 171.7 of this subchapter). For each cargo tank motor vehicle, a certificate signed by a responsible official of the manufacturer and a Registered Inspector certifying that the cargo tank motor vehicle is constructed, tested and completed in conformance with the applicable specification. 


(c) The manufacturer of a variable specification cargo tank motor vehicle must provide:


(1) For each design type, a certificate signed by a responsible official of the manufacturer and a Design Certifying Engineer certifying that the cargo tank motor vehicle design meets the applicable specifications; and


(2) For each variable specification cargo tank motor vehicle, a certificate signed by a responsible official of the manufacturer and a Registered Inspector certifying that the cargo tank motor vehicle is constructed, tested and completed in conformance with the applicable specifications. The certificate must include all the information required and marked on the variable specification plate.


(d) In the case of a cargo tank motor vehicle manufactured in two or more stages, each manufacturer who performs a manufacturing operation on the incomplete vehicle or portion thereof shall provide to the succeeding manufacturer, at or before the time of delivery, a certificate covering the particular operation performed by that manufacturer, including any certificates received from previous manufacturers, Registered Inspectors, and Design Certifying Engineers. Each certificate must indicate the portion of the complete cargo tank motor vehicle represented thereby, such as basic cargo tank fabrication, insulation, jacket, lining, or piping. The final manufacturer shall provide all applicable certificates to the owner.


(e) *Specification shortages.* If a cargo tank is manufactured which does not meet all applicable specification requirements, thereby requiring subsequent manufacturing involving the installation of additional components, parts, appurtenances or accessories, the cargo tank manufacturer may affix the name plate and specification plate, as required by ยง 178.345-14 (b) and (c), without the original date of certification stamped on the specification plate. The manufacturer shall state the specification requirements not complied with on the manufacturer's Certificate of Compliance. When the cargo tank is brought into full compliance with the applicable specification, the Registered Inspector shall stamp the date of compliance on the specification plate. The Registered Inspector shall issue a Certificate of Compliance stating details of the particular operations performed on the cargo tank, and the date and person (manufacturer, carrier, or repair organization) accomplishing the compliance.
