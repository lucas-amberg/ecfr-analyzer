# § 178.345-6   Supports and anchoring.

(a) A cargo tank with a frame not integral to the cargo tank must have the tank secured by restraining devices to eliminate any motion between the tank and frame that may abrade the tank shell due to the stopping, starting, or turning of the cargo tank motor vehicle. The design calculations of the support elements must include the stresses indicated in § 178.345-3(b) and as generated by the loads described in § 178.345-3(c). Such restraining devices must be readily accessible for inspection and maintenance, except that insulation and jacketing are permitted to cover the restraining devices.


(b) A cargo tank designed and constructed so that it constitutes, in whole or in part, the structural member used in lieu of a frame must be supported in such a manner that the resulting stress levels in the cargo tank do not exceed those specified in § 178.345-3(a). The design calculations of the support elements must include the stresses indicated in § 178.345-3(b) and as generated by the loads described in § 178.345-3(c).
