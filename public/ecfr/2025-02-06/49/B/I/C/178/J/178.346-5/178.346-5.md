# § 178.346-5   Pressure and leakage tests.

(a) Each cargo tank must be tested in accordance with § 178.345-13 and this section.


(b) *Pressure test.* Test pressure must be as follows:


(1) Using the hydrostatic test method, the test pressure must be the greater of 5.0 psig or 1.5 times the cargo tank MAWP.


(2) Using the pneumatic test method, the test pressure must be the greater of 5.0 psig or 1.5 times the cargo tank MAWP, and the inspection pressure must be the cargo tank MAWP.


(c) *Leakage test.* A cargo tank used to transport a petroleum distillate fuel that is equipped with vapor recovery equipment may be leakage tested in accordance with 40 CFR 63.425(e). To satisfy the leakage test requirements of this paragraph, the test specified in 40 CFR 63.425(e)(1) must be conducted using air. The hydrostatic test alternative permitted under Appendix A to 40 CFR Part 60 (“Method 27—Determination of Vapor Tightness of Gasoline Delivery Tank Using Pressure-Vacuum Test”) may not be used to satisfy the leakage test requirements of this paragraph. A cargo tank tested in accordance with 40 CFR 63.425(e) may be marked as specified in § 180.415 of this subchapter.
