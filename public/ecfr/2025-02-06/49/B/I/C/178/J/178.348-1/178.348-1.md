(c) The MAWP for each cargo tank designed to be loaded by vacuum must be at least 25 psig internal and 15 psig external.


(d) Each cargo tank having a MAWP greater than 15 psig must be of circular cross-section.


(e) Each cargo tank having a—


(1) MAWP greater than 15 psig must be “constructed and certified in conformance with Section VIII of the ASME Code” (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter); or 


(2) MAWP of 15 psig or less must be “constructed in accordance with Section VIII of the ASME Code,” except as modified herein:
