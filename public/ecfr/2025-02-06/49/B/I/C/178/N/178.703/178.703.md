# § 178.703   Marking of IBCs.

(a) The manufacturer shall:


(1) Mark every IBC in a durable and clearly visible manner. The marking may be applied in a single line or in multiple lines provided the correct sequence is followed with the information required by this section in letters, numerals and symbols of at least 12 mm in height. This minimum marking size applies only to IBCs manufactured after October 1, 2001). The following information is required in the sequence presented:


(i) Except as provided in § 178.503(e)(1)(ii), the United Nations symbol as illustrated in § 178.503(e)(1)(i). For metal IBCs on which the marking is stamped or embossed, the capital letters “UN” may be applied instead of the symbol.


(ii) The code number designating IBC design type according to § 178.702(a). The letter “W” must follow the IBC design type identification code on an IBC when the IBC differs from the requirements in subpart N of this part, or is tested using methods other than those specified in this subpart, and is approved by the Associate Administrator in accordance with the provisions in § 178.801(i).


(iii) A capital letter identifying the performance standard under which the design type has been successfully tested, as follows:


(A) X—for IBCs meeting Packing Group I, II and III tests;


(B) Y—for IBCs meeting Packing Group II and III tests; and


(C) Z—for IBCs meeting only Packing Group III tests.


(iv) The month (designated numerically) and year (last two digits) of manufacture.


(v) The country authorizing the allocation of the mark. The letters ‘USA’ indicate that the IBC is manufactured and marked in the United States in compliance with the provisions of this subchapter.


(vi) The name and address or symbol of the manufacturer or the approval agency certifying compliance with subparts N and O of this part. Symbols, if used, must be registered with the Associate Administrator.


(vii) The stacking test load in kilograms (kg). For IBCs not designed for stacking, the figure “0” must be shown.


(viii) The maximum permissible gross mass in kg.


(2) The following are examples of symbols and required markings:


(i) For a metal IBC containing solids discharged by gravity made from steel:


(ii) For a flexible IBC containing solids discharged by gravity and made from woven plastic with a liner:


(iii) For a rigid plastic IBC containing liquids, made from plastic with structural equipment withstanding the stack load and with a manufacturer's symbol in place of the manufacturer's name and address:


(iv) For a composite IBC containing liquids, with a rigid plastic inner receptacle and an outer steel body and with the symbol of a DOT approved third-party test laboratory:


(b) *Additional marking.* In addition to markings required in paragraph (a) of this section, each IBC must be marked as follows in a place near the markings required in paragraph (a) of this section that is readily accessible for inspection. Where units of measure are used, the metric unit indicated (e.g., 450 L) must also appear.


(1) For each rigid plastic and composite IBC, the following markings must be included:


(i) Rated capacity in L of water at 20 °C (68 °F);


(ii) Tare mass in kilograms;


(iii) Gauge test pressure in kPa;


(iv) Date of last leakproofness test, if applicable (month and year); and


(v) Date of last inspection (month and year).


(2) For each metal IBC, the following markings must be included on a metal corrosion-resistant plate:


(i) Rated capacity in L of water at 20 °C (68 °F);


(ii) Tare mass in kilograms;


(iii) Date of last leakproofness test, if applicable (month and year);


(iv) Date of last inspection (month and year);


(v) Maximum loading/discharge pressure, in kPa, if applicable;


(vi) Body material and its minimum thickness in mm; and


(vii) Serial number assigned by the manufacturer.


(3) Markings required by paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section may be preceded by the narrative description of the marking, e.g. “Tare Mass: * * *” where the “* * *” are replaced with the tare mass in kilograms of the IBC.


(4) For each fiberboard and wooden IBC, the tare mass in kg must be shown.


(5) Each flexible IBC may be marked with a pictogram displaying recommended lifting methods.


(6) For each composite IBC, the inner receptacle must be marked with at least the following information as required by paragraphs (b)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section. Additionally, the marking must be visible while inside of the outer receptacle. If the marking is not visible from the outer receptacle, the marking must be duplicated on the outer receptacle and include an indication that the marking applies to the inner receptacle.


(i) The code number designating the IBC design type, the name and address or symbol of the manufacturer, the date of manufacture and the country authorizing the allocation of the mark as specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The date of manufacture of the inner receptacle may be different from the marked date of manufacture required by § 178.703(a)(1)(iv) or by § 180.352(d)(1)(iv) of this subchapter; and


(ii) When a composite IBC is designed in such a manner that the outer casing is intended to be dismantled for transport when empty (such as, for the return of the IBC for reuse to the original consignor), each of the parts intended to be detached when so dismantled must be marked with the month and year of manufacture and the name or symbol of the manufacturer.


(7) The symbol applicable to an IBC designed for stacking or not designed for stacking, as appropriate, must be marked on all IBCs manufactured, repaired or remanufactured after January 1, 2011 as follows:


(i)


(ii) Display the symbol in a durable and visible manner.


(iii) The symbol must be a square with each side being not less than 100 mm (3.9 inches) by 100 mm (3.9 inches) as measured from the corner printer marks shown on the figures in paragraph (b)(7)(i) of this section. Where dimensions are not specified, all features must be in approximate proportion to those shown.


(A) *Transitional exception.* A marking in conformance with the requirements of this paragraph in effect on December 31, 2014, may continue to be applied to all IBCs manufactured, repaired or remanufactured between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2016.


(B) For domestic transportation, an IBC marked prior to January 1, 2017 and in conformance with the requirements of this paragraph in effect on December 31, 2014, may continue in service until the end of its useful life.


(iv) For IBCs designed for stacking, the maximum permitted stacking load applicable when the IBC is in transportation must be displayed with the symbol. The mass in kilograms (kg) marked above the symbol must not exceed the load imposed during the design test, as indicated by the marking in paragraph (a)(1)(vii) of this section, divided by 1.8. The letters and numbers indicating the mass must be at least 12 mm (0.48 inches).
