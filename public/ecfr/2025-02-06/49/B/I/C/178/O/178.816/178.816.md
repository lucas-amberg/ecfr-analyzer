# ยง 178.816   Topple test.

(a) *General.* The topple test must be conducted for the qualification of all flexible IBC design types.


(b) *Special preparation for the topple test.* The flexible IBC must be filled to not less than 95 percent of its capacity and to its maximum net mass, with the load being evenly distributed.


(c) *Test method.* A flexible IBC must be toppled onto any part of its top upon a rigid, non-resilient, smooth, flat, and horizontal surface.


(d) *Topple height.* For all flexible IBCs, the topple height is specified as follows:


(1) Packing Group I: 1.8 m (5.9 feet).


(2) Packing Group II: 1.2 m (3.9 feet).


(3) Packing Group III: 0.8 m (2.6 feet).


(e) *Criteria for passing the test.* For all flexible IBCs, there may be no loss of contents. A slight discharge (e.g., from closures or stitch holes) upon impact is not considered to be a failure, provided no further leakage occurs.
