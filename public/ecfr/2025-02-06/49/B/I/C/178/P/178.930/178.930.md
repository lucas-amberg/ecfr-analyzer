# § 178.930   Standards for fiberboard Large Packagings.

(a) The provisions in this section apply to fiberboard Large Packagings intended to contain solids. Rigid fiberboard Large Packaging types are designated:


(1) 50G fiberboard


(2) [Reserved]


(b) *Construction requirements for fiberboard Large Packagings.* (1) Fiberboard Large Packagings must be constructed of strong, solid or double-faced corrugated fiberboard (single or multiwall) that is appropriate to the capacity of the Large Packagings and to their intended use. Water resistance of the outer surface must be such that the increase in mass, as determined in a test carried out over a period of 30 minutes by the Cobb method of determining water absorption, is not greater than 155 grams per square meter (0.0316 pounds per square foot)—*see* ISO 535 (E) (IBR, *see* § 171.7 of this subchapter). Fiberboard must have proper bending qualities. Fiberboard must be cut, creased without cutting through any thickness of fiberboard, and slotted so as to permit assembly without cracking, surface breaks or undue bending. The fluting or corrugated fiberboard must be firmly glued to the facings.


(i) The walls, including top and bottom, must have a minimum puncture resistance of 15 Joules (11 foot-pounds of energy) measured according to ISO 3036 (IBR, *see* § 171.7 of this subchapter).


(ii) Manufacturers' joints in the outer packaging of Large Packagings must be made with an appropriate overlap and be taped, glued, stitched with metal staples or fastened by other means at least equally effective. Where joints are made by gluing or taping, a water resistant adhesive must be used. Metal staples must pass completely through all pieces to be fastened and be formed or protected so that any inner liner cannot be abraded or punctured by them.


(2) *Integral and detachable pallets.* (i) Any integral pallet base forming part of a Large Packaging or any detachable pallet must be suitable for mechanical handling with the Large Packaging filled to its maximum permissible gross mass.


(ii) The pallet or integral base must be designed to avoid protrusions causing damage to the fiberboard Large Packagings in handling.


(iii) The body must be secured to any detached pallet to ensure stability in handling and transport. Where a detachable pallet is used, its top surface must be free from protrusions that might damage the Large Packaging.


(3) Strengthening devices, such as timber supports to increase stacking performance may be used but must be external to the liner.


(4) The load-bearing surfaces of Large Packagings intended for stacking must be designed to distribute the load in a stable manner.


(c) Fiberboard Large Packagings may not have a volumetric capacity greater than 3,000 L (793 gallons) and not less than 450 L (119 gallons).
