# ยง 178.1055   Stacking test.

(a) *General.* The stacking test must be conducted for the qualification of all Flexible Bulk Containers design types.


(b) *Special preparation for the stacking test.* All Flexible Bulk Containers design types must be loaded to their maximum permissible gross mass.


(c) *Test method.* (1) All Flexible Bulk Containers must be placed on their base on level, hard ground and subjected to a uniformly distributed superimposed test load that is four times the design type maximum gross weight for a period of at least twenty-four hours.


(2) For all Flexible Bulk Containers, the load must be applied by one of the following methods:


(i) Four Flexible Bulk Containers of the same type loaded to their maximum permissible gross mass and stacked on the test Flexible Bulk Container;


(ii) The calculated superimposed test load weight loaded on either a flat plate or a reproduction of the base of the Flexible Bulk Container, which is stacked on the test Flexible Bulk Container.


(d) *Criteria for passing the test.* There may be no deterioration that renders the Flexible Bulk Container unsafe for transportation and no loss of contents during the test or after removal of the test load.
