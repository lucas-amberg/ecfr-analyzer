# § 179.100-7   Materials.

(a) *Steel plate:* Steel plate materials used to fabricate tank shell and manway nozzle must comply with one of the following specifications with the indicated minimum tensile strength and elongation in the welded condition. The maximum allowable carbon content must be 0.31 percent when the individual specification allows carbon greater than this amount. The plates may be clad with other approved materials.


(b) *Aluminum alloy plate:* Aluminum alloy plate material used to fabricate tank shell and manway nozzle must be suitable for fusion welding and must comply with one of the following specifications (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter) with its indicated minimum tensile strength and elongation in the welded condition. * * * 


(c) *High alloy steel plate.* (1) High alloy steel plate must conform to the following specifications:


(2)(i) High alloy steels used to fabricate tank must be tested in accordance with the following procedures in ASTM A 262, “Standard Practices for Detecting Susceptibility to Intergranular Attack in Austenitic Stainless Steel” (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), and must exhibit corrosion rates not exceeding the following: * * * 


(ii) Type 304L and 316L test specimens must be given a sensitizing treatment prior to testing.


(d) All attachments welded to tank shell must be of approved material which is suitable for welding to the tank.
