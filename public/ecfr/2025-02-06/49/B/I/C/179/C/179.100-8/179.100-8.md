# § 179.100-8   Tank heads.

(a) The tank head shape shall be an ellipsoid of revolution in which the major axis shall equal the diameter of the shell adjacent to the head and the minor axis shall be one-half the major axis.


(b) Each tank head made from steel which is required to be “fine grain” by the material specification, which is hot formed at a temperature exceeding 1700 °F., must be normalized after forming by heating to a temperature between 1550° and 1700 °F., by holding at that temperature for at least 1 hour per inch of thickness (30-minute minimum), and then by cooling in air. If the material specification requires quenching and tempering, the treatment specified in that specification must be used instead of the one specified above.
