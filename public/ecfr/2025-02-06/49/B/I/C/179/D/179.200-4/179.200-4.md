# § 179.200-4   Insulation.

(a) If insulation is applied, the tank shell and expansion dome when used must be insulated with an approved material. The entire insulation must be covered with a metal jacket of a thickness not less than 11 gauge (0.1196 inch) nominal (Manufacturer's Standard Gauge) and flashed around all openings so as to be weather tight. The exterior surface of a carbon steel tank and the inside surface of a carbon steel jacket must be given a protection coating.


(b) If insulation is a specification requirement, it shall be of sufficient thickness so that the thermal conductance at 60 °F is not more than 0.225 Btu per hour, per square foot, per degree F temperature differential, unless otherwise provided in § 179.201-1. If exterior heaters are attached to tank, the thickness of the insulation over each heater element may be reduced to one-half that required for the shell.
