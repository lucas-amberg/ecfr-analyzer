# ยง 179.300-6   Thickness of plates.

(a) For class DOT-110A tanks, the wall thickness after forming of the cylindrical portion of the tank must not be less than that specified in ยง 179.301 nor that calculated by the following formula:


(b) For class DOT-106A tanks, the wall thickness of the cylindrical portion of the tank shall not be less than that specified in ยง 179.301 and shall be such that at the tank test pressure the maximum fiber stress in the wall of the tank will not exceed 15,750 p.s.i. as calculated by the following formula:


(c) If plates are clad with material having tensile strength at least equal to the base plate, the cladding may be considered a part of the base plate when determining the thickness. If cladding material does not have tensile strength at least equal to the base plate, the base plate alone shall meet the thickness requirements.
