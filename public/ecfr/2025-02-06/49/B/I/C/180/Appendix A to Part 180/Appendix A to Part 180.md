# Appendix A to Part 180â€”Internal Self-closing Stop Valve Emergency Closure Test for Liquefied Compressed Gases


1. In performing this test, all internal self-closing stop valves must be opened. Each emergency discharge control remote actuator (on-truck and off-truck) must be operated to ensure that each internal self-closing stop valve's lever, piston, or other valve indicator has moved to the closed position.


2. On pump-actuated pressure differential internal valves, the three-way toggle valve handle or its cable attachment must be activated to verify that the toggle handle moves to the closed position.
