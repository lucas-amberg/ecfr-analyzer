# Appendix D to Part 180—Hazardous Materials Corrosive to Tanks or Service Equipment


This list contains materials identified either by proper shipping name in 49 CFR 172.101 or shipped under an “n.o.s.” shipping description that, under certain conditions, can corrode carbon steel tanks or service equipment at a rate that may reduce the design level of reliability and safety of the tank or equipment to an unsafe level before the next qualification. Materials identified on this list are considered corrosive to the tank or service equipment.


While every effort was made to identify materials deemed corrosive to the tank or service equipment, owners and operators are cautioned that this list may not be inclusive. Tank car owners and operators are reminded of their duty to ensure that no in-service tank will deteriorate below the specified minimum thickness requirements in this subchapter. See § 180.509(f)(3). In addition, FRA states a tank car owner must designate an internal coating or lining appropriately based on its knowledge of the chemical and not rely simply on this list. Regarding future thickness tests, this list may also be modified based on an analysis of the test results by the car owner, the Department of Transportation, or the Association of American Railroads' Tank Car Committee.
