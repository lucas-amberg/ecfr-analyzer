(e) *Exemption portable tanks based on DOT 51 portable tanks.* The owner of a portable tank constructed in accordance with and used under an exemption issued prior to August 31, 1996, which was in conformance with the requirements for Specification DOT 51 portable tanks with the exception of the location of fill and discharge outlets, shall examine the portable tank and its design to determine if it meets the outlet requirements in effect on October 1, 1996. If the owner determines that the portable tank is in compliance with all requirements of the DOT 51 specification, the exemption number stenciled on the portable tank shall be removed and the specification plate (or a plate placed adjacent to the specification plate) shall be durably marked “DOT 51-E*****” (where ***** is to be replaced by the exemption number). During the period the portable tank is in service, and for one year thereafter, the owner of the portable tank must retain on file, at its principal place of business, a copy of the last exemption in effect.
