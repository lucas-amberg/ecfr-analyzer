# § 191.1   Scope.

(a) This part prescribes requirements for the reporting of incidents, safety-related conditions, annual pipeline summary data, National Operator Registry information, and other miscellaneous conditions by operators of underground natural gas storage facilities and natural gas pipeline facilities located in the United States or Puerto Rico, including underground natural gas storage facilities and pipelines within the limits of the Outer Continental Shelf as that term is defined in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331). This part applies to offshore gathering lines (except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section) and to onshore gathering lines, including Type R gathering lines as determined in § 192.8 of this chapter.


(b) This part does not apply to—


(1) Offshore gathering of gas in State waters upstream from the outlet flange of each facility where hydrocarbons are produced or where produced hydrocarbons are first separated, dehydrated, or otherwise processed, whichever facility is farther downstream;


(2) Pipelines on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) that are producer-operated and cross into State waters without first connecting to a transporting operator's facility on the OCS, upstream (generally seaward) of the last valve on the last production facility on the OCS. Safety equipment protecting PHMSA-regulated pipeline segments is not excluded. Producing operators for those pipeline segments upstream of the last valve of the last production facility on the OCS may petition the Administrator, or designee, for approval to operate under Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) regulations governing pipeline design, construction, operation, and maintenance under 49 CFR 190.9; or


(3) Pipelines on the Outer Continental Shelf upstream of the point at which operating responsibility transfers from a producing operator to a transporting operator.


(c) Sections 191.22(b) and (c) and 191.23 do not apply to the onshore gathering of gas—


(1) Through a pipeline that operates at less than 0 psig (0 kPa);


(2) Through a pipeline that is not a regulated onshore gathering pipeline; or


(3) Within inlets of the Gulf of Mexico, except for the requirements in § 192.612 of this chapter.
