# Appendix B to Part 192—Qualification of Pipe and Components


II. *Steel pipe of unknown or unlisted specification.*

A. *Bending Properties.* For pipe 2 inches (51 millimeters) or less in diameter, a length of pipe must be cold bent through at least 90 degrees around a cylindrical mandrel that has a diameter 12 times the diameter of the pipe, without developing cracks at any portion and without opening the longitudinal weld.


For pipe more than 2 inches (51 millimeters) in diameter, the pipe must meet the requirements of the flattening tests set forth in ASTM A53/A53M (incorporated by reference, *see* § 192.7), except that the number of tests must be at least equal to the minimum required in paragraph II-D of this appendix to determine yield strength.


B. *Weldability.* A girth weld must be made in the pipe by a welder who is qualified under subpart E of this part. The weld must be made under the most severe conditions under which welding will be allowed in the field and by means of the same procedure that will be used in the field. On pipe more than 4 inches (102 millimeters) in diameter, at least one test weld must be made for each 100 lengths of pipe. On pipe 4 inches (102 millimeters) or less in diameter, at least one test weld must be made for each 400 lengths of pipe. The weld must be tested in accordance with API Standard 1104 (incorporated by reference, *see* § 192.7). If the requirements of API Standard 1104 cannot be met, weldability may be established by making chemical tests for carbon and manganese, and proceeding in accordance with section IX of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (ibr, *see* 192.7). The same number of chemical tests must be made as are required for testing a girth weld.


C. *Inspection.* The pipe must be clean enough to permit adequate inspection. It must be visually inspected to ensure that it is reasonably round and straight and there are no defects which might impair the strength or tightness of the pipe.


D. *Tensile Properties.* If the tensile properties of the pipe are not known, the minimum yield strength may be taken as 24,000 p.s.i. (165 MPa) or less, or the tensile properties may be established by performing tensile tests as set forth in API Specification 5L (incorporated by reference, *see* § 192.7). All test specimens shall be selected at random and the following number of tests must be performed:


III. *Steel pipe manufactured before November 12, 1970, to earlier editions of listed specifications.* Steel pipe manufactured before November 12, 1970, in accordance with a specification of which a later edition is listed in section I of this appendix, is qualified for use under this part if the following requirements are met: 


A. *Inspection.* The pipe must be clean enough to permit adequate inspection. It must be visually inspected to ensure that it is reasonably round and straight and that there are no defects which might impair the strength or tightness of the pipe. 


B. *Similarity of specification requirements.* The edition of the listed specification under which the pipe was manufactured must have substantially the same requirements with respect to the following properties as a later edition of that specification listed in section I of this appendix: 


(1) Physical (mechanical) properties of pipe, including yield and tensile strength, elongation, and yield to tensile ratio, and testing requirements to verify those properties. 


(2) Chemical properties of pipe and testing requirements to verify those properties. 


C. *Inspection or test of welded pipe.* On pipe with welded seams, one of the following requirements must be met: 


(1) The edition of the listed specification to which the pipe was manufactured must have substantially the same requirements with respect to nondestructive inspection of welded seams and the standards for acceptance or rejection and repair as a later edition of the specification listed in section I of this appendix. 


(2) The pipe must be tested in accordance with subpart J of this part to at least 1.25 times the maximum allowable operating pressure if it is to be installed in a class 1 location and to at least 1.5 times the maximum allowable operating pressure if it is to be installed in a class 2, 3, or 4 location. Notwithstanding any shorter time period permitted under subpart J of this part, the test pressure must be maintained for at least 8 hours.
