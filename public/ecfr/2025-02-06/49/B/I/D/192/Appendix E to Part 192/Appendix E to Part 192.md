# Appendix E to Part 192—Guidance on Determining High Consequence Areas and on Carrying out Requirements in the Integrity Management Rule


To determine which segments of an operator's transmission pipeline system are covered for purposes of the integrity management program requirements, an operator must identify the high consequence areas. An operator must use method (1) or (2) from the definition in § 192.903 to identify a high consequence area. An operator may apply one method to its entire pipeline system, or an operator may apply one method to individual portions of the pipeline system. (Refer to figure E.I.A for a diagram of a high consequence area).


(a) Table E.II.1 gives guidance to help an operator implement requirements on additional preventive and mitigative measures for addressing time dependent and independent threats for a transmission pipeline operating below 30% SMYS not in an HCA (*i.e.* outside of potential impact circle) but located within a Class 3 or Class 4 Location. 


(b) Table E.II.2 gives guidance to help an operator implement requirements on assessment methods for addressing time dependent and independent threats for a transmission pipeline in an HCA. 


(c) Table E.II.3 gives guidance on preventative & mitigative measures addressing time dependent and independent threats for transmission pipelines that operate below 30% SMYS, in HCAs.
