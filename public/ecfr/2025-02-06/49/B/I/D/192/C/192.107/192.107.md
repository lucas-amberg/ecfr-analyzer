# ยง 192.107   Yield strength (

(a) For pipe that is manufactured in accordance with a specification listed in section I of appendix B of this part, the yield strength to be used in the design formula in ยง 192.105 is the SMYS stated in the listed specification, if that value is known. 


(b) For pipe that is manufactured in accordance with a specification not listed in section I of appendix B to this part or whose specification or tensile properties are unknown, the yield strength to be used in the design formula in ยง 192.105 is one of the following: 


(1) If the pipe is tensile tested in accordance with section II-D of appendix B to this part, the lower of the following: 


(i) 80 percent of the average yield strength determined by the tensile tests. 


(ii) The lowest yield strength determined by the tensile tests. 


(2) If the pipe is not tensile tested as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, 24,000 p.s.i. (165 MPa).
