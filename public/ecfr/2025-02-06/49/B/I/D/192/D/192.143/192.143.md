# ยง 192.143   General requirements.

(a) Each component of a pipeline must be able to withstand operating pressures and other anticipated loadings without impairment of its serviceability with unit stresses equivalent to those allowed for comparable material in pipe in the same location and kind of service. However, if design based upon unit stresses is impractical for a particular component, design may be based upon a pressure rating established by the manufacturer by pressure testing that component or a prototype of the component.


(b) The design and installation of pipeline components and facilities must meet applicable requirements for corrosion control found in subpart I of this part.


(c) Except for excess flow valves, each plastic pipeline component installed after January 22, 2019 must be able to withstand operating pressures and other anticipated loads in accordance with a listed specification.
