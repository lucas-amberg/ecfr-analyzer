(a) The minimum metal thickness of threaded fittings may not be less than specified for the pressures and temperatures in the applicable standards referenced in this part, or their equivalent. 


(b) Each steel butt-welding fitting must have pressure and temperature ratings based on stresses for pipe of the same or equivalent material. The actual bursting strength of the fitting must at least equal the computed bursting strength of pipe of the designated material and wall thickness, as determined by a prototype that was tested to at least the pressure required for the pipeline to which it is being added. 


(c) Plastic fittings installed after January 22, 2019, must meet a listed specification.
