# § 192.150   Passage of internal inspection devices.

(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, each new transmission line and each replacement of line pipe, valve, fitting, or other line component in a transmission line, must be designed and constructed to accommodate the passage of instrumented internal inspection devices in accordance with NACE SP0102, section 7 (incorporated by reference, *see* § 192.7).


(b) This section does not apply to: (1) Manifolds;


(2) Station piping such as at compressor stations, meter stations, or regulator stations;


(3) Piping associated with storage facilities, other than a continuous run of transmission line between a compressor station and storage facilities; 


(4) Cross-overs;


(5) Sizes of pipe for which an instrumented internal inspection device is not commercially available;


(6) Transmission lines, operated in conjunction with a distribution system which are installed in Class 4 locations;


(7) Offshore transmission lines, except transmission lines 10


3/4 inches (273 millimeters) or more in outside diameter on which construction begins after December 28, 2005, that run from platform to platform or platform to shore unless—


(i) Platform space or configuration is incompatible with launching or retrieving instrumented internal inspection devices; or


(ii) If the design includes taps for lateral connections, the operator can demonstrate, based on investigation or experience, that there is no reasonably practical alternative under the design circumstances to the use of a tap that will obstruct the passage of instrumented internal inspection devices; 


(8) Gathering lines; and


(9) Other piping that, under § 190.9 of this chapter, the Administrator finds in a particular case would be impracticable to design and construct to accommodate the passage of instrumented internal inspection devices.


(c) An operator encountering emergencies, construction time constraints or other unforeseen construction problems need not construct a new or replacement segment of a transmission line to meet paragraph (a) of this section, if the operator determines and documents why an impracticability prohibits compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. Within 30 days after discovering the emergency or construction problem the operator must petition, under § 190.9 of this chapter, for approval that design and construction to accommodate passage of instrumented internal inspection devices would be impracticable. If the petition is denied, within 1 year after the date of the notice of the denial, the operator must modify that segment to allow passage of instrumented internal inspection devices.
