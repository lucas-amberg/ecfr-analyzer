# § 192.195   Protection against accidental overpressuring.

(a) *General requirements.* Except as provided in § 192.197, each pipeline that is connected to a gas source so that the maximum allowable operating pressure could be exceeded as the result of pressure control failure or of some other type of failure, must have pressure relieving or pressure limiting devices that meet the requirements of §§ 192.199 and 192.201. 


(b) *Additional requirements for distribution systems.* Each distribution system that is supplied from a source of gas that is at a higher pressure than the maximum allowable operating pressure for the system must—


(1) Have pressure regulation devices capable of meeting the pressure, load, and other service conditions that will be experienced in normal operation of the system, and that could be activated in the event of failure of some portion of the system; and 


(2) Be designed so as to prevent accidental overpressuring.
