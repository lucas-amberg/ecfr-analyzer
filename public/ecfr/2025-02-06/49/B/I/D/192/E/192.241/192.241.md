# ยง 192.241   Inspection and test of welds.

(a) Visual inspection of welding must be conducted by an individual qualified by appropriate training and experience to ensure that:


(1) The welding is performed in accordance with the welding procedure; and 


(2) The weld is acceptable under paragraph (c) of this section. 


(b) The welds on a pipeline to be operated at a pressure that produces a hoop stress of 20 percent or more of SMYS must be nondestructively tested in accordance with ยง 192.243, except that welds that are visually inspected and approved by a qualified welding inspector need not be nondestructively tested if:


(1) The pipe has a nominal diameter of less than 6 inches (152 millimeters); or 


(2) The pipeline is to be operated at a pressure that produces a hoop stress of less than 40 percent of SMYS and the welds are so limited in number that nondestructive testing is impractical. 


(c) The acceptability of a weld that is nondestructively tested or visually inspected is determined according to the standards in section 9 or Appendix A of API Std 1104 (incorporated by reference, *see* ยง 192.7). Appendix A of API Std 1104 may not be used to accept cracks.
