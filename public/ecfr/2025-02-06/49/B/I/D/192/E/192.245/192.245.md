# ยง 192.245   Repair or removal of defects.

(a) Each weld that is unacceptable under ยง 192.241(c) must be removed or repaired. Except for welds on an offshore pipeline being installed from a pipeline vessel, a weld must be removed if it has a crack that is more than 8 percent of the weld length.


(b) Each weld that is repaired must have the defect removed down to sound metal and the segment to be repaired must be preheated if conditions exist which would adversely affect the quality of the weld repair. After repair, the segment of the weld that was repaired must be inspected to ensure its acceptability.


(c) Repair of a crack, or of any defect in a previously repaired area must be in accordance with written weld repair procedures that have been qualified under ยง 192.225. Repair procedures must provide that the minimum mechanical properties specified for the welding procedure used to make the original weld are met upon completion of the final weld repair.
