# ยง 192.363   Service lines: Valve requirements.

(a) Each service line must have a service-line valve that meets the applicable requirements of subparts B and D of this part. A valve incorporated in a meter bar, that allows the meter to be bypassed, may not be used as a service-line valve. 


(b) A soft seat service line valve may not be used if its ability to control the flow of gas could be adversely affected by exposure to anticipated heat. 


(c) Each service-line valve on a high-pressure service line, installed above ground or in an area where the blowing of gas would be hazardous, must be designed and constructed to minimize the possibility of the removal of the core of the valve with other than specialized tools.
