# ยง 192.367   Service lines: General requirements for connections to main piping.

(a) *Location.* Each service line connection to a main must be located at the top of the main or, if that is not practical, at the side of the main, unless a suitable protective device is installed to minimize the possibility of dust and moisture being carried from the main into the service line. 


(b) *Compression-type connection to main.* Each compression-type service line to main connection must:


(1) Be designed and installed to effectively sustain the longitudinal pull-out or thrust forces caused by contraction or expansion of the piping, or by anticipated external or internal loading;


(2) If gaskets are used in connecting the service line to the main connection fitting, have gaskets that are compatible with the kind of gas in the system; and


(3) If used on pipelines comprised of plastic, be a Category 1 connection as defined by a listed specification for the applicable material, providing a seal plus resistance to a force on the pipe joint equal to or greater than that which will cause no less than 25% elongation of pipe, or the pipe fails outside the joint area if tested in accordance with the applicable standard.
