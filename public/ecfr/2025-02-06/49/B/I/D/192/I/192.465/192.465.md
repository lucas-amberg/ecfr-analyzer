# § 192.465   External corrosion control: Monitoring and remediation.

(a) Each pipeline that is under cathodic protection must be tested at least once each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 15 months, to determine whether the cathodic protection meets the requirements of § 192.463. However, if tests at those intervals are impractical for separately protected short sections of mains or transmission lines, not in excess of 100 feet (30 meters), or separately protected service lines, these pipelines may be surveyed on a sampling basis. At least 10 percent of these protected structures, distributed over the entire system must be surveyed each calendar year, with a different 10 percent checked each subsequent year, so that the entire system is tested in each 10-year period.


(b) Cathodic protection rectifiers and impressed current power sources must be periodically inspected as follows:


(1) Each cathodic protection rectifier or impressed current power source must be inspected six times each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 2
1/2 months between inspections, to ensure adequate amperage and voltage levels needed to provide cathodic protection are maintained. This may be done either through remote measurement or through an onsite inspection of the rectifier.


(2) After January 1, 2022, each remotely inspected rectifier must be physically inspected for continued safe and reliable operation at least once each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 15 months.


(c) Each reverse current switch, each diode, and each interference bond whose failure would jeopardize structure protection must be electrically checked for proper performance six times each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 2
1/2 months. Each other interference bond must be checked at least once each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 15 months. 


(d) Each operator must promptly correct any deficiencies indicated by the inspection and testing required by paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. For onshore gas transmission pipelines, each operator must develop a remedial action plan and apply for any necessary permits within 6 months of completing the inspection or testing that identified the deficiency. Remedial action must be completed promptly, but no later than the earliest of the following: prior to the next inspection or test interval required by this section; within 1 year, not to exceed 15 months, of the inspection or test that identified the deficiency; or as soon as practicable, not to exceed 6 months, after obtaining any necessary permits.


(e) After the initial evaluation required by §§ 192.455(b) and (c) and 192.457(b), each operator must, not less than every 3 years at intervals not exceeding 39 months, reevaluate its unprotected pipelines and cathodically protect them in accordance with this subpart in areas in which active corrosion is found. The operator must determine the areas of active corrosion by electrical survey. However, on distribution lines and where an electrical survey is impractical on transmission lines, areas of active corrosion may be determined by other means that include review and analysis of leak repair and inspection records, corrosion monitoring records, exposed pipe inspection records, and the pipeline environment.


(f) An operator must determine the extent of the area with inadequate cathodic protection for onshore gas transmission pipelines where any annual test station reading (pipe-to-soil potential measurement) indicates cathodic protection levels below the required levels in appendix D to this part.


(1) Gas transmission pipeline operators must investigate and mitigate any non-systemic or location-specific causes.


(2) To address systemic causes, an operator must conduct close interval surveys in both directions from the test station with a low cathodic protection reading at a maximum interval of approximately 5 feet or less. An operator must conduct close interval surveys unless it is impractical based upon geographical, technical, or safety reasons. An operator must complete close interval surveys required by this section with the protective current interrupted unless it is impractical to do so for technical or safety reasons. An operator must remediate areas with insufficient cathodic protection levels, or areas where protective current is found to be leaving the pipeline, in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. An operator must confirm the restoration of adequate cathodic protection following the implementation of remedial actions undertaken to mitigate systemic causes of external corrosion.
