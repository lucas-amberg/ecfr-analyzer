# ยง 192.487   Remedial measures: Distribution lines other than cast iron or ductile iron lines.

(a) *General corrosion.* Except for cast iron or ductile iron pipe, each segment of generally corroded distribution line pipe with a remaining wall thickness less than that required for the MAOP of the pipeline, or a remaining wall thickness less than 30 percent of the nominal wall thickness, must be replaced. However, corroded pipe may be repaired by a method that reliable engineering tests and analyses show can permanently restore the serviceability of the pipe. Corrosion pitting so closely grouped as to affect the overall strength of the pipe is considered general corrosion for the purpose of this paragraph.


(b) *Localized corrosion pitting.* Except for cast iron or ductile iron pipe, each segment of distribution line pipe with localized corrosion pitting to a degree where leakage might result must be replaced or repaired.
