Except for service lines and plastic pipelines, each segment of a pipeline that is to be operated below 100 p.s.i. (689 kPa) gage must be leak tested in accordance with the following: 


(a) The test procedure used must ensure discovery of all potentially hazardous leaks in the segment being tested. 


(b) Each main that is to be operated at less than 1 p.s.i. (6.9 kPa) gage must be tested to at least 10 p.s.i. (69 kPa) gage and each main to be operated at or above 1 p.s.i. (6.9 kPa) gage must be tested to at least 90 p.s.i. (621 kPa) gage.
