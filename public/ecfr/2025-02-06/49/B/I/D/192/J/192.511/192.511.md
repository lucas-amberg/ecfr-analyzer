(a) Each segment of a service line (other than plastic) must be leak tested in accordance with this section before being placed in service. If feasible, the service line connection to the main must be included in the test; if not feasible, it must be given a leakage test at the operating pressure when placed in service. 


(b) Each segment of a service line (other than plastic) intended to be operated at a pressure of at least 1 p.s.i. (6.9 kPa) gage but not more than 40 p.s.i. (276 kPa) gage must be given a leak test at a pressure of not less than 50 p.s.i. (345 kPa) gage. 


(c) Each segment of a service line (other than plastic) intended to be operated at pressures of more than 40 p.s.i. (276 kPa) gage must be tested to at least 90 p.s.i. (621 kPa) gage, except that each segment of a steel service line stressed to 20 percent or more of SMYS must be tested in accordance with ยง 192.507 of this subpart.
