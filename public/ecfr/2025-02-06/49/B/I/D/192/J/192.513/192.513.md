# § 192.513   Test requirements for plastic pipelines.

(a) Each segment of a plastic pipeline must be tested in accordance with this section. 


(b) The test procedure must insure discovery of all potentially hazardous leaks in the segment being tested. 


(c) The test pressure must be at least 150% of the maximum operating pressure or 50 psi (345 kPa) gauge, whichever is greater. However, the maximum test pressure may not be more than 2.5 times the pressure determined under § 192.121 at a temperature not less than the pipe temperature during the test.


(d) During the test, the temperature of thermoplastic material may not be more than 100 °F (38 °C), or the temperature at which the material's long-term hydrostatic strength has been determined under the listed specification, whichever is greater.
