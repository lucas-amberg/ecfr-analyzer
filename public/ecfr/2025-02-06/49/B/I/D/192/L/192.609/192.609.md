# ยง 192.609   Change in class location: Required study.

Whenever an increase in population density indicates a change in class location for a segment of an existing steel pipeline operating at hoop stress that is more than 40 percent of SMYS, or indicates that the hoop stress corresponding to the established maximum allowable operating pressure for a segment of existing pipeline is not commensurate with the present class location, the operator shall immediately make a study to determine:


(a) The present class location for the segment involved. 


(b) The design, construction, and testing procedures followed in the original construction, and a comparison of these procedures with those required for the present class location by the applicable provisions of this part. 


(c) The physical condition of the segment to the extent it can be ascertained from available records; 


(d) The operating and maintenance history of the segment; 


(e) The maximum actual operating pressure and the corresponding operating hoop stress, taking pressure gradient into account, for the segment of pipeline involved; and 


(f) The actual area affected by the population density increase, and physical barriers or other factors which may limit further expansion of the more densely populated area.
