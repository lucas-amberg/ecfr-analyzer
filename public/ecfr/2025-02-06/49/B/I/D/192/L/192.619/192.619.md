# § 192.619   Maximum allowable operating pressure: Steel or plastic pipelines.

(a) No person may operate a segment of steel or plastic pipeline at a pressure that exceeds a maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) determined under paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this section, or the lowest of the following:


(1) The design pressure of the weakest element in the segment, determined in accordance with subparts C and D of this part. However, for steel pipe in pipelines being converted under § 192.14 or uprated under subpart K of this part, if any variable necessary to determine the design pressure under the design formula (§ 192.105) is unknown, one of the following pressures is to be used as design pressure: 


(i) Eighty percent of the first test pressure that produces yield undersection N5 of Appendix N of ASME B31.8 (incorporated by reference, *see* § 192.7), reduced by the appropriate factor in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section; or 


(ii) If the pipe is 12
3/4 inches (324 mm) or less in outside diameter and is not tested to yield under this paragraph, 200 p.s.i. (1379 kPa). 


(2) The pressure obtained by dividing the pressure to which the pipeline segment was tested after construction as follows:


(i) For plastic pipe in all locations, the test pressure is divided by 

a factor of 1.5.


(ii) For steel pipe operated at 100 psi (689 kPa) gage or more, the test pressure is divided by a factor determined in accordance with the Table 1 to paragraph (a)(2)(ii):


(3) The highest actual operating pressure to which the segment was subjected during the 5 years preceding the applicable date in the second column. This pressure restriction applies unless the segment was tested according to the requirements in paragraph (a)(2) of this section after the applicable date in the third column or the segment was uprated according to the requirements in subpart K of this part:


(4) The pressure determined by the operator to be the maximum safe pressure after considering and accounting for records of material properties, including material properties verified in accordance with § 192.607, if applicable, and the history of the pipeline segment, including known corrosion and actual operating pressure. 


(b) No person may operate a segment to which paragraph (a)(4) of this section is applicable, unless over-pressure protective devices are installed on the segment in a manner that will prevent the maximum allowable operating pressure from being exceeded, in accordance with § 192.195. 


(c) The requirements on pressure restrictions in this section do not apply in the following instances:


(1) An operator may operate a segment of pipeline found to be in satisfactory condition, considering its operating and maintenance history, at the highest actual operating pressure to which the segment was subjected during the 5 years preceding the applicable date in the second column of the table in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. An operator must still comply with § 192.611.


(2) For any Type C gas gathering pipeline under § 192.9 existing on or before May 16, 2022, that was not previously subject to this part and the operator cannot determine the actual operating pressure of the pipeline for the 5 years preceding May 16, 2023, the operator may establish MAOP using other criteria based on a combination of operating conditions, other tests, and design with approval from PHMSA. The operator must notify PHMSA in accordance with § 192.18. The notification must include the following information:


(i) The proposed MAOP of the pipeline;


(ii) Description of pipeline segment for which alternate methods are used to establish MAOP, including diameter, wall thickness, pipe grade, seam type, location, endpoints, other pertinent material properties, and age;


(iii) Pipeline operating data, including operating history and maintenance history;


(iv) Description of methods being used to establish MAOP;


(v) Technical justification for use of the methods chosen to establish MAOP; and


(vi) Evidence of review and acceptance of the justification by a qualified technical subject matter expert.


(d) The operator of a pipeline segment of steel pipeline meeting the conditions prescribed in § 192.620(b) may elect to operate the segment at a maximum allowable operating pressure determined under § 192.620(a).


(e) Notwithstanding the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, operators of onshore steel transmission pipelines that meet the criteria specified in § 192.624(a) must establish and document the maximum allowable operating pressure in accordance with § 192.624.


(f) Operators of onshore steel transmission pipelines must make and retain records necessary to establish and document the MAOP of each pipeline segment in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section as follows:


(1) Operators of pipelines in operation as of July 1, 2020 must retain any existing records establishing MAOP for the life of the pipeline;


(2) Operators of pipelines in operation as of July 1, 2020 that do not have records establishing MAOP and are required to reconfirm MAOP in accordance with § 192.624, must retain the records reconfirming MAOP for the life of the pipeline; and


(3) Operators of pipelines placed in operation after July 1, 2020 must make and retain records establishing MAOP for the life of the pipeline.
