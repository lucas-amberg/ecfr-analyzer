# § 192.740   Pressure regulating, limiting, and overpressure protection—Individual service lines directly connected to regulated gathering or transmission pipelines.

(a) This section applies, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, to any service line directly connected to a transmission pipeline or regulated gathering pipeline as determined in § 192.8 that is not operated as part of a distribution system.


(b) Each pressure regulating or limiting device, relief device (except rupture discs), automatic shutoff device, and associated equipment must be inspected and tested at least once every 3 calendar years, not exceeding 39 months, to determine that it is:


(1) In good mechanical condition;


(2) Adequate from the standpoint of capacity and reliability of operation for the service in which it is employed;


(3) Set to control or relieve at the correct pressure consistent with the pressure limits of § 192.197; and to limit the pressure on the inlet of the service regulator to 60 psi (414 kPa) gauge or less in case the upstream regulator fails to function properly; and


(4) Properly installed and protected from dirt, liquids, or other conditions that might prevent proper operation.


(c) This section does not apply to equipment installed on:


(1) A service line that only serves engines that power irrigation pumps;
