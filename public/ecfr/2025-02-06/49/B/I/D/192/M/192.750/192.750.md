Any launcher or receiver used after July 1, 2021, must be equipped with a device capable of safely relieving pressure in the barrel before removal or opening of the launcher or receiver barrel closure or flange and insertion or removal of in-line inspection tools, scrapers, or spheres. An operator must use a device to either: Indicate that pressure has been relieved in the barrel; or alternatively prevent opening of the barrel closure or flange when pressurized, or insertion or removal of in-line devices (*e.g.* inspection tools, scrapers, or spheres), if pressure has not been relieved.
