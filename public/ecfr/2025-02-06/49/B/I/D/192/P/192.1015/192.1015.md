# ยง 192.1015   What must a small LPG operator do to implement this subpart?

(a) *General.* No later than August 2, 2011, a small LPG operator must develop and implement an IM program that includes a written IM plan as specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The IM program for these pipelines should reflect the relative simplicity of these types of pipelines.


(b) *Elements.* A written integrity management plan must address, at a minimum, the following elements:


(1) *Knowledge.* The operator must demonstrate knowledge of its pipeline, which, to the extent known, should include the approximate location and material of its pipeline. The operator must identify additional information needed and provide a plan for gaining knowledge over time through normal activities conducted on the pipeline (for example, design, construction, operations or maintenance activities).


(2) *Identify threats.* The operator must consider, at minimum, the following categories of threats (existing and potential): Corrosion (including atmospheric corrosion), natural forces, excavation damage, other outside force damage, material or weld failure, equipment failure, and incorrect operation.


(3) *Rank risks.* The operator must evaluate the risks to its pipeline and estimate the relative importance of each identified threat.


(4) *Identify and implement measures to mitigate risks.* The operator must determine and implement measures designed to reduce the risks from failure of its pipeline.


(5) *Measure performance, monitor results, and evaluate effectiveness.* The operator must monitor, as a performance measure, the number of leaks eliminated or repaired on its pipeline and their causes.


(6) *Periodic evaluation and improvement.* The operator must determine the appropriate period for conducting IM program evaluations based on the complexity of its pipeline and changes in factors affecting the risk of failure. An operator must re-evaluate its entire program at least every 5 years. The operator must consider the results of the performance monitoring in these evaluations.


(c) *Records.* The operator must maintain, for a period of at least 10 years, the following records:


(1) A written IM plan in accordance with this section, including superseded IM plans;


(2) Documents supporting threat identification; and


(3) Documents showing the location and material of all piping and appurtenances that are installed after the effective date of the operator's IM program and, to the extent known, the location and material of all pipe and appurtenances that were existing on the effective date of the operator's program.
