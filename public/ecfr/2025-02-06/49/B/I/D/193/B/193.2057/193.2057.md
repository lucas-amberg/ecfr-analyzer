# ยง 193.2057   Thermal radiation protection.

Each LNG container and LNG transfer system must have a thermal exclusion zone in accordance with section 2.2.3.2 of NFPA-59A-2001 (incorporated by reference, *see* ยง 193.2013) with the following exceptions: 


(a) The thermal radiation distances must be calculated using Gas Technology Institute's (GTI) report or computer model GTI-04/0032 LNGFIRE3: A Thermal Radiation Model for LNG Fires (incorporated by reference, *see* ยง 193.2013). The use of other alternate models which take into account the same physical factors and have been validated by experimental test data may be permitted subject to the Administrator's approval.


(b) In calculating exclusion distances, the wind speed producing the maximum exclusion distances shall be used except for wind speeds that occur less than 5 percent of the time based on recorded data for the area. 


(c) In calculating exclusion distances, the ambient temperature and relative humidity that produce the maximum exclusion distances shall be used except for values that occur less than five percent of the time based on recorded data for the area.
