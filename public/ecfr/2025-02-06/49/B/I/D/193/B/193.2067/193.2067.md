# ยง 193.2067   Wind forces.

(a) LNG facilities must be designed to withstand without loss of structural or functional integrity:


(1) The direct effect of wind forces;


(2) The pressure differential between the interior and exterior of a confining, or partially confining, structure; and


(3) In the case of impounding systems for LNG storage tanks, impact forces and potential penetrations by wind borne missiles. 


(b) The wind forces at the location of the specific facility must be based on one of the following:


(1) For shop fabricated containers of LNG or other hazardous fluids with a capacity of not more than 70,000 gallons, applicable wind load data in ASCE/SEI 7 (incorporated by reference, *see* ยง 193.2013).


(2) For all other LNG facilities:


(i) An assumed sustained wind velocity of not less than 150 miles per hour, unless the Administrator finds a lower velocity is justified by adequate supportive data; or 


(ii) The most critical combination of wind velocity and duration, with respect to the effect on the structure, having a probability of exceedance in a 50-year period of 0.5 percent or less, if adequate wind data are available and the probabilistic methodology is reliable.
