Each impounding system serving an LNG storage tank must have a minimum volumetric liquid impoundment capacity of: 


(a) 110 percent of the LNG tank's maximum liquid capacity for an impoundment serving a single tank; 


(b) 100 percent of all tanks or 110 percent of the largest tank's maximum liquid capacity, whichever is greater, for the impoundment serving more than one tank; or 


(c) If the dike is designed to account for a surge in the event of catastrophic failure, then the impoundment capacity may be reduced to 100 percent in lieu of 110 percent.
