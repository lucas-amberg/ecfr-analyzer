*Nominal wall thickness* means the wall thickness listed in the pipe specifications.


*Notification of potential rupture* means the notification to, or observation by, an operator of indicia identified in § 195.417 of a potential unintentional or uncontrolled release of a large volume of commodity from a pipeline. This definition does not apply to any gathering line.
