# § 195.559   What coating material may I use for external corrosion control?

Coating material for external corrosion control under § 195.557 must—


(a) Be designed to mitigate corrosion of the buried or submerged pipeline; 


(b) Have sufficient adhesion to the metal surface to prevent under film migration of moisture; 


(c) Be sufficiently ductile to resist cracking; 


(d) Have enough strength to resist damage due to handling and soil stress; 


(e) Support any supplemental cathodic protection; and 


(f) If the coating is an insulating type, have low moisture absorption and provide high electrical resistance.
