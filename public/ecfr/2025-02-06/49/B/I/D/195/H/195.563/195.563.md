# § 195.563   Which pipelines must have cathodic protection?

(a) Each buried or submerged pipeline that is constructed, relocated, replaced, or otherwise changed after the applicable date in § 195.401(c) must have cathodic protection. The cathodic protection must be in operation not later than 1 year after the pipeline is constructed, relocated, replaced, or otherwise changed, as applicable. 


(b) Each buried or submerged pipeline converted under § 195.5 must have cathodic protection if the pipeline—


(1) Has cathodic protection that substantially meets § 195.571 before the pipeline is placed in service; or 


(2) Is a segment that is relocated, replaced, or substantially altered. 


(c) All other buried or submerged pipelines that have an effective external coating must have cathodic protection. 
1 Except as provided by paragraph (d) of this section, this requirement does not apply to breakout tanks and does not apply to buried piping in breakout tank areas and pumping stations until December 29, 2003. 


(d) Bare pipelines, breakout tank areas, and buried pumping station piping must have cathodic protection in places where regulations in effect before January 28, 2002 required cathodic protection as a result of electrical inspections. See previous editions of this part in 49 CFR, parts 186 to 199. 


(e) Unprotected pipe must have cathodic protection if required by § 195.573(b).
