# § 195.565   How do I install cathodic protection on breakout tanks?

After October 2, 2000, when you install cathodic protection under § 195.563(a) to protect the bottom of an aboveground breakout tank of more than 500 barrels 79.49m3 capacity built to API Spec 12F (incorporated by reference, *see* § 195.3), API Std 620 (incorporated by reference, *see* § 195.3), API Std 650 (incorporated by reference, *see* § 195.3), or API Std 650's predecessor, Standard 12C, you must install the system in accordance with ANSI/API RP 651 (incorporated by reference, *see* § 195.3). However, you don't need to comply with API RP 651 when installing any tank for which you note in the corrosion control procedures established under § 195.402(c)(3) why complying with all or certain provisions of API RP 651 is not necessary for the safety of the tank.
