# ยง 195.567   Which pipelines must have test leads and what must I do to install and maintain the leads?

(a) *General.* Except for offshore pipelines, each buried or submerged pipeline or segment of pipeline under cathodic protection required by this subpart must have electrical test leads for external corrosion control. However, this requirement does not apply until December 27, 2004 to pipelines or pipeline segments on which test leads were not required by regulations in effect before January 28, 2002. 


(b) *Installation.* You must install test leads as follows: 


(1) Locate the leads at intervals frequent enough to obtain electrical measurements indicating the adequacy of cathodic protection. 


(2) Provide enough looping or slack so backfilling will not unduly stress or break the lead and the lead will otherwise remain mechanically secure and electrically conductive. 


(3) Prevent lead attachments from causing stress concentrations on pipe. 


(4) For leads installed in conduits, suitably insulate the lead from the conduit. 


(5) At the connection to the pipeline, coat each bared test lead wire and bared metallic area with an electrical insulating material compatible with the pipe coating and the insulation on the wire. 


(c) *Maintenance.* You must maintain the test lead wires in a condition that enables you to obtain electrical measurements to determine whether cathodic protection complies with ยง 195.571.
