# § 198.37   State one-call damage prevention program.

A State must adopt a one-call damage prevention program that requires each of the following at a minimum:


(a) Each area of the State that contains underground pipeline facilities must be covered by a one-call notification system.


(b) Each one-call notification system must be operated in accordance with § 198.39.


(c) Excavators must be required to notify the operational center of the one-call notification system that covers the area of each intended excavation activity and provide the following information:


(1) Name of the person notifying the system.


(2) Name, address and telephone number of the excavator.


(3) Specific location, starting date, and description of the intended excavation activity.


(d) The State must determine whether telephonic and other communications to the operational center of a one-call notification system under paragraph (c) of this section are to be toll free or not.


(e) Except with respect to interstate transmission facilities as defined in the pipeline safety laws (49 U.S.C. 60101 *et seq.*), operators of underground pipeline facilities must be required to participate in the one-call notification systems that cover the areas of the State in which those pipeline facilities are located. 


(f) Operators of underground pipeline facilities participating in the one-call notification systems must be required to respond in the manner prescribed by § 192.614 (c)(4) through (c)(6) of this chapter to notices of intended excavation activity received from the operational center of a one-call notification system. 


(g) Persons who operate one-call notification systems or operators of underground pipeline facilities participating or required to participate in the one-call notification systems must be required to notify the public and known excavators in the manner prescribed by § 192.614 (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this chapter of the availability and use of one-call notification systems to locate underground pipeline facilities. However, this paragraph does not apply to persons (including operator's master meters) whose primary activity does not include the production, transportation or marketing of gas or hazardous liquids.


(h) Operators of underground pipeline facilities (other than operators of interstate transmission facilities as defined in the pipeline safety laws (49 U.S.C. 60101 *et seq.*), and interstate pipelines as defined in § 195.2 of this chapter), excavators and persons who operate one-call notification systems who violate the applicable requirements of this subpart must be subject to civil penalties and injunctive relief that are substantially the same as are provided under the pipeline safety laws (49 U.S.C. 60101 *et seq.*).
