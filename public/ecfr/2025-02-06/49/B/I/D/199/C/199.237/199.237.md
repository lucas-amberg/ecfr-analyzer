(a) No operator shall permit a covered employee tested under the provisions of ยง 199.225, who is found to have an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04, to perform or continue to perform covered functions, until: 


(1) The employee's alcohol concentration measures less than 0.02 in accordance with a test administered under ยง 199.225(e); or 


(2) The start of the employee's next regularly scheduled duty period, but not less than eight hours following administration of the test. 


(b) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, no operator shall take any action under this subpart against an employee based solely on test results showing an alcohol concentration less than 0.04.
