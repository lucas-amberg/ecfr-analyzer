# ยง 211.29   Petitions for reconsideration of a final rule.

(a) Any person may petition the Administrator for reconsideration of any rule issued under this part.

The petition must contain a brief statement of the complaint and an explanation as to why compliance with the rule is not possible, is not practicable, is unreasonable, or is not in the public interest.


(b) If the petitioner requests consideration of additional facts, he must state the reason they were not presented to the Administrator within the allotted time.


(c) The Administrator does not consider repetitious petitions.


(d) Unless the Administrator specifically provides otherwise, and publishes notice thereof in the _Federal Register,_ the filing of a petition under this section does not stay the effectiveness of a rule.
