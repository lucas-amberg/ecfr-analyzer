# § 211.33   Direct final rulemaking procedures.

(a) Rules that the Administrator judges to be noncontroversial and unlikely to result in adverse public comment may be published in the final rule section of the _Federal Register_ as direct final rules. These include noncontroversial rules that:


(1) Affect internal procedures of the Federal Railroad Administration, such as filing requirements and rules governing inspection and copying of documents,


(2) Are nonsubstantive clarifications or corrections to existing rules,


(3) Update existing forms, and


(4) Make minor changes in the substantive rules regarding statistics and reporting requirements.


(b) The _Federal Register_ document will state that any adverse comment must be received in writing by the Federal Railroad Administration within the specified time after the date of publication and that, if no written adverse comment or request for oral hearing (if such opportunity is required by statute) is received, the rule will become effective a specified number of days after the date of publication.


(c) If no adverse comment or request for oral hearing is received by the Federal Railroad Administration within the specified time of publication in the _Federal Register,_ the Federal Railroad Administration will publish a notice in the _Federal Register_ indicating that no adverse comment was received and confirming that the rule will become effective on the date that was indicated in the direct final rule.


(d) If the Federal Railroad Administration receives any written adverse comment or request for oral hearing within the specified time of publication in the _Federal Register,_ a notice withdrawing the direct final rule will be published in the final rule section of the _Federal Register_ and, if the Federal Railroad Administration decides a rulemaking is warranted, a notice of proposed rulemaking will be published in the proposed rule section of the _Federal Register._

(e) An “adverse” comment for the purpose of this subpart means any comment that the Federal Railroad Administration determines is critical of the rule, suggests that the rule should not be adopted, or suggests a change that should be made in the rule.
