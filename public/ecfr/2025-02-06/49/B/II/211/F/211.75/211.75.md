However, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, all relevant and probative evidence offered by a party shall be received in evidence.


(b) The presiding officer may deny the admission of evidence which is determined to be—


(1) Unduly repetitive; or


(2) So extensive and lacking in relevance or probative effect that its admission would impair the prompt, orderly, and fair resolution of the proceeding.
