# § 213.353   Turnouts, crossovers, and lift rail assemblies or other transition devices on moveable bridges.

(a) In turnouts and track crossings, the fastenings must be intact and maintained so as to keep the components securely in place.

1/2 inches wide.


(d) For all turnouts and crossovers, and lift rail assemblies or other transition devices on moveable bridges, the track owner shall prepare an inspection and maintenance Guidebook for use by railroad employees which shall be submitted to the Federal Railroad Administration. The Guidebook shall contain at a minimum—


(1) Inspection frequency and methodology including limiting measurement values for all components subject to wear or requiring adjustment.


(2) Maintenance techniques.
