# ยง 214.331   Definite train location.

A roadway worker may establish on-track safety by using definite train location only where permitted by and in accordance with the following provisions:


(a) A Class I railroad or a commuter railroad may only use definite train location to establish on-track safety at points where such procedures were in use on January 15, 1997.


(b) Each Class I or commuter railroad shall include in its on-track safety program for approval by FRA in accordance with ยง 214.307 of this part a schedule for phase-out of the use of definite train location to establish on-track safety.


(c) A railroad other than a Class I or commuter railroad may use definite train location to establish on-track safety on subdivisions only where:


(1) Such procedures were in use on January 15, 1997, or


(2) The number of trains operated on the subdivision does not exceed:


(i) Three during any nine-hour period in which roadway workers are on duty, and


(ii) Four during any twelve-hour period in which roadway workers are on duty.


(d) Definite train location shall only be used to establish on-track safety according to the following provisions:


(1) Definite train location information shall be issued only by the one train dispatcher who is designated to authorize train movements over the track for which the information is provided.

A list thus canceled shall then be invalid for on-track safety.

(6) A railroad shall not permit a train to depart a location designated in a definite train location list before the time shown therein.


(7) Each roadway worker who uses definite train location to establish on-track safety must be qualified on the relevant physical characteristics of the territory for which the train location information is provided.
