# Appendix C to Part 215—FRA Freight Car Standards Defect Code


The following defect code has been established for use by FRA and State inspectors to report defects observed during inspection of freight cars. The purpose of the code is to establish a uniform language among FRA, States, and the railroad industry that will facilitate communication, recordkeeping, and statistical analyses. The code may not be substituted for the description of defects on bad order tags affixed to cars being moved for repair under § 215.9. However, it may be used to supplement that description.
