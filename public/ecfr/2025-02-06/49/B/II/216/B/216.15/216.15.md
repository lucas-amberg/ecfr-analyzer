# § 216.15   Special notice for repairs—track class.

(a) When an FRA Track Inspector or State Track Inspector determines that track does not comply with the requirements for the class at which the track is being operated, as defined in the Track Safety Standards (49 CFR part 213), he notifies the railroad in writing that the track is being lowered in class and that operations over that track must comply with the speed limitations prescribed in part 213 of this chapter. The notice describes the conditions requiring the track to be lowered in class, specifies the exact location of the affected track segment, and states the highest class and corresponding maximum speeds at which trains may be operated over that track. After receipt of such notice, the speeds at which trains operate over that track shall not exceed the stated maximum permissible speeds, until such time as the track conforms to applicable standards for a higher class.


(b) The railroad shall notify the FRA Regional Administrator in writing when the track is restored to a condition permitting operations at speeds authorized for a higher class, specifying the repairs completed.
