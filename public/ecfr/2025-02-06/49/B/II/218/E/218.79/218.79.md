# ยง 218.79   Alternative methods of protection.

Instead of providing protection for occupied camp cars in accordance with ยง 218.75 or ยง 218.77, the following methods of protection may be used:


(a) When occupied camp cars are on track other than main track:


(1) A warning signal must be displayed at or near each switch providing access to or from the track;


(2) Each switch providing entrance to or departure from the area must be lined against movement to the track and locked with an effective locking device; and


(3) If the speed within this area is restricted to not more than five miles per hour, a derail, capable of restricting access to that portion of track on which the camp cars are located, will fulfill the requirements of a manually operated switch in compliance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section when positioned at least 50 feet from the end of the camp cars to be protected by the warning signal, when locked in a derailing position with an effective locking device, and when a warning signal is displayed at the derail.


(b) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, when occupied camp cars are on track other than main track:


(1) A derail, capable of restricting access to that portion of the track on which such equipment is located, will fulfill the requirements of a manually operated switch when positioned no less than 150 feet from the end of such equipment; and


(2) Each derail must be locked in a derailing position with an effective locking device and a warning signal must be displayed at each derail.
