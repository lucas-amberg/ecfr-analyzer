# § 218.93   Definitions.

As used in this subpart—


*Clearance point* means the location near a turnout beyond which it is unsafe for passage on an adjacent track(s). Where a person is permitted by a railroad's operating rules to ride the side of a car, a clearance point shall accommodate a person riding the side of a car.


*Correspondence of crossover switches* means both crossover switches are lined for the crossover or both are lined for the straight tracks.


*Crossover* means, for purposes of this subpart only, a track connection between two adjacent, but not necessarily parallel, tracks, consisting of two switches, which is intended to be used primarily for the purpose of crossing over from one track to another.


*Departure track* means a track located in a classification yard where rolling equipment is placed and made ready for an outgoing train movement.


*Employee* means an individual who is engaged or compensated by a railroad or by a contractor to a railroad to perform any of the duties defined in this subpart.


*Foul or fouling a track* means rolling equipment or on-track maintenance-of-way equipment is located such that the end of the equipment is between the clearance point and the switch points leading to the track on which the equipment is standing.


*FRA* means the Federal Railroad Administration.


*Hand-operated switch* means any type of switch when operated by manual manipulation. For purposes of this subpart, a hand-operated switch does not include switches operated by push button or radio control when such switch is protected by distant switch indicators, switch point indicators, or other visual or audio verification that the switch points are lined for the intended route and fit properly.


*Highway-rail grade crossing* means, for purposes of this subpart only, an at-grade crossing where a public highway, road, street, or private roadway, including associated sidewalks and pathways, crosses one or more railroad tracks at grade, and is identified by a U.S. DOT National Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Inventory Number, or is marked by crossbucks, stop signs, or other appropriate signage indicating the presence of an at-grade crossing.


*Industry track* means a switching track, or series of tracks, serving the needs of a commercial industry other than a railroad.


*Locomotive* means, for purposes of this subpart only, a piece of on-track equipment (other than specialized roadway maintenance equipment or a dual purpose vehicle operating in accordance with § 240.104(a)(2) of this chapter):


(1) With one or more propelling motors designed for moving other equipment;


(2) With one or more propelling motors designed to carry freight or passenger traffic or both; or


(3) Without propelling motors but with one or more control stands.


*Pedestrian crossing* means a separate designated sidewalk or pathway where pedestrians, but not vehicles, cross railroad tracks. Sidewalk crossings contiguous with, or separate but adjacent to, highway-rail grade crossings, are presumed to be part of the highway-rail grade crossings and are *not* considered pedestrian crossings.


*Qualified* means that a person has successfully completed all instruction, training, and examination programs required by the railroad and this subpart and that the person, therefore, has actual knowledge or may reasonably be expected to have knowledge of the subject on which the person is expected to be competent.


*Remote control operator* means a locomotive engineer, as defined in § 240.7 of this chapter, certified by a railroad to operate remote control locomotives pursuant to § 240.107 of this chapter.


*Remote control zone* means one or more tracks within defined limits designated in the timetable special instructions, or other railroad publication, within which remote control locomotives, under certain circumstances specified in this part, may be operated without an employee assigned to protect the pull-out end of the remote control movement, i.e., the end on which the locomotive is located.


*Roadway maintenance activity* means any work limited to the duties prescribed for a roadway worker by definition in this section, including movement of on-track maintenance-of-way equipment other than locomotives.


*Roadway worker* means any employee of a railroad, or of a contractor to a railroad, whose duties include inspection, construction, maintenance or repair of railroad track, bridges, roadway, signal and communication systems, electric traction systems, roadway facilities or roadway maintenance machinery on or near track or with the potential of fouling a track, and flagmen and watchmen/lookouts as defined in § 214.7 of this chapter.


*Roadway worker in charge* means a roadway worker who is qualified in accordance with § 214.353 of this chapter for the purpose of establishing on-track safety for roadway work groups.


*Siding* means an auxiliary track, adjacent and connected to a main track, used for meeting or passing trains.


*Signaled siding* means a siding within traffic control system (TCS) territory or within interlocking limits where a signal indication authorizes the siding's use.


*Switchtender* means a qualified employee assigned to handle switches at a specific location.


*Track is clear* means:


(1) The portion of the track to be used for the intended movement is unoccupied by rolling equipment, on-track maintenance-of-way equipment, and conflicting on-track movements;


(2) Intervening public highway-rail grade crossings, private highway-rail grade crossings outside the physical confines of a railroad yard, pedestrian crossings outside of the physical confines of a railroad yard, and yard access crossings are protected as follows:


(i) Crossing gates are in the fully lowered position, and are not known to be malfunctioning; or


(ii) A designated and qualified employee is stationed at the crossing and has the ability to communicate with trains; or


(iii) At crossings equipped only with flashing lights or passive warning devices, when it is clearly seen that no traffic is approaching or stopped at the crossing and the leading end of the movement over the crossing does not exceed 15 miles per hour;


(3) Intervening switches and fixed derails are properly lined for the intended movement; and


(4) The portion of the track to be used for the intended movement has sufficient room to contain the rolling equipment being shoved or pushed.


*Yard access crossing* means a private highway-rail grade crossing that is located within the physical confines of a railroad yard and is either:


(1) Open to unrestricted public access; or


(2) Open to persons other than railroad employees going about their normal duties, e.g., business guests or family members.
