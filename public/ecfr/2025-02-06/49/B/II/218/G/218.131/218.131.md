# § 218.131   Special approval petition requirements for train operations staffed with a one-person train crew.

(a) *General.* With the exception of operations permitted under §§ 218.125 through 218.129, and as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section:


(1) No railroad may operate a train with a one-person train crew unless it receives special approval for the operation under this subpart.


(2) For a railroad that has established a one-person train crew operation before June 10, 2024, the railroad may continue the operation in accordance with this section pending FRA's decision on the railroad's special approval petition if:


(i) The railroad submits a written notice by email to *FRAOPCERTPROG@dot.gov* no later than June 24, 2024 that, at a minimum, provides a summary of the operation and the name, title, address, telephone number, and email address of the primary person(s) to be contacted regarding the written notice and the operation;


(ii) The railroad, in coordination with FRA, eliminates, mitigates, or otherwise addresses any safety hazards related to the one-person train crew operation FRA finds in reviewing the railroad's special approval petition; and


(iii) The railroad submits its special approval petition, as specified by the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, no later than August 7, 2024.


(3) Each freight railroad seeking to either initiate or continue a train operation with a one-person train crew must receive FRA's special approval for the operation under this subpart and shall comply with the requirements in § 218.129(c).


(4) Each passenger railroad seeking to initiate a train operation with a one-person train crew must receive FRA's special approval for the operation under this subpart and have either:


(i) An approved passenger train emergency preparedness plan under part 239 of this chapter for the operation; or


(ii) An approved waiver from the passenger train emergency preparedness plan requirements as permitted under part 211 of this chapter. A passenger railroad may petition FRA for both a waiver under part 211 and special approval for a train operation staffed with a one-person train crew in the same filing.


(b) *Petition for a train operation staffed with a one-person train crew.* Each petition for a train operation with a one-person train crew that is not permitted under §§ 218.125 through 218.129 must contain sufficient information for FRA to determine whether approving the operation described in the petition is as safe or safer than a two-person minimum train crew operation. At a minimum, a petition must include:


(1) The name, title, address, telephone number, and email address of the primary person to be contacted regarding review of the special approval petition;


(2) The location of the operation, with as much specificity as can be provided, as to the characteristics of the geographic area through which the trains will operate (*e.g.* population density and proximity to environmentally sensitive areas), the terrain over which the trains will be operated, industries or communities served, and track segments, territories, divisions, or subdivisions operated over;


(3) The class(es) of track to be operated over, the method of operation, a list of the signal and train control systems, devices, and appliances installed and in operation, and a list of all active and passive highway-rail grade crossings, including crossing numbers;


(4) The locations of any track where the average grade of any segment of the track operated over is 1 percent or more over 3 continuous miles or 2 percent or more over 2 continuous miles;


(5) The maximum authorized speed of the operation;


(6) The approximate average number of miles and hours a person is projected to operate as a train crewmember in a one-person train crew operation;


(7) The maximum number of cars and tonnage proposed for the operation, if any;


(8) Whether the railroad is seeking approval to transport hazardous materials of the types or quantities specified in § 218.123(c) or whether the railroad is seeking approval to transport other hazardous materials (as defined by § 171.8 of this title) of any quantity and type;


(9) Whether any limitations will be placed on a person operating as a one-person train crew. Such limitations may include, but are not limited to, a maximum number of miles or hours during a single tour of duty, or limitations placed on a person in coordination with a fatigue mitigation plan;


(10) Information regarding other operations that may travel on the same track as, or an adjacent track to, the train operation staffed with a one-person train crew. Such information shall include, but is not limited to, the volume of traffic and the types of opposing moves (*e.g.,* passenger or freight trains hauling hazardous materials);


(11) A detailed description of any technology that will be used to perform or support tasks typically performed by a second crewmember, or that will prevent or significantly mitigate the consequences of accidents or incidents;


(12) A copy of any railroad rule or practice that will apply to the proposed train operation(s) with a one-person train crew, but does not apply to train crew operations with two or more crewmembers;


(13) A copy of a railroad operating rule that will apply to the proposed train operation(s) with a one-person train crew, and which complies with the requirements of § 218.129(c)(1), to ensure rail employees can take mitigation measures that provide a level of safety that is as safe or safer than a two-person train crew operation to address certain situations with the one-person train crew operation. A passenger train operation with an approved emergency preparedness plan under part 239 of this chapter satisfies the requirement in this paragraph (b)(13);


(14) Five (5) years of accident and incident data, as required by part 225 of this chapter, for the operation identified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, when operating with two or more crewmembers, or, for operations established less than five (5) years before June 10, 2024, accident and incident data for the operation from the date the operation was established;


(15) A risk assessment of the proposed operation that meets the requirements of § 218.133;


(16) Any other information describing protections provided in lieu of a second train crewmember, or other relevant data or analysis.


(c) *Additional information.* FRA may request any additional information, beyond what is provided in the petition, that it deems necessary.
