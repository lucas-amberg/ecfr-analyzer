# § 219.10   Penalties.

Any person, as defined by § 219.5, who violates any requirement of this part or causes the violation of any such requirement is subject to a civil penalty of at least $1,114 and not more than $36,439 per violation, except that: Penalties may be assessed against individuals only for willful violations; where a grossly negligent violation or a pattern of repeated violations has created an imminent hazard of death or injury, or has caused death or injury, a penalty not to exceed $145,754 per violation may be assessed; and the standard of liability for a railroad will vary depending upon the requirement involved. See, *e.g.,* § 219.105, which is construed to qualify the responsibility of a railroad for the unauthorized conduct of a regulated employee that violates § 219.101 or § 219.102 (while imposing a duty of due diligence to prevent such conduct). Each day a violation continues constitutes a separate offense. See FRA's website at *www.fra.dot.gov* for a statement of agency civil penalty policy.
