# § 219.23   Railroad policies.

(a) Whenever a breath or body fluid test is required of a regulated employee under this part, the railroad (either through a railroad employee or a designated agent, such as a contracted collector) must provide clear and unequivocal written notice to the employee that the test is being required under FRA regulations and is being conducted under Federal authority. The railroad must also provide the employee clear and unequivocal written notice of the type of test that is required (*e.g.,* reasonable suspicion, reasonable cause, random selection, follow-up, etc.). These notice requirements are satisfied if:


(1) For all FRA testing except mandatory post-accident toxicological testing under subpart C of this part, a railroad uses the mandated DOT alcohol or drug testing form, circles or checks off the box corresponding to the type of test, and shows this form to the employee before testing begins; or


(2) For mandatory post-accident toxicological testing under subpart C of this part, a railroad uses the approved FRA form and shows this form to the employee before testing begins.


(b) Use of the mandated DOT alcohol or drug testing forms for non-Federal tests or mandatory post-accident toxicological testing under subpart C of this part is prohibited (except for post-accident breath alcohol testing permitted under § 219.203(c)). Use of the approved FRA post-accident toxicological testing form for any testing other than that mandated under subpart C is prohibited.


(c) Each railroad must develop and publish educational materials, specifically designed for regulated employees that clearly explain the requirements of this part, as well as the railroad's policies and procedures with respect to meeting those requirements. The railroad must ensure that a copy of these materials is distributed to each regulated employee hired for or transferred to a position that requires alcohol and drug testing under this part. (This requirement does not apply to an applicant for a regulated service position who either refuses to provide a specimen for pre-employment testing or who has a pre-employment test with a result indicating a violation of the alcohol or drug prohibitions of this part.) A railroad may satisfy this requirement by either—


(1)(i) Continually posting the materials in a location that is easily visible to all regulated employees going on duty at their designated reporting place and, if applicable, providing a copy of the materials to any employee labor organization representing a class or craft of regulated employees of the railroad; or


(ii) Providing a copy of the materials in some other manner that will ensure regulated employees can find and access these materials explaining the critical aspects of the program (*e.g.,* by posting the materials on a company Web site that is accessible to all regulated employees); or


(2) For a minimum of three years after March 4, 2022, also ensuring that a hard copy of these materials is provided to each mechanical employee.


(d) *Required content.* The materials to be made available to regulated employees under paragraph (c) of this section must, at a minimum, include clear and detailed discussion of the following:


(1) The position title, name, and means of contacting the person(s) the railroad designates to answer employee questions about the materials;


(2) The specific classes or crafts of employee who are subject to the provisions of this part, such as engineers, conductors, MOW employees, MECH employees, signal maintainers, or train dispatchers;


(3) Sufficient information about the regulated service functions those employees perform to make clear that the period of the work day the regulated employee is required to be in compliance with the alcohol prohibitions of this part is that period when the employee is on duty and is required to perform or is available to perform regulated service;


(4) Specific information concerning regulated employee conduct that is prohibited under subpart B of this part (*e.g.,* the minimum requirements of §§ 219.101, 219.102, and 219.103);


(5) The requirement that a railroad utilizing the reasonable cause testing authority provided by subpart E of this part must give prior notice to regulated employees of the circumstances under which they will be subject to reasonable cause testing;


(6) The circumstances under which a regulated employee will be tested under this part;


(7) The procedures used to test for the presence of alcohol and controlled substances, protect the regulated employee and the integrity of the testing processes, safeguard the validity of the test results, and ensure that those results are attributed to the correct employee;


(8) The requirement that a regulated employee submit to alcohol and drug tests administered in accordance with this part;


(9) An explanation of what constitutes a refusal to submit to an alcohol or drug test and the attendant consequences;


(10) The consequences for a regulated employee found to have violated subpart B of this part, including the requirement that the employee be removed immediately from regulated service, and the responsive action requirements of § 219.104;


(11) The consequences for a regulated employee who has a Federal alcohol test indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04; and


(12) Information concerning the effects of alcohol and drug misuse on an individual's health, work, and personal life; signs and symptoms of an alcohol or drug problem (the employee's or a co-worker's); and available methods of evaluating and resolving problems associated with the misuse of alcohol and drugs, and the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of DACs and counseling and treatment programs.


(e) Optional provisions. The materials supplied to employees may also include information on additional railroad policies with respect to the use or possession of alcohol and drugs, including any consequences for an employee found to have a specific alcohol concentration that are based on the railroad's company authority independent of this part. Any such additional policies or consequences must be clearly and obviously described as being based on the railroad's independent company authority.
