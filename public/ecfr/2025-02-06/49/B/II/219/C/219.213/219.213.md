(a) *Disqualification.* An employee who refuses to cooperate in providing breath, blood or urine specimens following an accident or incident specified in this subpart must be withdrawn from regulated service, and must be deemed disqualified for regulated service, for a period of nine (9) months in accordance with the conditions specified in ยง 219.107.


(b) *Procedures.* Prior to or upon withdrawing the employee from regulated service, under this section, the railroad must provide written notice of the reason for this action and an opportunity for hearing before a presiding officer other than the charging official. The employee is entitled to the procedural protection set out in ยง 219.104(d).


(c) *Subject of hearing.* The hearing required by this section must determine whether the employee refused to submit to testing, having been requested to submit, under authority of this subpart, by a representative of the railroad.

(1) Whether the railroad made a good faith determination, based on reasonable inquiry, that the accident or incident was within the mandatory testing requirements of this subpart; and


(2) In a case where a blood test was refused on the ground it would be inconsistent with the employee's health, whether such refusal was made in good faith and based on medical advice.
