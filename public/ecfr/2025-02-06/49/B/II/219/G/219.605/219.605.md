# § 219.605   Submission and approval of random testing plans.

(a) *Plan submission.* (1) Each railroad must submit for review and approval a random testing plan meeting the requirements of §§ 219.607 and 219.609 by email to *FRA-DrugAlcoholProgram.email@dot.gov.* The submission must include the name of the railroad or contractor in the subject line. A railroad commencing start-up operations must submit its plan no later than 30 days before its date of commencing operations. A railroad that must comply with this subpart because it no longer qualifies for the small railroad exception under § 219.3 (due to a change in operations or its number of covered employees) must submit its plan no later than 30 days after it becomes subject to the requirements of this subpart. A railroad may not implement a Federal random testing plan or any substantive amendment to that plan before FRA approval.


(2) A railroad may submit separate random testing plans for each category of regulated employees (as defined in § 219.5), combine all categories into a single plan, or amend its current FRA-approved plan to add additional categories of regulated employees, as defined by this part.


(b) *Plan approval notification.* FRA will notify a railroad in writing whether its plan is approved. If the plan is not approved because it does not meet the requirements of this subpart, FRA will inform the railroad of its non-approval, with specific explanations of any required revisions. The railroad must resubmit its plan with the required revisions within 30 days of the date of FRA's written notice. Failure to resubmit the plan with the necessary revisions will be a failure to submit a plan under this part.


(c) *Plan implementation.* Each railroad must implement its random testing plan no later than 30 days from the date of FRA approval.


(d) *Plan amendments.* (1) Each railroad must submit to FRA a substantive amendment to an approved plan at least 30 days before its intended effective date. A railroad may not implement any substantive amendment before FRA approval.


(2) Each railroad must provide a non-substantive amendment to an approved plan (such as the replacement or addition of service providers) to the FRA Drug and Alcohol Program Manager in writing (by letter or email) before its effective date. However, FRA pre-approval is not required.


(e) *Previously approved plans.* A railroad is not required to resubmit a random testing plan that FRA had approved before March 4, 2022, unless the railroad must amend the plan to comply with the requirements of this subpart. A railroad must submit new plans, combined plans, or amended plans incorporating new categories of regulated employees (*i.e.,* mechanical employees) for FRA approval at least 60 days after March 4, 2022.
