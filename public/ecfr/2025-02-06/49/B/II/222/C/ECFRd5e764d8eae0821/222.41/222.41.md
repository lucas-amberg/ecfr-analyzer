(ii) The Quiet Zone Risk Index is at, or below, the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, as last published by FRA in the _Federal Register_; or


(iii) The Quiet Zone Risk Index is above the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold, as last published by FRA in the _Federal Register,_ but less than twice the Nationwide Significant Risk Threshold and there have been no relevant collisions at any public highway-rail grade crossing within the quiet zone since April 27, 2000 or


(iv) The Quiet Zone Risk Index is at, or below, the Risk Index with Horns.


(2) The public authority shall provide Notice of Quiet Zone Establishment, in accordance with § 222.43 of this part, no later than December 24, 2005.


(b) *Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zones that will be established by automatic approval.* (1) A Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone may be established by automatic approval and remain in effect, subject to § 222.51, if the Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone is in compliance with §§ 222.35 (minimum requirements for quiet zones) and 222.43 of this part (notice and information requirements) and:

(iv) The Quiet Zone Risk Index is at, or below, the Risk Index with Horns.


(2) The public authority shall provide Notice of Quiet Zone Establishment, in accordance with § 222.43 of this part, no later than December 24, 2005.


(c) *Pre-Rule Quiet Zones and Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zones that will not be established by automatic approval.* (1) If a Pre-Rule Quiet Zone or Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone will not be established by automatic approval under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, existing restrictions may, at the public authority's discretion, remain in place until June 24, 2008, if a Notice of Quiet Zone Continuation is provided in accordance with § 222.43 of this part.

(B) A detailed plan for quiet zone improvements is filed with the Associate Administrator by June 24, 2008. The detailed plan shall include a detailed explanation of, and timetable for, the safety improvements that will be implemented at each public, private and pedestrian grade crossing located within the Pre-Rule Quiet Zone or Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone which are necessary to comply with §§ 222.25, 222.27, 222.35 and 222.39 of this part.


(ii) In the event that the safety improvements planned for the quiet zone require approval of FRA under § 222.39(b) of this part, the public authority should apply for such approval prior to December 24, 2007, to ensure that FRA has ample time in which to review such application prior to the end of the extension period.

(i) Prior to June 24, 2008, the appropriate State agency provides to the Associate Administrator: A comprehensive State-wide implementation plan and funding commitment for implementing improvements at Pre-Rule Quiet Zones and Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zones which, when implemented, would enable them to qualify as quiet zones under this part; and


(ii) Prior to June 24, 2009, either safety improvements are initiated at a portion of the crossings within the quiet zone, or the appropriate State agency has participated in quiet zone improvements in one or more Pre-Rule Quiet Zones or Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zones elsewhere within the State.


(4) A public authority may establish a Pre-Rule Quiet Zone or Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone upon compliance with:


(A) The Pre-Rule Quiet Zone or Pre-Rule Partial Quiet Zone requirements contained within §§ 222.25, 222.27, and 222.35 of this part;
