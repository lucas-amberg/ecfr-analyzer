At a minimum, “establishment” posting is required and shall include locations where a railroad reasonably expects its employees to report during a 12-month period and to have the opportunity to observe the posted list containing any reportable injuries or illnesses they have suffered during the applicable period. This listing shall be posted and shall remain continuously displayed for the next twelve consecutive months. Incidents reported for employees at that establishment shall be displayed in date sequence.

(i) *Claimed occupational illnesses.* (1) Each railroad may maintain a Form FRA F 6180.107, “Alternative Records for Illnesses Claimed to be Work-Related,” or an alternate railroad-designed record as described in paragraph (j) of this section, in place of Form FRA F 6180.98, “Railroad Employee Injury and/or Illness Record,” only for those claimed occupational illnesses for which the railroad has not received information sufficient to determine whether the occupational illness is work-related.


(2) Each railroad shall enter each illness claimed to be work-related on the appropriate record, as required by paragraph (i)(1) of this section, as early as practicable, but no later than seven working days after receiving information or acquiring knowledge that an employee is claiming they have incurred an occupational illness.


(3) When a railroad does not receive information sufficient to determine whether a claimed occupational illness case is accountable or reportable, the railroad shall make a good faith effort to obtain the necessary information by December 1 of the next calendar year.

(6) For any claimed occupational illness case determined to be accountable or reportable, each railroad shall:


(i) Complete a Form FRA F 6180.98, “Railroad Employee Injury and/or Illness Record” or alternative railroad-designed form within seven days of making such determination;


(ii) Retain the Form FRA F 6180.98, “Railroad Employee Injury and/or Illness Record,” in accordance with § 225.27; and

(i) Why the case does not meet reporting criteria;


(ii) The basis upon which the railroad made this determination; and


(iii) The most authoritative information the railroad relied upon to make the determination.


(8) Although Form FRA 6180.107, “Alternative Record for Illnesses Claimed to be Work-Related” (or the alternate railroad-designed form), may not include all supporting documentation, such as medical records, the alternative record shall note the custodian of those documents and where the supporting documents are located so that they are readily accessible to FRA upon request.


(j) An alternative railroad-designed record may be used in lieu of the Form FRA F 6180.107, “Alternative Record for Illnesses Claimed to be Work-Related.” Any such alternative record shall contain all of the information required on the Form FRA F 6180.107. Although this information may be displayed in a different order from that on Form FRA F 6180.107, the order of the information shall be consistent from one such record to another such record. The order chosen by the railroad shall be consistent for all of the railroad's reporting establishments.

The alternative record shall contain, at a minimum, the following information:
