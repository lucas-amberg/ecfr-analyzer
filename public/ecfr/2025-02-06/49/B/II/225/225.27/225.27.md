No two persons shall have the same electronic identity;


(ii) The electronic system shall ensure that each record cannot be modified, or replaced, once the record is submitted to FRA;


(iii) Any amendment to a record shall be electronically stored apart from the record which it amends. Each amendment to a record shall uniquely identify the person making the amendment and the date the amendment was made;


(iv) The electronic system shall provide for the maintenance of reports as originally submitted to FRA without corruption or loss of data; and

(2) *Accessibility and availability.* Any electronic record system used to create, maintain, or transfer a record required to be maintained by this part shall meet the following access and availability parameters:


(i) Paper copies of electronic records and amendments to those records that may be necessary to document compliance with this part shall be provided to any representative of the FRA or of a State agency participating in investigative and/or surveillance activities under part 212 of this chapter or any other authorized representative for inspection and photocopying upon request in accordance with § 225.35; and


(ii) Paper copies provided to FRA or of a State agency participating in investigative and/or surveillance activities under part 212 of this chapter or any other authorized representative shall be produced in a readable text format and all data shall be identified by narrative descriptions (*e.g.,* “accident/incident number,” “number of days away from work,” “date of occurrence,” *etc.*).
