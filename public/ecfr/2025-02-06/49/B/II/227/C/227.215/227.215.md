# ยง 227.215   Recordkeeping in general.

(a) *Availability of records.* (1) A railroad shall make all records required by this subpart available for inspection and copying or photocopying to representatives of FRA, upon request.


(2) Except for records of pre-trip inspections of EEBAs under ยง 227.207, records required to be retained under this subpart must be kept at the system headquarters and at each division headquarters where the tests and inspections are conducted.


(b) *Electronic records.* All records required by this subpart may be kept in electronic form by the railroad. A railroad may maintain and transfer records through electronic transmission, storage, and retrieval provided that all of the following conditions are met:


(1) The electronic system is designed so that the integrity of each record is maintained through appropriate levels of security such as recognition of an electronic signature, or other means, which uniquely identify the initiating person as the author of that record. No two persons have the same electronic identity.


(2) The electronic system ensures that each record cannot be modified in any way, or replaced, once the record is transmitted and stored.


(3) Any amendment to a record is electronically stored apart from the record that it amends. Each amendment to a record is uniquely identified as to the individual making the amendment.


(4) The electronic system provides for the maintenance of records as originally submitted without corruption or loss of data.


(5) Paper copies of electronic records and amendments to those records that may be necessary to document compliance with this subpart are made available for inspection and copying or photocopying by representatives of FRA.
