(2) Natural or other barriers exist or will be created prior to occupancy of the proposed facility between the proposed site and any areas in which switching or humping operations are performed which will be adequate to shield the facility from the direct and severe effects of a hazardous materials accident/incident arising in an area of switching or humping operations;
