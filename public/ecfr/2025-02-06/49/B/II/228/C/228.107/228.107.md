# § 228.107   Action on petition.

(a) Each petition for approval filed under § 228.103 is referred to the Railroad Safety Board for action in accordance with the provisions of part 211, title 49, CFR, concerning the processing of requests for special approvals.


(b) In considering a petition for approval filed under this subpart, the Railroad Safety Board evaluates the material factors bearing on—


(1) The safety of employees utilizing the proposed facility in the event of a hazardous materials accident/incident and in light of other relevant safety factors; and


(2) Interior noise levels in the facility.

If individual air conditioning and heating systems are to be utilized, projections may relate to noise levels with such units turned off.
