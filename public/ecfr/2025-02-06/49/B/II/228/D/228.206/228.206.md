# § 228.206   Requirements for automated records and for automated recordkeeping systems on eligible smaller railroads, and their contractors or subcontractors that provide covered service employees to such railroads.

(a) *Use of electronic signature.* Each employee creating a record required by subpart B of this part must sign the record using an electronic signature that meets the following requirements:


(1) The record contains the printed name of the signer and the date and actual time the signature was executed, and the meaning (such as authorship, review, or approval) associated with the signature;


(2) Each electronic signature is unique to one individual and shall not be used by, or assigned to, anyone else;


(3) Before an eligible smaller railroad, or a contractor or subcontractor to such a railroad, establishes, assigns, certifies, or otherwise sanctions an individual's electronic signature, or any element of such electronic signature, the organization shall verify the identity of the individual;


(4) A person using an electronic signature shall, prior to or at the time of each such use, certify to FRA that the person's electronic signature in the system, used on or after August 29, 2018 is the legally binding equivalent of the person's traditional handwritten signature;


(5) Each employee shall sign the initial certification of his or her electronic signature with a traditional handwritten signature, and each railroad using an automated system shall maintain certification of each electronic signature at its headquarters or the headquarters of any contractor or subcontractor providing employees who perform covered service to such a railroad, and railroads, contractors, and subcontractors must make the certification available to FRA upon request; and


(6) A person using an electronic signature in such a system shall, upon FRA request, provide additional certification or testimony that a specific electronic signature is the legally binding equivalent of his or her handwritten signature.


(b) *System security.* Railroads using an automated recordkeeping system must protect the integrity of the system by the use of an employee identification number and password, or a comparable method, to establish appropriate levels of program access meeting all of the following standards:


(1) Data input is restricted to the employee or train crew or signal gang whose time is being recorded, except that an eligible smaller railroad, or a contractor or subcontractor to such a railroad, may pre-populate fields of the hours of service record provided that—


(i) The eligible smaller railroad, or its contractor or subcontractor, pre-populates fields of the hours of service record with information the railroad, or its contractor or subcontractor knows is factually accurate for a specific employee.


(ii) The recordkeeping system may allow employees to copy data from one field of a record into another field, where applicable.


(iii) The eligible smaller railroad, or its contractor or subcontractor does not use estimated, historical, or arbitrary information to pre-populate any field of an hours of service record.


(iv) An eligible smaller railroad, or a contractor or a subcontractor to such a railroad, is not in violation of paragraph (b)(1) of this section if it makes a good faith judgment as to the factual accuracy of the data for a specific employee but nevertheless errs in pre-populating a data field.


(v) The employee may make any necessary changes to the data by typing into the field without having to access another screen or obtain clearance from railroad, or contractor or subcontractor to the railroad.


(2) No two individuals have the same electronic signature.


(3) No individual can delete or alter a record after the employee who created the record electronically signs the record.


(4) Any amendment to a record is either:


(i) Electronically stored apart from the record that it amends; or


(ii) Electronically attached to the record as information without changing the original record.


(5) Each amendment to a record uniquely identifies the individual making the amendment.


(6) The automated system maintains the records as originally submitted without corruption or loss of data. Beginning August 29, 2018, an eligible smaller railroad must retain back-up data storage for its automated records for the quarters prescribed in the following table for the time specified in § 228.9(c)(3), to be updated within 30 days of the end of each prescribed quarter—


(7) Supervisors and crew management officials can access, but cannot delete or alter, the records of any employee after the employee electronically signs the record.


(c) *Identification of the individual entering data.* If a given record contains data entered by more than one individual, the record must identify each individual who entered specific information within the record and the data the individual entered.


(d) *Search capabilities.* The automated recordkeeping system must store records using the following criteria so all records matching the selected criteria are retrieved from the same location:


(1) Date (month and year);


(2) Employee name or identification number; and


(3) Electronically signed records containing one or more instances of excess service, including duty tours in excess of 12 hours.


(e) *Access to records.* An eligible smaller railroad, or contractor or subcontractor providing covered service employees to such a railroad, must provide access to its hours of service records under subpart B that are created and maintained in its automated recordkeeping system to FRA inspectors and State inspectors participating under 49 CFR part 212, subject to the following requirements:


(1) Access to records created and maintained in the automated recordkeeping system must be obtained as required by § 228.9(c)(4);


(2) An eligible smaller railroad must establish and comply with procedures for providing an FRA inspector or participating State inspector with access to the system upon request and must provide access to the system as soon as possible but not later than 24 hours after a request for access;


(3) Each data field entered by an employee on the input screen must be visible to the FRA inspector or participating State inspector; and


(4) The data fields must be searchable as described in paragraph (d) of this section and must yield access to all records matching the criteria specified in a search.
