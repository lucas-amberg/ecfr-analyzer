# § 229.20   Electronic recordkeeping.

(a) For purposes of compliance with the recordkeeping requirements of this part, except for the daily inspection record maintained on the locomotive required by § 229.21, the cab copy of Form FRA F 6180-49-A required by § 229.23, the fragmented air brake maintenance record required by § 229.27, and records required under § 229.9, a railroad may create, maintain, and transfer any of the records required by this part through electronic transmission, storage, and retrieval provided that all of the requirements contained in this section are met.


(b) *Design requirements.* Any electronic record system used to create, maintain, or transfer a record required to be maintained by this part shall meet the following design requirements:


(1) The electronic record system shall be designed such that the integrity of each record is maintained through appropriate levels of security such as recognition of an electronic signature, or other means, which uniquely identify the initiating person as the author of that record. No two persons shall have the same electronic identity;


(2) The electronic system shall ensure that each record cannot be modified, or replaced, once the record is transmitted;


(3) Any amendment to a record shall be electronically stored apart from the record which it amends. Each amendment to a record shall uniquely identify the person making the amendment;


(4) The electronic system shall provide for the maintenance of inspection records as originally submitted without corruption or loss of data; and


(5) Policies and procedures shall be in place to prevent persons from altering electronic records, or otherwise interfering with the electronic system.


(c) *Operational requirements.* Any electronic record system used to create, maintain, or transfer a record required to be maintained by this part shall meet the following operating requirements:


(1) The electronic storage of any record required by this part shall be initiated by the person performing the activity to which the record pertains within 24 hours following the completion of the activity; and


(2) For each locomotive for which records of inspection or maintenance required by this part are maintained electronically, the electronic record system shall automatically notify the railroad each time the locomotive is due for an inspection, or maintenance that the electronic system is tracking. The automatic notification tracking requirement does not apply to daily inspections.


(d) *Accessibility and availability requirements.* Any electronic record system used to create, maintain, or transfer a record required to be maintained by this part shall meet the following access and availability requirements:


(1) Except as provided in § 229.313(c)(2), the carrier shall provide FRA with all electronic records maintained for compliance with this part for any specific locomotives at any mechanical department terminal upon request;


(2) Paper copies of electronic records and amendments to those records that may be necessary to document compliance with this part, shall be provided to FRA for inspection and copying upon request. Paper copies shall be provided to FRA no later than 15 days from the date the request is made; and,


(3) Inspection records required by this part shall be available to persons who performed the inspection and to persons performing subsequent inspections on the same locomotive.
