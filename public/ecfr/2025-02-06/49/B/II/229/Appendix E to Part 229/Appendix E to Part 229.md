# Appendix E to Part 229—Performance Criteria for Locomotive Crashworthiness 


This appendix provides performance criteria for the crashworthiness evaluation of alternative locomotive designs, and design standards for wide-nosed locomotives and any for other locomotive, except monocoque/semi-monocoque design locomotives and narrow-nose design locomotives. Each of the following criteria describes a collision scenario and a given performance measure for protection provided to cab occupants, normally through structural design. Demonstration that these performance criteria have been satisfied may be accomplished through any of the methods described in § 229.205. This performance criteria is intended to prevent intrusion into the cab seating area occupied by crews. This excludes inner and outer vestibule areas.


(a) *Front end structure (collision posts)*—(1) *Objective.* The front end structure of the locomotive must withstand a frontal impact with a proxy object which is intended to simulate lading carried by a heavy highway vehicle (see figure 1).


(2) *Proxy object characteristics and orientation.* The proxy object must have the following characteristics: Cylindrical shape; 48-inch diameter; 126-inch length; 65,000 pound minimum weight; and uniform density. The longitudinal axis of the proxy object must be oriented horizontally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the locomotive.


(3) *Impact and result.* The front end structure of the locomotive must withstand a 30-mph impact with the proxy object resulting in no more than 24 inches of crush along the longitudinal axis of the locomotive, measured from the foremost point on the collision post, and with no more than 12 inches of intrusion into the cab. The center of impact must be 30 inches above the top of the locomotive underframe along the longitudinal centerline of the locomotive.


(b) *Front end structure (short hood)* (1) *Objective.* The front end structure of the locomotive must withstand an oblique impact with a proxy object intended to simulate an intermodal container offset from a freight car on an adjacent parallel track (see figure 2).


(2) *Proxy object characteristics and orientation.* The proxy object must have the following characteristics: Block shape; 36-inch width; 60-inch height; 108-inch length; corners having 3-inch radii corners; 65,000 pound minimum weight; and uniform density. The longitudinal axis of the proxy object must be oriented parallel to the longitudinal axis of the locomotive. At impact, the proxy object must be oriented such that there are 12 inches of lateral overlap and 30 inches from the bottom of the proxy object to the top of the locomotive underframe.


(3) *Impact and results.* The front end structure of the locomotive must withstand a 30-mph impact with the proxy object resulting in no more than 60 inches of crush along the longitudinal axis of the locomotive, measured from the first point of contact on the short hood post, and with no more than 12 inches of intrusion into the cab.
