# § 229.121   Locomotive cab noise.

(a) *Performance standards for locomotives.* (1) When tested for static noise in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, all locomotives of each design or model that are manufactured after October 29, 2007, shall average less than or equal to 85 dB(A), with an upper 99% confidence limit of 87 dB(A). The railroad may rely on certification from the equipment manufacturer for a production run that this standard is met. The manufacturer may determine the average by testing a representative sample of locomotives or an initial series of locomotives, provided that there are suitable manufacturing quality controls and verification procedures in place to ensure product consistency.


(2) In the maintenance of locomotives that are manufactured in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a railroad shall not make any alterations that cause the average sound level for that locomotive design or model to exceed:


(i) 82 dB(A) if the average sound level for a locomotive design or model is less than 82 dB(A); or


(ii) 85 dB(A) if the average sound level for a locomotive design or model is 82 dB(A) to 85 dB(A), inclusive,


(3) The railroad or manufacturer shall follow the static test protocols set forth in appendix H of this part to determine compliance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section; and, to the extent reasonably necessary to evaluate the effect of alterations during maintenance, to determine compliance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.


(b) *Maintenance of locomotives.* (1) If a railroad receives an excessive noise report, and if the condition giving rise to the noise is not required to be immediately corrected under part 229, the railroad shall maintain a record of the report, and repair or replace the item identified as substantially contributing to the noise:


(i) On or before the next periodic inspection required by § 229.23; or


(ii) If the railroad determines that the repair or replacement of the item requires significant shop or material resources that are not readily available, at the time of the next major equipment repair commonly used for the particular type of maintenance needed.


(2) Conditions that may lead a locomotive cab occupant to file an excessive noise report include, but are not limited to: defective cab window seals; defective cab door seals; broken or inoperative windows; deteriorated insulation or insulation that has been removed for other reasons; broken or inoperative doors; and air brakes that vent inside of the cab.


(3) A railroad has an obligation to respond to an excessive noise report that a locomotive cab occupant files. The railroad meets its obligation to respond to an excessive noise report, as set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if the railroad makes a good faith effort to identify the cause of the reported noise, and where the railroad is successful in determining the cause, if the railroad repairs or replaces the items cause the noise.


(4) *Recordkeeping.* (i) A railroad shall maintain a written or electronic record of any excessive noise report, inspection, test, maintenance, replacement, or repair completed pursuant to § 229.121(b) and the date on which that inspection, test, maintenance, replacement, or repair occurred. If a railroad elects to maintain an electronic record, the railroad must satisfy the conditions listed in § 227.121(a)(2)(i) through (v).


(ii) The railroad shall retain these records for 92 days if they are made pursuant to § 229.21, or for one year if they are made pursuant to § 229.23.


(iii) The railroad shall establish an internal, auditable, monitorable system that contains these records.
