# ยง 229.127   Cab lights.

(a) Each locomotive shall have cab lights which will provide sufficient illumination for the control instruments, meters, and gauges to enable the engine crew to make accurate readings from their normal positions in the cab. These lights shall be located, constructed, and maintained so that light shines only on those parts requiring illumination and does not interfere with the crew's vision of the track and signals. Each controlling locomotive shall also have a conveniently located light that can be readily turned on and off by the persons operating the locomotive and that provides sufficient illumination for them to read train orders and timetables.


(b) Cab passageways and compartments shall have adequate illumination.
