(a) *General.* The following procedures govern consideration and action upon requests for FRA approval of new locomotive crashworthiness design standards and changes to existing FRA-approved locomotive crashworthiness design standards, including AAR S-580 (incorporated by reference, see § 229.205). Only a standards body which has adopted an FRA-approved locomotive crashworthiness design standard may initiate these procedures for FRA approval of changes to the standard.


(b) *Petitions for FRA approval of new locomotive crashworthiness design standards.* Each petition for FRA approval of a locomotive crashworthiness design standard must be titled “Petition for FRA Approval of a New Locomotive Crashworthiness Design Standard,” must be submitted to the Associate Administrator for Safety, Federal Railroad Administration, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Mail Stop 25, Washington, DC 20590, and must contain the following:


(1) The name, title, address, telephone number and e-mail address of the primary person to be contacted with regard to review of the petition;


(2) The proposed locomotive design standard, in detail;


(3) The intended type of service for locomotives designed under the proposed standard; and


(4) Appropriate data and analysis showing how the proposed design standard either satisfies the requirements of § 229.205 for the type of locomotive design or provides at least an equivalent level of safety. Types of data and analysis to be considered are described in § 229.211(c)(1).


(c) *Petitions for FRA approval of substantive changes to an FRA-approved locomotive crashworthiness design standard.* Each petition for approval of a substantive change to an FRA-approved locomotive crashworthiness design standard must be titled “Petition for FRA Approval of Changes to a Locomotive Crashworthiness Design Standard,” must be submitted to the Associate Administrator for Safety, Federal Railroad Administration, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Mail Stop 25, Washington, DC 20590, and must contain the following:

(2) The proposed change, in detail;


(3) The intended type of service for locomotives built with the proposed change; and


(4) Appropriate data and analysis showing how the resulting standard either satisfies the requirements for the type of locomotive set forth in § 229.205 or provides at least an equivalent level of safety. Types of data and analysis to be considered are described in § 229.211(c)(1).


(d) *Petitions for FRA approval of non-substantive changes to the existing FRA-approved crashworthiness design standards.* (1) Each petition for approval of a non-substantive change to an FRA-approved locomotive crashworthiness design standard must be titled “Petition for FRA Approval of Non-substantive Changes to a Locomotive Crashworthiness Design Standard,” must be submitted to the Associate Administrator for Safety, Federal Railroad Administration, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Mail Stop 25, Washington, DC 20590, and must contain the following:


(i) The name, title, address, telephone number and e-mail address of the primary person to be contacted with regard to review of the petition;


(ii) The proposed change, in detail; and


(iii) Detailed explanation of how the proposed change results in a non-substantive change to the existing FRA-approved crashworthiness design standard.
