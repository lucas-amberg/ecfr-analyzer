(a) *Number and capacity.* Every boiler shall be equipped with at least two safety relief valves, suitable for the service intended, that are capable of preventing an accumulation of pressure greater than 6 percent above the MAWP under any conditions of service. An FRA inspector may require verification of sufficient safety valve relieving capacity.


(b) *Determination of capacity.* Safety relief valve capacity may be determined by making an accumulation test with the fire in good, bright condition and all steam outlets closed. Additional safety relief valve capacity shall be provided if the safety relief valves allow an excess pressure of more than 6 percent above the MAWP during this test.
