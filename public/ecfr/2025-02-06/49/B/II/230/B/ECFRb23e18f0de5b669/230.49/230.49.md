# ยง 230.49   Setting of safety relief valves.

(a) *Qualifications of individual who adjusts.* Safety relief valves shall be set and adjusted by a competent person who is thoroughly familiar with the construction and operation of the valve being set.


(b) *Opening pressures.* At least one safety relief valve shall be set to open at a pressure not exceeding the MAWP. Safety relief valves shall be set to open at pressures not exceeding 6 psi above the MAWP.


(c) *Setting procedures.* When setting safety relief valves, two steam gauges shall be used, one of which must be so located that it will be in full view of the persons engaged in setting such valves; and if the pressure indicated by the gauges varies more than 3 psi they shall be removed from the boiler, tested, and corrected before the safety relief valves are set. Gauges shall in all cases be tested immediately before the safety relief valves are set or any change made in the setting. When setting safety relief valves, the water level shall not be higher than 
3/4 of the length of the visible water glass, as measured from the bottom of the glass.


(d) *Labeling of lowest set pressure.* The set pressure of the lowest safety relief valve shall be indicated on a tag or label attached to the steam gauge so that it may be clearly read while observing the steam gauge.
