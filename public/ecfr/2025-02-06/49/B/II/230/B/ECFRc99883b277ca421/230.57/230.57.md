(a) *Water delivery systems required.* Each steam locomotive must be equipped with at least two means of delivering water to the boiler, at least one of which is a live steam injector.


(b) *Maintenance and testing.* Injectors and feedwater pumps must be kept in good condition, free from scale, and must be tested at the beginning of each day the locomotive is used, and as often as conditions require, to ensure that they are delivering water to the boiler. Boiler checks, delivery pipes, feed water pipes, tank hose and tank valves must be kept in good condition, free from leaks and from foreign substances that would obstruct the flow of water.


(c) *Bracing.* Injectors, feedwater pumps, and all associated piping shall be securely braced so as to minimize vibration.
