(3) *Location.* One on pilot, buffer-beam; one on rear end of tender, extending across front end of locomotive and rear end of tender. Ends of handholds shall be not more than 6 inches from ends of buffer-beam or end sill, securely fastened at ends.


(4) *Manner of application.* End handholds shall be securely fastened with bolts or rivets.


(d) *Side handholds*—(1) *Number.* Four.


(2) *Dimensions.* Minimum diameter, seven-eighths of an inch, wrought iron or steel. Clear length equal to approximate height of tank. Minimum clearance, 2, preferably 2
1/2 inches.


(3) *Location.* Vertical. One on each side of tender near front corner; one on each side of locomotive at gangway.


(4) *Manner of application.* Side handholds shall be securely fastened with bolts or rivets.


(e) *Uncoupling levers*—(1) *Number.* Two double levers, operative from either side.


(2) *Dimensions.* (i) Handles of front-end levers shall be not more than 12, preferably 9, inches from ends of buffer-beam, and shall be so constructed as to give a minimum clearance of 2 inches around handle.


(ii) Rear-end levers shall extend across end of tender with handles not more than 12, preferably 9, inches from side of tender, with a guard bent on handle to give not less than 2 inches clearance around handle.


(3) *Location.* One on rear end of tender and one on front end of locomotive.


(f) *Handrails and steps for headlights.* Switching locomotives with sloping tenders with manhole or headlight located on sloping portion of tender shall be equipped with secure steps and handrail or with platform and handrail leading to such manhole or headlight.


(g) *End-ladder clearance.* No part of locomotive or tender except draft rigging, coupler and attachments, safety chains, buffer block, footboard, brake pipe, signal pipe, steam-heat pipe or arms of uncoupling lever shall extend to within 14 inches of a vertical plane passing through the inside face of knuckle when closed with horn of coupler against buffer block or end sill.
