(1) The total weight and length of the train, based on the best information available to the railroad; 


(2) Any special weight distribution that would require special train handling procedures; 


(3) The number and location of cars with cut-out or otherwise inoperative brakes and the location where they will be repaired; 


(4) If a Class I or Class IA brake test is required prior to the next crew change point, the location at which that test shall be performed; and
