# § 232.409   Inspection and testing of end-of-train devices.

(a) After each installation of either the front or rear unit of an end-of-train device, or both, on a train and before the train departs, the railroad shall determine that the identification code entered into the front unit is identical to the unique identification code on the rear unit. 


(b) After each installation of either the front or rear unit of an end-of-train device, or both, on a train and before the train departs, the functional capability of the device shall be determined, after charging the train, by comparing the quantitative value of the air pressure displayed on the front unit with the quantitative value of the air pressure displayed on the rear unit or on a properly calibrated air gauge. The end-of-train device shall not be used if the difference between the two readings exceeds three pounds per square inch. 


(c) A two-way end-of-train device shall be tested at the initial terminal or other point of installation to determine that the device is capable of initiating an emergency power brake application from the rear of the train. If this test is conducted by a person other than a member of the train crew, the locomotive engineer shall be notified that a successful test was performed. The notification required by this paragraph may be provided to the locomotive engineer by any means determined appropriate by the railroad; however, a written or electronic record of the notification shall be maintained in the cab of the controlling locomotive and shall include the date and time of the test, the location where the test was performed, and the name of the person conducting the test. 


(d) The telemetry equipment must be tested for accuracy and calibrated if necessary according to the manufacturer's specifications and procedures. If the manufacturer's specifications requires periodic calibration of the telemetry equipment, the date and location of the last calibration or test and the name or unique employee identifier of the person performing the calibration or test must be legibly displayed on a weather-resistant sticker affixed to the outside of both the front unit and the rear unit; however, if the front unit is an integral part of the locomotive or is inaccessible, then the information may be recorded on Form FRA F6180-49A instead, provided that the serial number of the unit is recorded.


(e) The air pressure sensor contained in the end-of-train device must be tested by the processes and frequency identified in § 229.27 or by manufacturer specifications approved under § 232.307. The date and location of the test and the name or unique employee identifier of the person performing the test must be legibly displayed on a weather-resistant marking device affixed to the outside of the unit.


(f) Each manufacturer of telemetry transceiver equipment must either:


(1) Establish and communicate publicly to its customers a reasonable recommended calibration period; or


(2) Submit to FRA an annual report including:


(i) The total number of transceivers—itemized by model name, number, or type—sold to date;


(ii) The number of transceivers that have been reported as inoperative or otherwise malfunctioning or returned for servicing; and


(iii) The number of transceivers reported or returned for service with frequency modulation or transmit power outside of either manufacturer's specifications or FCC-approved specifications.
