These records must show the name of the railroad, place and date, equipment tested, results of tests, repairs, replacements, adjustments made, and condition in which the apparatus was left. Each record must be:


(1) Signed by the employee making the test, or electronically coded or identified by number of the automated test equipment (where applicable);


(2) Unless otherwise noted, filed in the office of a supervisory official having jurisdiction; and


(3) Available for inspection and replication by FRA and FRA-certified State inspectors.


(b) Results of tests made in compliance with § 236.587 must be retained for 92 days.


(c) Results of tests made in compliance with § 236.917(a) must be retained as follows:


(1) Results of tests that pertain to installation or modification must be retained for the life-cycle of the equipment tested and may be kept in any office designated by the railroad; and


(2) Results of periodic tests required for maintenance or repair of the equipment tested must be retained until the next record is filed but in no case less than one year.


(d) Results of all other tests listed in this section must be retained until the next record is filed but in no case less than one year.


(e) Electronic or automated tracking systems used to meet the requirements contained in paragraph (a) of this section must be capable of being reviewed and monitored by FRA at any time to ensure the integrity of the system. FRA's Associate Administrator for Safety may prohibit or revoke a railroad's authority to utilize an electronic or automated tracking system in lieu of preprinted forms if FRA finds that the electronic or automated tracking system is not properly secured, is inaccessible to FRA, FRA-certified State inspectors, or railroad employees requiring access to discharge their assigned duties, or fails to adequately track and monitor the equipment. The Associate Administrator for Safety will provide the affected railroad with a written statement of the basis for his or her decision prohibiting or revoking the railroad from utilizing an electronic or automated tracking system.
