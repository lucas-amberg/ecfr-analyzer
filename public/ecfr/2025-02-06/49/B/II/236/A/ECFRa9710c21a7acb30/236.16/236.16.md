# ยง 236.16   Electric lock, main track releasing circuit.

When an electric lock releasing circuit is provided on the main track to permit a train or an engine to diverge from the main track without time delay, the circuit shall be of such length to permit occupancy of the circuit to be seen by a crew member stationed at the switch. When the releasing circuit extends into the fouling circuit, a train or engine on the siding shall be prevented from occupying the releasing circuit by a derail either pipe-connected to switch point or equipped with an independently operated electric lock.
