# § 236.204   Track signaled for movements in both directions, requirements.

On track signaled for movements in both directions, a train shall cause one or more opposing signals immediately ahead of it to display the most restrictive aspect, the indication of which shall be not more favorable than “proceed at restricted speed.” Signals shall be so arranged and controlled that if opposing trains can simultaneously pass signals displaying proceed aspects and the next signal in advance of each such signal then displays an aspect requiring a stop, or its most restrictive aspect, the distance between opposing signals displaying such aspects shall be not less than the aggregate of the stopping distances for movements in each direction. Where such opposing signals are spaced stopping distance apart for movements in one direction only, signals arranged to display restrictive aspects shall be provided in approach to at least one of the signals. Where such opposing signals are spaced less than stopping distance apart for movements in one direction, signals arranged to display restrictive aspects shall be provided in approach to both such signals. In absolute permissive block signaling, when a train passes a head block signal, it shall cause the opposing head block signal to display an aspect with an indication not more favorable than “stop.”
