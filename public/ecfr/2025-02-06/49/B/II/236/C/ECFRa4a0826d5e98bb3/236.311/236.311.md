# § 236.311   Signal control circuits, selection through track relays or devices functioning as track relays and through signal mechanism contacts and time releases at automatic interlocking.

(a) The control circuits for aspects with indications more favorable than “proceed at restricted speed” shall be selected through track relays, or through devices that function as track relays, for all track circuits in the route governed.


(b) At automatic interlocking, signal control circuits shall be selected (1) through track relays, or devices that function as track relays, for all track circuits in the route governed and in all conflicting routes within the interlocking; (2) through signal mechanism contacts or relay contacts closed when signals for such conflicting routes display “stop” aspects; and (3) through normal contacts of time releases, time element relays, or timing devices for such conflicting routes, or contacts of relays repeating the normal position or normal state of such time releases, time element relays, or timing devices.
