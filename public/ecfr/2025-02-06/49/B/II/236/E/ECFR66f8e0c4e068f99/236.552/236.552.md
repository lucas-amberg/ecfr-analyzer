# ยง 236.552   Insulation resistance; requirement.

When periodic test prescribed in ยง 236.588 is performed, insulation resistance between wiring and ground of continuous inductive automatic cab signal system, automatic train control system, or automatic train stop system shall be not less than one megohm, and that of an intermittent inductive automatic train stop system, not less than 250,000 ohms. Insulation resistance values between periodic tests shall be not less than 250,000 ohms for a continuous inductive automatic cab signal system, automatic train control system, or automatic train stop system, and 20,000 ohms for an intermittent inductive automatic train stop system.
