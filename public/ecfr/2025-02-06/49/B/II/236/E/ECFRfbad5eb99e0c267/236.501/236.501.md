# ยง 236.501   Forestalling device and speed control.

(a) An automatic train stop system may include a device by means of which the automatic application of the brakes can be forestalled.


(b) Automatic train control system shall include one or more of the following features:


(1) Low-speed restriction, requiring the train to proceed under slow speed after it has either been stopped by an automatic application of the brakes, or under control of the engineman, its speed has been reduced to slow speed, until the apparatus is automatically restored to normal because the condition which caused the restriction no longer affects the movement of the train.


(2) Medium-speed restriction, requiring the train to proceed under medium speed after passing a signal displaying an approach aspect or when approaching a signal requiring a stop, or a stop indication point, in order to prevent an automatic application of the brakes.


(3) Maximum-speed restriction, effecting an automatic brake application whenever the predetermined maximum speed limit is exceeded.
