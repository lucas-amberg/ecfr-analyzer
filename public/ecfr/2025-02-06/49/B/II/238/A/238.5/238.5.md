*Administrator* means the Administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration or the Administrator's delegate.


*Alerter* means a device or system installed in the locomotive cab to promote continuous, active locomotive engineer attentiveness by monitoring select locomotive engineer-induced control activities. If fluctuation of a monitored locomotive engineer-induced control activity is not detected within a predetermined time, a sequence of audible and visual alarms is activated so as to progressively prompt a response by the locomotive engineer. Failure by the locomotive engineer to institute a change of state in a monitored control, or acknowledge the alerter alarm activity through a manual reset provision, results in a penalty brake application that brings the locomotive or train to a stop.

*Brake, effective* means a brake that is capable of producing its required designed retarding force on the train. A brake is not effective if its piston travel is in excess of the maximum prescribed limits. On vehicles equipped with nominal 12-inch stroke brake cylinders, the brake is not effective if its piston travel exceeds 10
1/2 inches. 


*Brake indicator* means a device, actuated by brake cylinder pressure, which indicates whether brakes are applied or released.

This may be accomplished by designing energy-absorbing structures of low strength in the unoccupied volumes of a rail vehicle or passenger train to collapse in a controlled manner, while providing higher structural strength in the occupied volumes. Energy deflection can also be part of a crash energy management approach. Crash energy management can be used to help provide anti-climbing resistance and to reduce the risk of train buckling during a collision.
