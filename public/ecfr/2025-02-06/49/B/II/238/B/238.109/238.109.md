# § 238.109   Training, qualification, and designation program.

(a) Beginning on January 1, 2002, each railroad shall have adopted a training, qualification, and designation program for employees and contractors that perform any of the inspections, tests, or maintenance required by this part, and shall have trained such employees and contractors in accordance with the program. A railroad may request earlier application of these requirements upon written notification to FRA's Associate Administrator for Safety as provided in § 238.1(c). For purposes of this section, a “contractor” is defined as a person under contract with the railroad or an employee of a person under contract with the railroad to perform any of the tasks required by this part.


(b) As part of this program, the railroad shall, at a minimum: 


(1) Identify the tasks related to the inspection, testing, and maintenance required by this part that must be performed on each type of equipment that the railroad operates; 


(2) Develop written procedures for the performance of the tasks identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; 


(3) Identify the skills and knowledge necessary to perform each task identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; 


(4) Adopt a training curriculum that includes classroom and “hands-on” lessons designed to impart the skills and knowledge identified as necessary to perform each task identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The training curriculum shall specifically address the Federal regulatory requirements contained in this part that are related to the performance of the tasks identified; 


(5) Require all employees and contractors to successfully complete the training course that covers the equipment and tasks for which they are responsible that are required by this part as well as the specific Federal regulatory requirements contained in this part related to equipment and tasks for which they are responsible; 


(6) Require all employees and contractors to pass either a written or an oral examination covering the equipment and tasks for which they are responsible that are required by this part as well as the specific Federal regulatory requirements contained in this part related to equipment and tasks for which they are responsible;


(7) Require all employees and contractors to individually demonstrate “hands-on” capability to successfully perform the tasks required by this part that must be performed as part of their duties on the type equipment to which they are assigned; 


(8) Require supervisors to complete the program that covers the employees whom they supervise, including refresher training;


(9) Require supervisors to exercise oversight to ensure that all the identified tasks are performed in accordance with the railroad's written procedures;


(10) Designate in writing that each employee and contractor has the knowledge and skills necessary to perform the safety-related tasks that are part of his or her job;


(11) Require periodic refresher training, at an interval not to exceed three years, that includes classroom and “hands-on” training, as well as testing; except, employees and contractors that have completed their initial training under this part prior to January 1, 2002, shall not be required to complete their first periodic refresher training until four years after the completion of their initial training, and every three years thereafter; 


(12) Add new equipment to the qualification and designation program prior to its introduction to revenue service; and


(13) Maintain records adequate to demonstrate that each employee and contractor performing safety-related tasks on passenger equipment is currently qualified to do so. These records shall be adequate to distinguish the qualifications of the employee or contractor as a qualified person or as a qualified maintenance person.
