(vi) A record is maintained of the inoperative or ineffective air compressor pursuant to the requirements contained in § 238.17(c)(4); and


(vii) Prior to operating equipment under the provisions contained in this paragraph, the railroad shall provide in writing to FRA's Associate Administrator for Safety the maximum number of inoperative or ineffective air compressors identified in accordance with paragraph (e)(17)(ii) of this section.


(viii) The data, analysis, or testing developed and conducted under paragraph (e)(17)(ii) of this section shall be made available to FRA upon request. FRA's Associate Administrator for Safety may revoke a railroad's ability to utilize the flexibility provided in this paragraph if the railroad fails to comply with the maximum limits established under paragraph (e)(17)(ii) or if such maximum limits are not supported by credible data or do not provide adequate safety assurances.


(18) All rescue-access-related exterior markings, signage, and instructions required by §§ 238.112 and 238.114 shall be in place and, as applicable, conspicuous or legible, or both.


(i) Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(18)(ii) and (iii) of this section, passenger equipment that has any required rescue-access-related exterior marking, signage, or instruction that is missing, illegible, or inconspicuous may remain in passenger service until no later than the equipment's fourth exterior calendar day mechanical inspection or next periodic mechanical inspection required under § 238.307, whichever occurs first, after the noncomplying condition is discovered, where the car shall be repaired or removed from service.


(ii) A passenger car having more than 50 percent of the windows on a side of a level of the car designated and properly marked for rescue access that has any required rescue-access-related exterior marking, signage, or instruction that is missing, illegible, or inconspicuous on any of the other windows on that side and level of the car may remain in passenger service until no later than the car's next periodic mechanical inspection required under § 238.307, where the car shall be repaired or removed from service.


(iii) A passenger car that is a sleeping car that has more than two consecutive windows with any required rescue access-related exterior marking, signage, or instruction at or near their locations that is missing, illegible, or inconspicuous may remain in passenger service until no later than the car's next periodic mechanical inspection required under § 238.307, where the car shall be repaired or removed from service.


(iv) A record shall be maintained of any noncomplying marking, signage, or instruction described in paragraphs (e)(18)(i) through (iii) of this section that contains the date and time that the defective condition was first discovered. This record shall be retained until all necessary repairs are completed.


(f) *Exception.* A long-distance intercity passenger train that misses a scheduled exterior calendar day mechanical inspection due to a delay en route may continue in service to the location where the inspection was scheduled to be performed. At that point, an exterior calendar day mechanical inspection shall be performed prior to returning the equipment to service. This flexibility applies only to the exterior mechanical safety inspections required by this section, and does not relieve the railroad of the responsibility to perform a calendar day inspection on a unit classified as a “locomotive” under part 229 of this chapter as required by § 229.21 of this chapter.


(g) *Records.* A record shall be maintained of each exterior calendar day mechanical inspection performed.


(1) This record may be maintained in writing or electronically provided FRA has access to the record upon request.


(2) The written or electronic record must contain the following information:


(i) The identification number of the unit;


(ii) The place, date, and time of the inspection;


(iii) Any non-complying conditions found; and


(iv) The signature or electronic identification of the inspector. 


(3) This record may be part of a single master report covering an entire group of cars and equipment.


(4) This record shall be maintained at the place where the inspection is conducted or at one central location and shall be retained for at least 92 days.


(h) Cars requiring a single car test in accordance with § 238.311 that are being moved in service to a location where the single car test can be performed shall have the single car test completed prior to, or as a part of, the exterior calendar day mechanical inspection.
