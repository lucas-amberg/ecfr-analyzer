# § 238.409   Forward end structures of power car cabs.

This section contains requirements for the forward end structure of the cab of a power car. (A conceptual implementation of this end structure is provided in Figure 1 to this subpart.)


(a) *Center collision post.* The forward end structure shall have a full-height center collision post, or its structural equivalent, capable of withstanding the following:


(1) A shear load of 500,000 pounds at its joint with the underframe without exceeding the ultimate strength of the joint;


(2) A shear load of 150,000 pounds at its joint with the roof without exceeding the ultimate strength of the joint; and


(3) A horizontal, longitudinal force of 300,000 pounds, applied at a point on level with the bottom of the windshield, without exceeding its ultimate strength.


(b) *Side collision posts.* The forward end structure shall have two side collision posts, or their structural equivalent, located at approximately the one-third points laterally, each capable of withstanding the following:


(1) A shear load of 500,000 pounds at its joint with the underframe without exceeding the ultimate strength of the joint; and


(2) A horizontal, longitudinal force of 300,000 pounds, applied at a point on level with the bottom of the windshield, without exceeding its ultimate strength.


(c) *Corner posts.* The forward end structure shall have two full-height corner posts, or their structural equivalent, each capable of withstanding the following:


(1) A horizontal, longitudinal or lateral shear load of 300,000 pounds at its joint with the underframe, without exceeding the ultimate strength of the joint;


(2) A horizontal, lateral force of 100,000 pounds applied at a point 30 inches up from the underframe attachment, without exceeding the yield or the critical buckling stress; and


(3) A horizontal, longitudinal or lateral shear load of 80,000 pounds at its joint with the roof, without exceeding the ultimate strength of the joint.


(d) *Skin.* The skin covering the forward-facing end of each power car shall be:


(1) Equivalent to a 
1/2-inch steel plate with a 25,000 pounds-per-square-inch yield strength—material of a higher yield strength may be used to decrease the required thickness of the material provided at least an equivalent level of strength is maintained;


(2) Securely attached to the end structure; and


(3) Sealed to prevent the entry of fluids into the occupied cab area of the equipment. As used in paragraph (d), the term “skin” does not include forward-facing windows and doors.
