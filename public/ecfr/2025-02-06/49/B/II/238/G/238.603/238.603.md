The plan may be combined with any other plan required under this part. The plan shall describe the approaches and processes to:


(1) Identify all safety requirements governing the design of the passenger equipment and its supporting systems;


(2) Evaluate the total system, including hardware, software, testing, and support activities, to identify known or potential safety hazards over the life cycle of the equipment;


(3) Identify safety issues during design reviews;


(4) Eliminate or reduce the risk posed by each hazard identified to an acceptable level using a formal safety methodology such as MIL-STD-882;


(5) Monitor the progress in resolving safety issues, reducing hazards, and meeting safety requirements;


(6) Develop a program of testing or analysis, or both, to demonstrate that safety requirements have been met; and


(7) Impose operational limitations, as necessary, on the operation of the equipment if the equipment cannot meet safety requirements.


(c) Each railroad shall maintain sufficient documentation to demonstrate how the operation and design of its Tier II passenger equipment complies with safety requirements or, as appropriate, addresses safety requirements under paragraphs (a)(4) and (b)(7) of this section. Each railroad shall maintain sufficient documentation to track how safety issues are raised and resolved.
