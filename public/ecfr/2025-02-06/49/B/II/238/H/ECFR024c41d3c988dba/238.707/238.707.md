# ยง 238.707   Override protection.

(a) *Colliding equipment.* (1) Using the dynamic collision scenario described in ยง 238.705(a), anti-climbing performance shall be evaluated for each of the following sets of initial conditions:


(i) All vehicles in the initially-moving trainset and initially-standing train consists are positioned at their nominal running heights;


(ii) The lead vehicle of the initially-moving trainset shall be perturbed laterally and vertically upwards by 3 inches at the colliding interface; and


(iii) The lead vehicle of the initially-moving trainset shall be perturbed laterally and vertically downwards by 3 inches at the colliding interface.


(2) For each set of initial conditions specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, compliance with the following conditions shall be demonstrated after a dynamic impact:


(i) The relative difference in elevation between the underframes of the colliding equipment in the initially-moving trainset and initially-standing train consists shall not change by more than 4 inches; and


(ii) The tread of any wheel of the first vehicle of the initially-moving trainset shall not rise above the top of the rail by more than 4 inches


(b) *Connected equipment override.* (1) Using the dynamic collision scenario described in ยง 238.705(a), anti-climbing performance shall be evaluated for each of the following sets of initial conditions:


(i) All vehicles in the initially-moving trainset and initially-standing train consists are positioned at their nominal running heights;


(ii) One vehicle is perturbed laterally and vertically upwards by 2 inches, relative to the adjacent vehicle, at the first vehicle-to-vehicle interface in the initially-moving trainset; and,


(iii) One vehicle is perturbed laterally and vertically downwards by 2 inches, relative to the adjacent vehicle, at the first vehicle-to-vehicle interface in the initially-moving trainset.


(2) For each set of initial conditions specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, compliance with the following conditions shall be demonstrated after a dynamic impact:


(i) The relative difference in elevation between the underframes of the connected equipment in the initially-moving trainset shall not change by more than 4 inches; and


(ii) The tread of any wheel of the initially-moving trainset shall not rise above the top of rail by more than 4 inches.
