# ยง 238.717   Truck-to-carbody attachment.

To demonstrate the integrity of truck-to-carbody attachments, each unit in a Tier III trainset shall:


(a) Comply with the requirements in ยง 238.219; or


(b) Have a truck-to-carbody attachment with strength sufficient to resist, without yielding, the following individually applied, quasi-static loads on the mass of the truck at its CG:


(1) 3g vertically downward;


(2) 1g laterally, along with the resulting vertical reaction to this load; and


(3) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, 5g longitudinally, along with the resulting vertical reaction to this load, provided that for the conditions in the dynamic collision scenario described in ยง 238.705(a):


(i) The average longitudinal deceleration at the CG of the equipment during the impact does not exceed 5g; and


(ii) The peak longitudinal deceleration of the truck during the impact does not exceed 10g.


(c) As an alternative to demonstrating compliance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the truck shall be shown to remain attached after a dynamic impact under the conditions in the collision scenario described in ยง 238.705(a).


(d) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the mass of the truck includes axles, wheels, bearings, truck-mounted brake system, suspension system components, and any other component attached to the truck by design.


(e) Truck attachment shall be demonstrated using a validated model.
