# Appendix D to Part 240—Identification of State Agencies That Perform National Driver Register Checks


Under the provisions of § 240.111, each person seeking certification or recertification as a locomotive operator must request that a check of the National Driver Register (NDR) be conducted and that the resulting information be furnished to his or her employer or prospective employer. Under the provisions of paragraphs (d) and (e) of § 240.111, each person seeking certification or recertification as a locomotive engineer must request that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) conduct the NDR check, unless he or she was issued a motor vehicle driver license by one of the State agencies that perform such checks, which today includes all State agencies and the District of Columbia. If the certification candidate received a license from one of the State agencies or the District of Columbia, he or she must request the State agency to perform the NDR check. Since these State agencies can more efficiently supply the desired data and, in some instances, can provide a higher quality of information, FRA requires that certification candidates make use of this method in preference to contacting NHTSA directly.
