# § 240.225   Reliance on qualification determinations made by other railroads.

(a) A railroad that is considering certification of a person as a qualified engineer may rely on determinations made by another railroad concerning that person's qualifications. The railroad's certification program shall address how the railroad will administer the training of previously uncertified engineers with extensive operating experience or previously certified engineers who have had their certification expire. If a railroad's certification program fails to specify how it will train a previously certified engineer hired from another railroad, then the railroad shall require the newly hired engineer to take the hiring railroad's entire training program.


(b) A railroad relying on another's certification shall determine that:


(1) The prior certification is still valid in accordance with the provisions of §§ 240.201, 240.217, and 240.307;


(2) The prior certification was for the same classification of locomotive or train service as the certification being issued under this section;


(3) The person has received training on and visually observed the physical characteristics of the new territory in accordance with § 240.123;


(4) The person has demonstrated the necessary knowledge concerning the railroad's operating rules in accordance with § 240.125; and


(5) The person has demonstrated the necessary performance skills concerning the railroad's operating rules in accordance with § 240.127.
