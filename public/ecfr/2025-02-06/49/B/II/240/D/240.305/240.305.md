# § 240.305   Prohibited conduct.

(a) It shall be unlawful to:


(1) Operate a locomotive or train past a signal indication, excluding a hand or a radio signal indication or a switch, that requires a complete stop before passing it; or


(2) Operate a locomotive or train at a speed which exceeds the maximum authorized limit by at least 10 miles per hour. Where restricted speed is in effect, only those violations of the conditional clause of restricted speed rules (i.e., the clause that requires stopping within one half of the locomotive engineer's range of vision), or the operational equivalent thereof, which cause reportable accidents or incidents under part 225 of this chapter, shall be considered instances of failure to adhere to this section; or


(3) Operate a locomotive or train without adhering to procedures for the safe use of train or engine brakes when the procedures are required for compliance with the Class I, Class IA, Class II, Class III, or transfer train brake test provisions of 49 CFR part 232 or when the procedures are required for compliance with the class 1, class 1A, class II, or running brake test provisions of 49 CFR part 238;


(4) Fail to comply with any mandatory directive concerning the movement of a locomotive or train by occupying main track or a segment of main track without proper authority or permission;


(5) Fail to comply with prohibitions against tampering with locomotive mounted safety devices, or knowingly operate or permit to be operated a train with an unauthorized disabled safety device in the controlling locomotive. (See 49 CFR part 218, subpart D, and appendix C to part 218);


(6) Be a Designated Supervisor of Locomotive Engineers, a certified locomotive engineer pilot or an instructor engineer who is monitoring, piloting or instructing a locomotive engineer and fails to take appropriate action to prevent a violation of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section. Appropriate action does not mean that a supervisor, pilot or instructor must prevent a violation from occurring at all costs; the duty may be met by warning an engineer of a potential or foreseeable violation. A Designated Supervisor of Locomotive Engineers will not be held culpable under this section when this monitoring event is conducted as part of the railroad's operational compliance tests as defined in §§ 217.9 and 240.303 of this chapter.


(b) Each locomotive engineer who has received a certificate required under this part shall:


(1) Have that certificate in his or her possession while on duty as an engineer; and


(2) Display that certificate upon the receipt of a request to do so from:


(i) A representative of the Federal Railroad Administration;


(ii) A State inspector authorized under part 212 of this chapter;


(iii) An officer of the issuing railroad; or


(iv) An officer of another railroad when operating a locomotive or train in joint operations territory.


(c) Any locomotive engineer who is notified or called to operate a locomotive or train and such operation would cause the locomotive engineer to exceed certificate limitations, set forth in accordance with subpart B of this part, shall immediately notify the railroad that he or she is not qualified to perform that anticipated service and it shall be unlawful for the railroad to require such service.


(d) During the duration of any certification interval, a locomotive engineer who has a current certificate from more than one railroad shall immediately notify the other certifying railroad(s) if he or she is denied recertification by a railroad or has his or her certification revoked by a railroad.


(e) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to alter a certified locomotive engineer's duty to comply with other provisions of this chapter concerning railroad safety.
