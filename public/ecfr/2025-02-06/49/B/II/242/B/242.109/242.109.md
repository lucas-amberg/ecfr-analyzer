# § 242.109   Determinations required for certification and recertification.

(a) After the pertinent date specified in § 242.105(d) or (e), each railroad, prior to initially certifying or recertifying any person as a conductor, shall, in accordance with its FRA-approved program, determine in writing that:


(1) The individual meets the eligibility requirements of §§ 242.111, 242.113, 242.115, and 242.403; and


(2) The individual meets the vision and hearing acuity standards of § 242.117 (“Vision and hearing acuity”);


(3) The individual has the necessary knowledge, as demonstrated by successfully completing a test that meets the requirements of § 242.121 (“Knowledge testing”); and


(4) Where a person has not previously been certified, that the person has completed a training program that meets the requirements of § 242.119 (“Training”).


(b) When evaluating a person's prior safety conduct, a railroad shall not consider information concerning prior conduct that:


(1) Occurred prior to the effective date of this rule; or


(2) Occurred at a time other than that specifically provided for in §§ 242.111, 242.115 or 242.403.


(c) In order to make the determination required under paragraph (a) of this section, a railroad shall have on file documents pertinent to those determinations.


(d) A railroad's program shall provide a candidate for certification or recertification a reasonable opportunity to review and comment in writing on any record which contains information concerning the person's prior safety conduct, including information pertinent to determinations required under § 242.115, if the railroad believes the record contains information that could be sufficient to render the person ineligible for certification under this subpart.


(e) The opportunity for comment shall be afforded to the person prior to the railroad's rendering its eligibility decision based on that information. Any responsive comment furnished shall be retained by the railroad in accordance with § 242.203.


(f) The program shall include a method for a person to advise the railroad that he or she has never been a railroad employee or obtained a license to drive a motor vehicle. Nothing in this section shall be construed as imposing a duty or requirement that a person have prior railroad employment experience or obtain a motor vehicle driver's license in order to become a certified conductor.


(g) Nothing in this section, § 242.111 or § 242.113 shall be construed to prevent persons subject to this part from entering into an agreement that results in a railroad's obtaining the information needed for compliance with this subpart in a different manner than that prescribed in § 242.111 or § 242.113.
