# § 242.125   Certification determinations made by other railroads.

(a) A railroad that is considering certification of a person as a conductor may rely on determinations made by another railroad concerning that person's certification. The railroad's certification program shall address how the railroad will administer the training of previously uncertified conductors with extensive operating experience or previously certified conductors who have had their certification expire. If a railroad's certification program fails to specify how it will train a previously certified conductor hired from another railroad, then the railroad shall require the newly hired conductor to take the hiring railroad's entire training program.


(b) A railroad relying on another railroad's certification shall determine that:


(1) The prior certification is still valid in accordance with the provisions of §§ 242.201 and 242.407;


(2) The prior certification was for the same type of service as the certification being issued under this section;


(3) The person has received training on the physical characteristics of the new territory in accordance with § 242.119; and


(4) The person has demonstrated the necessary knowledge concerning the railroad's operating rules in accordance with § 242.121.
