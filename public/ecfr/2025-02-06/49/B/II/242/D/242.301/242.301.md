(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this section, a railroad, including a railroad that employs conductors working in joint operations territory, shall not permit or require a person to serve as a conductor unless that railroad determines that the person is certified as a conductor and possesses the necessary territorial qualifications for the applicable territory pursuant to ยง 242.119.


(b) Each person who is called to serve as a conductor shall:


(1) Meet the territorial qualification requirements on the segment of track upon which he or she will serve as a conductor; and
