# ยง 243.105   Optional model program development.

(a) Any organization, business, or association may develop and submit one or more model training programs to FRA for review and approval so that the model program(s) may be used by multiple employers.


(1) Any such model program should be submitted with a unique identifier associated with the program, or FRA will assign a unique identifier.


(2) The program associated with the organization's unique identifier shall include all information required by ยง 243.103.


(3) Each model training program submitted to FRA before May 1, 2019, is considered approved and may be implemented 180 days after the date of submission unless the Associate Administrator advises the organization, business, or association that developed and submitted the program that all or part of the program does not conform.
