# ยง 244.1   Scope, application, and purpose.

(a) This part prescribes requirements for filing and implementing a Safety Integration Plan with FRA whenever a Class I railroad proposes to consolidate with, merge with, or acquire control of another Class I railroad, or with a Class II railroad where there is a proposed amalgamation of operations. 


(b) The purpose of this part is to achieve a reasonable level of railroad safety during the implementation of transactions described in paragraph (a) of this section. This part does not preclude a railroad from taking additional measures not inconsistent with this part to provide for safety in connection with a transaction. 


(c) The requirements prescribed under this part apply only to FRA's disposition of a regulated transaction filed by an applicant. The transactions covered by this part also require separate filing with and approval by the Surface Transportation Board. *See* 49 CFR part 1106.
