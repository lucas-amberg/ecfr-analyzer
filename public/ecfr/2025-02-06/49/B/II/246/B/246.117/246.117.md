# ยง 246.117   Visual acuity.

(a) After FRA has approved a railroad's signal employee certification program, the railroad shall determine, prior to issuing any person a signal employee certificate, that the person meets the standards for visual acuity prescribed in this section and appendix B to this part.


(b) Any examination required under this section shall be performed by or under the supervision of a medical examiner or a licensed physician's assistant.


(c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, each certified signal employee shall have visual acuity that meets or exceeds the following thresholds:


(1) For distant viewing, either:


(i) Distant visual acuity of at least 20/40 (Snellen) in each eye without corrective lenses; or


(ii) Distant visual acuity separately corrected to at least 20/40 (Snellen) with corrective lenses and distant binocular acuity of at least 20/40 (Snellen) in both eyes with or without corrective lenses;


(2) A field of vision of at least 70 degrees in the horizontal meridian in each eye; and


(3) The ability to recognize and distinguish between the colors of railroad signals as demonstrated by successfully completing one of the tests in appendix B to this part.


(d) A person not meeting the thresholds in paragraph (c) of this section shall, upon request of the certification candidate, be subject to further medical evaluation by a railroad's medical examiner to determine that person's ability to safely perform as a certified signal employee. In such cases, the following procedures will apply:


(1) In accordance with the guidance prescribed in appendix B to this part, a person is entitled to:


(i) One retest without making any showing; and


(ii) An additional retest if the person provides evidence that circumstances have changed since the last test to the extent that the person may now be able to safely perform as a certified signal employee.


(2) The railroad shall provide its medical examiner with a copy of this part, including all appendices.


(3) If, after consultation with a railroad officer, the medical examiner concludes that, despite not meeting the threshold(s) in paragraph (c) of this section, the person has the ability to safely perform as a certified signal employee, the railroad may conclude that the person satisfies the visual acuity requirements of this section to be a certified signal employee. Such certification will be conditioned on any special restrictions the medical examiner determines in writing to be necessary.


(e) To make the determination required under paragraph (a) of this section, a railroad shall have on file the following for each certification candidate:


(1) A medical examiner's certificate that the candidate has been medically examined and either does or does not meet the visual acuity standards prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.


(2) If necessary under paragraph (d) of this section, a medical examiner's written professional opinion which states the basis for their determination that:


(i) The candidate can be certified, under certain conditions if necessary, even though the candidate does not meet the visual acuity standards prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section; or


(ii) The candidate's visual acuity prevents the candidate from being able to safely perform as a certified signal employee.


(f) If the examination required under this section shows that the person needs corrective lenses to meet the standards for visual acuity prescribed in this section and appendix B to this part, that person shall use corrective lenses at all times while performing as a certified signal employee unless the railroad's medical examiner subsequently determines in writing that the person can safely perform as a certified signal employee without corrective lenses.


(g) When a certified signal employee becomes aware that their vision has deteriorated, they shall notify the railroad's medical department or other appropriate railroad official of the deterioration. Such notification must occur prior to performing any subsequent service as a certified signal employee. The individual cannot return to service as a certified signal employee until they are reexamined and determined by the railroad's medical examiner to satisfy the visual acuity standards prescribed in this section and appendix B to this part.


(h) Each railroad shall adopt and comply with a program meeting the requirements of this section. When any person (including but not limited to a railroad; any manager, supervisor, official, or agent of a railroad; any owner, manufacturer, lessor, or lessee of railroad equipment, track, or facilities; any employee of such owner, manufacturer, lessor, lessee, or independent contractor or subcontractor) violates any requirement of a program which complies with the requirements of this section, that person shall be considered to have violated the requirements of this section.
