(i) Complete rehabilitation and refurbishment of the interior and exterior of the structure;


(ii) Provision of necessary public service facilities;

(c) *Planning funds.* Federal financial assistance granted under subsection 4(i)(5) of the Act for the development of plans for the conversion of a railroad passenger terminal into an intermodal passenger terminal, which may incorporate civic and cultural activities where feasible, may be expended for the following project costs if incurred within two years after project approval:


(1) Cost of a study or studies to:


(i) Assess the need for and the feasibility of converting an existing railroad passenger terminal into an intermodal passenger terminal which may incorporate civic and cultural activities where feasible;


(ii) Develop a fiscal plan and agreements for the plan's implementation; and


(iii)(A) Relate the project to other transportation priorities in the area; and


(B) Evaluate alternate means of providing needed intermodal passenger services within the community.


(2) Costs of preparation of preliminary architectural and engineering design documents for the project, including:


(i) Plans, sections, and sketches illustrating the functional as well as preservation aspects of the recommended development;


(ii) Assessment of the condition of existing structural and utilities systems and requirements for their improvement;


(iii) Outline specifications and preliminary estimates of project costs; and


(iv) Required environmental impact reviews and analyses.


(d) *Federal share.* The Federal share of any project under this part shall not exceed 80 percent of the total allowable project costs. The non-Federal share may not be augmented by any Federal funds, directly or indirectly, unless the funds are provided through a Federal program which specifically authorizes the augmentation of a non-Federal share of a federally-assisted program with such funds.
