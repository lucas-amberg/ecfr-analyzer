# ยง 262.9   Criteria for selection of projects.

Applicants must submit evidence sufficient for the FRA to determine whether projects proposed for Federal investment are cost-effective in terms of the benefits achieved in relation to the funds expended.

In evaluating applications, FRA will consider the following factors in determining whether to grant an award to a State under this part.


(a) The capability of the State to fund the rail line relocation project without Federal grant funding;


(b) The requirement and limitation relating to allocation of grant funds provided in ยง 262.5;


(c) Equitable treatment of various regions of the United States;


(d) The effects of the rail line, relocated or improved as proposed, on motor vehicle and pedestrian traffic, safety, community quality of life, and area commerce;


(e) The effects of the rail line, relocated as proposed, on the freight rail and passenger rail operations on the line;


(f) Any other factors FRA determines to be relevant to assessing the effectiveness and/or efficiency of the grant application in achieving the goals of the national program, including the level of commitment of non-Federal and/or private funds to a project and the anticipated public and private benefits.
