# ยง 271.205   System description.

(a) An RRP plan shall contain a description of the characteristics of the railroad's system. At a minimum, the system description shall:


(1) Support the identification of hazards by establishing a basic understanding of the scope of the railroad's system;


(2) Include components briefly describing the railroad's history, operations, scope of service, maintenance, physical plant, and system requirements;


(3) Identify all persons that enter into a contractual relationship with the railroad to either perform significant safety-related services on the railroad's behalf or to utilize significant safety-related services provided by the railroad for railroad operations purposes. For example, a railroad's RRP plan shall identify entities such as host railroads, contract operators, shared track/corridor operators, or other contractors utilizing or performing significant safety-related services. A railroad shall identify such persons even if the persons are not required to comply with this part (*e.g.,* a railroad shall identify a tourist railroad that operates over the railroad's track even though the tourist railroad is exempt from this part pursuant to ยง 271.3(b)(2)); and


(4) Describe how the railroad will ensure that any persons identified pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section will support and participate in the railroad's RRP. For example, the system description shall describe the extent to which such persons will, as part of the railroad's RRP, assist in identifying hazards, developing and implementing mitigation strategies, conducting internal annual assessments, or otherwise performing actions required by this part.
