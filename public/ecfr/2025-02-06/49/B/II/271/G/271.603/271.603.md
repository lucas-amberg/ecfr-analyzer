# ยง 271.603   Purpose and scope of a Fatigue Risk Management Program (FRMP).

(a) *Purpose.* The purpose of an FRMP is to improve railroad safety through structured, proactive processes and procedures a railroad subject to this part develops and implements. A railroad's FRMP shall systematically identify and evaluate the fatigue-related railroad safety hazards on its system, determine the degree of risk associated with each hazard, and manage those risks to reduce the fatigue that its safety-related railroad employees experience and to reduce the risk of railroad accidents, incidents, injuries, and fatalities where the fatigue of any of these employees is a contributing factor.


(b) *Scope.* A railroad shall:


(1) Design its FRMP to reduce the fatigue its safety-related railroad employees experience and to reduce the risk of railroad accidents, incidents, injuries, and fatalities where the fatigue of any of these employees is a contributing factor;


(2) Develop its FRMP by conducting a system-wide fatigue-risk analysis that accounts for the varying circumstances of its operations on different parts of its system; and


(3) Employ in its FRMP the fatigue risk mitigation strategies the railroad identifies as appropriate to address those varying circumstances.
