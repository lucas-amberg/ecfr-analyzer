(i) Notify FRA in accordance with § 299.9 of the design changes made by the product supplier;


(ii) Ensure that the safety analysis required under paragraph (c)(2) of this section is updated as required;


(iii) Conduct all safety-critical changes in a manner that allows the change to be audited;


(iv) Document all arrangements with suppliers for notification of all electronic safety-critical changes as well as safety-critical failures in the supplier's system, subsystem, or components, and the reasons for that change or failure from the suppliers, whether or not the railroad has experienced a failure of that safety-critical system, sub-system, or component;


(v) Specify the railroad's procedures for action upon receipt of notification of a safety-critical change or failure of an electronic system, sub-system, or component, and until the upgrade or revision has been installed;


(vi) Identify all configuration/revision control measures designed to ensure that safety-functional requirements and safety-critical hazard mitigation processes are not compromised as a result of any such change, and that any such change can be audited;


(vii) Require suppliers to provide notification of all electronic safety-critical changes as well as safety-critical failures in the supplier's system, subsystem, or components;


(ix) Document all arrangements with suppliers for notification of any and all electronic safety-critical changes as well as safety-critical failures in the supplier's system, subsystem, or components.


(d) *Specific requirements.* Hardware and software that controls or monitors a trainset's primary braking system shall either—


(1) Fail safely by initiating an emergency or urgent brake application in the event of a hardware or software failure that could impair the ability of the driver to apply or release the brakes; or


(2) Provide the driver access to direct manual control of the primary braking system (emergency or urgent braking).


(e) *Inspection, testing, and maintenance records.* The inspection, testing, and maintenance conducted by the railroad in accordance with § 299.445 shall be recorded in hardcopy or stored electronically. Electronic recordkeeping or automated tracking systems, subject to the provisions contained in § 299.11, may be utilized to store and maintain any testing or training record required by this subpart. Results of product testing conducted by a vendor in support of a safety analysis shall be provided to and recorded by the railroad.


(1) The testing records shall contain all of the following:


(i) The name of the railroad;


(ii) The location and date that the test was conducted;


(iii) The equipment tested;


(iv) The results of tests;


(v) The repairs or replacement of equipment;


(vi) Any preventative adjustments made; and


(vii) The condition in which the equipment is left.


(2) Each record shall be—


(i) Signed by the employee conducting the test, or electronically coded, or identified by the automated test equipment number;


(ii) Filed in the office of a supervisory official having jurisdiction, unless otherwise noted; and


(iii) Available for inspection and copying by FRA.


(3) The results of the testing conducted in accordance with this section shall be retained as follows:


(i) The results of tests that pertain to installation or modification of a product shall be retained for the life-cycle of the product tested and may be kept in any office designated by the railroad;


(ii) The results of periodic tests required for the maintenance or repair of the product tested shall be retained until the next record is filed and in no case less than one year; and


(iii) The results of all other tests and training shall be retained until the next record is filed and in no case less than one year.


(f) *Review of safety analysis.* (1) Prior to the initial planned use of a new product as defined by paragraphs (b)(2) or (3) of this section, the railroad shall notify FRA in accordance with § 299.9 of the intent to place this product in service. The notification shall provide a description of the product, and identify the location where the complete safety analysis documentation and the testing are maintained.

(g) *Hazard tracking.* After a new product is placed in service in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2) or (3) of this section, the railroad shall maintain a database of all safety-relevant hazards encountered with the product. The database shall include all hazards identified in the safety analysis and those that had not been previously identified in the safety analysis. If the frequency of the safety-relevant hazards exceeds the threshold set forth in the safety analysis, then the railroad shall—


(1) Report the inconsistency to the Associate Administrator, within 15 days of discovery in accordance with § 299.9;


(2) Take immediate countermeasures to reduce the frequency of the safety-relevant hazard(s) below the threshold set forth in the safety analysis;


(3) Provide a final report to the Associate Administrator, on the results of the analysis and countermeasures taken to mitigate the hazard to meet the threshold set forth in the safety analysis when the problem is resolved.
