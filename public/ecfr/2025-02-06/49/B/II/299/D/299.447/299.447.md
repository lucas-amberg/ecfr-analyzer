# § 299.447   Movement of defective equipment.

(a) A trainset with one or more conditions not in compliance with the list of safety critical defects identified in accordance with § 299.445(b) during a pre-service inspection required by § 299.445(e)(1) shall not be moved in revenue service and shall only be moved in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.


(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, and after departure in compliance with the pre-service inspection required by § 299.445(e)(1), a trainset with one or more conditions not in compliance with the list of safety critical defects identified in accordance with §§ 299.445(b) and 299.711(b) may be moved in revenue service only after the railroad has complied with all of the following:


(1) A qualified individual determines that it is safe to move the trainset, consistent with the railroad's operating rules;


(i) If appropriate, these determinations may be made based upon a description of the defective condition provided by a crewmember.


(ii) If the determinations required by this paragraph are made by an off-site qualified individual based on a description of the defective condition by on-site personnel, then a qualified individual shall perform a physical inspection of the defective equipment, at the first location possible, in accordance with the railroad's inspection, testing, and maintenance program and operating rules, to verify the description of the defect provided by the on-site personnel.


(2) The qualified individual who made the determination in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, notifies the driver in charge of movement of the trainset, in accordance with the railroad's operating rules, of the maximum authorized speed, authorized destination, and any other operational restrictions that apply to the movement of the non-compliant trainset. This notification may be achieved through the tag required by paragraph (b)(3) of this section; and


(3) A tag bearing the words “non-complying trainset” and containing the following information, are securely attached to the control stand on each control cab of the trainset:


(i) The trainset number and unit or car number;


(ii) The name of the qualified individual making the determination in paragraph (b)(1) of this section;


(iii) The location and date of the inspection that led to the discovery of the non-compliant item;


(iv) A description of each defect;


(v) Movement restrictions, if any;


(vi) The authorized destination of the trainset; and


(vii) The signature, if possible, as well as the job title and location of the person making the determinations required by this section.


(4) Automated tracking systems used to meet the tagging requirements contained in paragraph (b)(3) of this section may be reviewed and monitored by FRA at any time to ensure the integrity of the system. FRA's Associate Administrator may prohibit or revoke the railroad's ability to utilize an automated tracking system in lieu of tagging if FRA finds that the automated tracking system is not properly secure, is inaccessible to FRA or the railroad's employees, or fails to track or monitor the movement of defective equipment adequately. Such a determination will be made in writing and will state the basis for such action.


(c) A trainset that develops a non-complying condition in service may continue in revenue service, so long as the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section are otherwise fully met, until the next pre-service inspection.


(d) In the event of an in-service failure of the braking system, the trainset may proceed in accordance with the railroad's operating rules relating to the percentage of operative brakes and at a speed no greater than the maximum authorized speed as determined by § 299.409(f)(4) so long as the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section are otherwise fully met, until the next pre-service inspection.


(e) A non-complying trainset may be moved without passengers within a trainset maintenance facility, at speeds not to exceed 16 km/h (10 mph), without meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section where the movement is solely for the purpose of repair. The railroad shall ensure that the movement is made safely.


(f) Nothing in this section authorizes the movement of equipment subject to a Special Notice for Repair under part 216 of this chapter unless the movement is made in accordance with the restrictions contained in the Special Notice.
