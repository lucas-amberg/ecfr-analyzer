(i) May remove from service the entire image recording system or an image recording device in a leading trainset cab used in revenue service for any reason.


(ii) Must remove from service the entire image recording system or an image recording device in a leading trainset cab used in revenue service if the railroad knows the system or device is not properly recording.


(2) When a railroad removes the entire image recording system or an image recording device in a leading trainset cab used in revenue service from service, a qualified person shall record the date the system or device was removed from service in the trainset's maintenance records.


(3) A trainset on which the entire image recording system, or an image recording device in a leading trainset cab used in revenue service, has been taken out of service as provided in paragraphs (i)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section may be used as a leading trainset cab in revenue service only until the next pre-service inspection required under the railroad's inspection, testing, and maintenance program.


(4) A trainset with an image recording device that has been taken out of service on only one cab end may be used in revenue service beyond the next pre-service inspection without repair provided the other cab end is the leading end of the trainset and the image recording system is otherwise operative for that cab end.


(5) A trainset with an inoperative image recording device alone is not deemed to be in an improper condition, unsafe to operate, or non-complying under § 299.447. However, a trainset with an entire image record system taken out of service or image recording devices taken out service in both cab ends, may not be used in revenue service beyond the next pre-service inspection required under the railroad's inspection, testing, and maintenance program without repair or replacement of the non-operative system or devices.


(j) *Disabling or interfering with locomotive-mounted audio and video recording equipment.* Any individual who willfully disables or interferes with the intended functioning of image or audio recording system equipment mounted in a leading trainset cab used in revenue service, or who tampers with or alters the data recorded by such equipment, is subject to a civil penalty and to disqualification from performing safety-sensitive functions on a railroad as provided in parts 209 and 218 of this chapter.


(k) *Employee protections.* (1) If inward-facing image or in-cab audio trainset recordings are utilized to conduct operational tests and inspections under § 299.505, the railroad shall adopt and comply with a procedure in its operational tests and inspections program that ensures employees are randomly subject to such operational tests and inspections involving image or audio recordings. The procedure adopted must:


(i) Establish objective, neutral criteria to ensure every employee subject to such operational tests and inspections is selected randomly for such operational tests and inspections within a specified time frame;


(ii) Not permit subjective factors to play a role in selection, *i.e.,* no employee may be selected based on the exercise of the railroad's discretion; and


(iii) Require that any operational test or inspection using trainset image or audio recordings be performed within 72 hours of the completion of the employee's tour of duty that is the subject of the operational test. Any operational test performed more than 72 hours after the completion of the tour of duty that is the subject of the test is a violation of this section. The 72-hour limitation does not apply to investigations of railroad accidents/incidents or to violations of Federal railroad safety laws, regulations, or orders, or any criminal laws.


(2) FRA may review the railroad's procedure implementing paragraph (k)(1) of this section, and, for cause stated, may disapprove such procedure under § 299.505(h).
