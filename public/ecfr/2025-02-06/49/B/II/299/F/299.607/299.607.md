# § 299.607   Pre-revenue service system integration testing.

(a) Prior to commencing revenue operations, the railroad shall conduct tests of the trainsets throughout the system to—


(1) Verify mechanical positioning of the overhead catenary system; and


(2) Verify performance of the trainset, track, and signal and trainset control systems.


(b) The railroad shall demonstrate safe operation of the system during normal and degraded-mode operating conditions. At a minimum, the following operation tests shall be performed:


(1) Slow-speed operation of a trainset;


(2) Verification of correct overhead catenary and pantograph interaction;


(3) Verification of trainset clearance at structures and passenger platforms;


(4) Incremental increase of trainset speed;


(5) Performance tests on trainsets to verify braking rates in accordance with § 299.409;


(6) Verification of vehicle noise;


(7) Verification of correct vehicle suspension characteristics;


(8) Vehicle/track system qualification as defined in § 299.609;


(9) Load tests with vehicles to verify relay settings and signal and communication system immunization;


(10) Monitoring of utility supply circuits and telephone circuits to ensure the adequacy of power supplies, and to verify that transient-related disturbances are within acceptable limits;


(11) Verification of vehicle detection due to shunting of signal system circuits;


(12) Verification of safe operation of the signal and trainset control system as required by subpart B of this part;


(13) Tests of trainset radio reception during system-wide vehicle operation; and


(14) Verification of electromagnetic interference/electromagnetic compatibility between various subsystems.
