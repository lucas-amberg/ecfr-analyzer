# § 325.1   Scope of the rules in this part.

(a) The rules in this part prescribe procedures for inspection, surveillance, and measurement of motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment operated by motor carriers to determine whether those vehicles and that equipment conform to the Interstate Motor Carrier Noise Emission Standards of the Environmental Protection Agency, 40 CFR part 202.


(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the rules in this part apply to motor carriers engaged in interstate commerce. The rules apply at any time or under any condition of highway grade, load, acceleration or deceleration.


(c) The rules in this part do not apply to—


(1) A motor vehicle that has a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) of 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg.) or less;


(2) A combination of motor vehicles that has a Gross Combination Weight Rating (GCWR) of 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg.) or less;


(3) The sound generated by a warning device, such as a horn or siren, installed in a motor vehicle, unless such device is intentionally sounded in order to preclude an otherwise valid noise emission measurement;


(4) An emergency motor vehicle, such as a fire engine, an ambulance, a police van, or a rescue van, when it is responding to an emergency call;


(5) A snow plow in operation; or


(6) The sound generated by auxiliary equipment which is normally operated only when the motor vehicle on which it is installed is stopped or is operating at a speed of 5 miles per hour (8 kph) or less, unless such device is intentionally operated at speeds greater than 5 mph (8 kph) in order to preclude an otherwise valid noise measurement. Examples of that type of auxiliary equipment include, but are not limited to, cranes, asphalt spreaders, ditch diggers, liquid or slurry pumps, auxiliary air compressors, welders, and trash compactors.
