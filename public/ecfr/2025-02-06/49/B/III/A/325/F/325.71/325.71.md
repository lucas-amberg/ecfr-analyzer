# ยง 325.71   Scope of the rules in this subpart.

(a) The rules in this subpart specify correction factors which are added to, or subtracted from, the reading of the sound level generated by a motor vehicle, as displayed on a sound level measurement system, during the measurement of the motor vehicle's sound level emissions at a test site which is not a standard site.


(b) The purpose of adding or subtracting a correction factor is to equate the sound level reading actually generated by the motor vehicle to the sound level reading it would have generated if the measurement had been made at a standard test site.
