# § 350.201   MCSAP administration: Goal and purpose.

(a) *General.* MCSAP is a Federal formula grant program that provides financial assistance to States to reduce the number and severity of crashes, and resulting injuries and fatalities, involving CMVs and to promote the safe transportation of passengers and hazardous materials. The goal of MCSAP is to reduce CMV-involved crashes, fatalities, and injuries through consistent, uniform, and effective CMV safety programs that include driver or vehicle inspections, traffic enforcement, carrier investigations, new entrant safety audits, border enforcement, safety data improvements, and Performance and Registration Information Systems Management (PRISM).


(b) *MCSAP purpose.* The purpose of MCSAP is to ensure FMCSA and States, local government agencies, other political jurisdictions, Federally-recognized Indian Tribes, and other organizations and persons work in partnership to establish programs to improve motor carrier, CMV, and driver safety to support a safe and efficient transportation system by—


(1) Making targeted investments to promote safe CMV transportation, including transportation of passengers and hazardous materials;


(2) Investing in activities likely to generate maximum reductions in the number and severity of CMV crashes and in fatalities resulting from CMV crashes;


(3) Adopting and enforcing effective and compatible (as defined in § 350.105 of this part) motor carrier, CMV, and driver safety laws, regulations, standards, and orders; and


(4) Assessing and improving State-wide performance of motor carrier, CMV, and driver safety by setting program goals and meeting performance standards, measurements, and benchmarks.


(c) *State participation.* MCSAP sets conditions of participation for States and promotes the adoption and uniform enforcement of compatible laws, regulations, standards, and orders on CMV safety.
