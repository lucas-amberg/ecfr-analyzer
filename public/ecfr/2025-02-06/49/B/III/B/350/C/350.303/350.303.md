# § 350.303   Compatibility review: State responsibilities.

(a) *General.* The Lead State Agency is responsible for reviewing and analyzing State laws, regulations, standards, and orders on CMV safety to ensure compatibility (as defined in § 350.105 of this part).


(b) *Compatibility deadline.* As soon as practicable, but no later than 3 years after the effective date of any new addition or amendment to the FMCSRs or HMRs, the State must amend its laws, regulations, standards, and orders to ensure compatibility.


(c) *State adoption of a law, regulation, standard, or order on CMV safety.* A State must submit to FMCSA a copy of any new or amended State law, regulation, standard, or order on CMV safety immediately after its enactment or issuance and with the State's next annual compatibility review.


(d) *Annual State compatibility review.* (1) A State must conduct a review of its laws, regulations, standards, and orders on CMV safety, including those of its political subdivisions, for compatibility and report in the first year of the CVSP or annual update as part of its application for funding under § 350.209 each fiscal year. In conducting this compatibility review, the State must determine which of its laws, regulations, standards, and orders on CMV safety are identical to or have the same effect as, are in addition to or more stringent than, or are less stringent than the FMCSRs or are identical to the HMRs.


(2) As applicable to interstate commerce not involving the movement of hazardous materials:


(i) If a State satisfactorily demonstrates a law, regulation, standard, or order on CMV safety is identical to or has the same effect as the FMCSRs, the State provision is compatible and enforceable.


(ii) If a State satisfactorily demonstrates a law, regulation, standard, or order on CMV safety that is in addition to or more stringent than the FMCSRs has a safety benefit, does not unreasonably frustrate the Federal goal of uniformity, and does not cause an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce when enforced, the State provision is compatible and enforceable.


(iii) If a State law, regulation, standard, or order on CMV safety is less stringent than the FMCSRs, the State provision is not compatible and not enforceable.


(3) As applicable to intrastate commerce not involving the movement of hazardous materials:


(i) If a State satisfactorily demonstrates a law, regulation, standard, or order on CMV safety is identical to or has the same effect as the FMCSRs, the State provision is compatible and enforceable.


(ii) If a State satisfactorily demonstrates a law, regulation, standard, or order on CMV safety that is in addition to, more stringent than, or less stringent than the FMCSRs falls within a limited variance from the FMCSRs allowed under § 350.305 or § 350.307, the State provision is compatible and enforceable.


(4) As applicable to interstate and intrastate commerce involving the movement of hazardous materials, if a State satisfactorily demonstrates a law, regulation, standard, or order on CMV safety is identical to the HMRs, the State provision is compatible and enforceable.


(5) The State's laws, regulations, standards, and orders on CMV safety reviewed for the commercial driver's license compliance report are excluded from the compatibility review.


(6) Definitions of words or terms in a State's laws, regulations, standards, and orders on CMV safety must be compatible with those in the FMCSRs and HMRs.


(e) *Reporting to FMCSA.* (1) The reporting required by paragraph (d) of this section, to be submitted with the first year of the CVSP or annual update, must include:


(i) A copy of any State law, regulation, standard, or order on CMV safety that was adopted or amended since the State's last report; and


(ii) A certification that states the annual review was performed and State laws, regulations, standards, and orders on CMV safety remain compatible, and that provides the name of the individual responsible for the annual review.


(2) If State laws, regulations, standards, and orders on CMV safety are no longer compatible, the certifying official must explain the State's plan to correct the discrepancy.


(f) *FMCSA response.* Not later than 10 days after FMCSA determines that a State law, regulation, standard, or order on CMV safety is not compatible and may not be enforced, FMCSA must give written notice of the decision to the State.


(g) *Waiver of determination.* (1) A State or any person may petition the Administrator for a waiver of a decision by the Administrator that a State law, regulation, standard, or order on CMV safety is not compatible and may not be enforced.


(2) Before deciding whether to grant or deny a waiver under this paragraph, the Administrator shall give the petitioner an opportunity for a hearing on the record.


(3) If the petitioner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the waiver is consistent with the public interest and the safe operation of CMVs, the Administrator shall grant the waiver as expeditiously as practicable.
