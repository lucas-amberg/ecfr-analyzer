FMCSA will only consider a State's request to exempt a specific industry from all or part of a State's laws or regulations applicable to intrastate commerce if the State submits adequate documentation containing information allowing FMCSA to evaluate:


(a) The type and scope of the industry exemption request, including the percentage of the industry it affects, number of vehicles, mileage traveled, and number of companies it involves;


(b) The type and scope of the requirement to which the exemption would apply;


(c) The safety performance of that specific industry (*e.g.,* crash frequency, rates, and comparative figures);


(d) Inspection information (*e.g.,* number of violations per inspection, and driver and vehicle out-of-service information);


(e) Other CMV safety regulations enforced by other State agencies not participating in MCSAP;


(f) The commodity the industry transports (*e.g.,* livestock or grain);


(g) Similar exemptions granted and the circumstances under which they were granted;


(h) The justification for the exemption; and
