# § 372.109   Computation of tonnage allowable in nonfarm-non-member transportation.

Interstate transportation performed by a cooperative association or federation of cooperative associations for nonmembers who are not farmers, cooperative associations, or federations of associations or the United States Government for compensation, (except transportation otherwise exempt under subtitle IV, part B, chapter 135 of title 49 of the United States Code) shall be limited to that which is incidental to its primary transportation operation and necessary for its effective performance. It shall in no event exceed 25 percent of its total interstate transportation services in any fiscal year, measured in terms of tonnage. A cooperative association or federation of cooperative associations may transport its own property, its members' property, property of other farmers and the property of other cooperatives or federations in accordance with existing law, except where the provisions of § 372.111 may be applicable to the limit on member/nonmember transportation.


(a) The phrase “incidental to its primary transportation operation and necessary for its effective performance” means that the interstate transportation of the cooperative association or federation of cooperative associations for nonmembers as described above is performed with the same trucks or tractors employed in a prior or subsequent trip in the primary transportation operation of the cooperative association or federation, that it is not economically feasible to operate the trucks or tractors empty on return trips (outbound trips in cases where the primary transportation operation is inbound to the association or federation), and that the additional income obtained from such transportation is necessary to make the primary transportation operation financially practicable. Transportation for nonmembers as described above performed by a cooperative or federation through the use of trucks or tractors trip-leased for one-way movements with the cooperative association or federation acting as leasee, is not incidental and necessary;


(b) The base tonnage to which the 25-percent limitation is applied is all tonnage of all kinds transported by the cooperative association or federation of cooperative associations in interstate or foreign commerce, whether for itself, its members or nonmembers, for or on behalf of the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof, and that performed within the exemption provided by 49 U.S.C. 13506(a)(5).
