# ยง 375.709   If a shipment is totally lost or destroyed, what charges may I collect at delivery?

(a) You are forbidden from collecting, or requiring an individual shipper to pay, any freight charges (including any charges for accessorial or terminal services) when a household goods shipment is *totally lost or destroyed* in transit. The following two conditions also apply:


(1) You must collect any specific valuation charge due.


(2) You may disregard paragraph (a) of this section if loss or destruction was due to an act or omission of the individual shipper.


(b) The individual shipper's rights are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights the individual shipper may have with respect to a shipment of household goods you or your agent(s) totally lost or destroyed in transit. This applies whether or not the individual shipper exercises its rights provided in paragraph (a) of this section.
