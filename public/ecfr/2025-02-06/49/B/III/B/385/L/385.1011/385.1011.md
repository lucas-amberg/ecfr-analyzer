(5) Informs the motor carrier of the address and name of the person to whom the response should be directed and served; and


(6) Informs the motor carrier that its registration may be revoked on the 35th day after service of the order issued under this section if the motor carrier has not demonstrated, in writing, compliance with any order directing compliance, or otherwise shown good cause why compliance is not required or the registration should not be revoked.
