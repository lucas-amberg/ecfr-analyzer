(a) Applications for the issuance of subpoenas must be submitted to the Agency Decisionmaker, or in cases that have been called for a hearing, to the administrative law judge. The application must show the general relevance and reasonable scope of the evidence sought. Any person served with a subpoena may, within 7 days after service, file a motion to quash or modify. The motion must be filed with the official who approved the subpoena. The filing of a motion shall stay the effect of the subpoena until a decision is reached.

Applications for the attendance of such persons or the production of such documents at a hearing shall be made to the Agency Decisionmaker or administrative law judge, if one is appointed, and shall set forth the need for such evidence and its relevancy.
