# § 389.13   Initiation of rulemaking.

(a) The Administrator may recommend the initiation of a rulemaking to the Office of the Secretary on his/her own motion. However, in so doing, he/she may, in his/her discretion, consider the recommendations of his/her staff or other agencies of the United States or of other interested persons.


(b) If a proposed rule regarding commercial motor vehicle safety is likely to lead to the promulgation of a major rule, the Administrator, before publishing such proposed rule, shall—


(1) Issue an advance notice of proposed rulemaking that:


(i) Identifies the need for a potential regulatory action;


(ii) Identifies and requests public comment on the best available science or technical information relevant to analyzing potential regulatory alternatives;


(iii) Requests public comment on the available data, benefits, and costs with respect to regulatory alternatives reasonably likely to be considered as part of the rulemaking; and


(iv) Requests public comment on available alternatives to regulation; or


(2) Proceed with a negotiated rulemaking.


(c) Paragraph (b) of this section does not apply to a proposed rule if the Administrator, for good cause, finds (and incorporates the finding and a brief statement of reasons for such finding in the proposed or final rule) that an advance notice of proposed rulemaking is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.
