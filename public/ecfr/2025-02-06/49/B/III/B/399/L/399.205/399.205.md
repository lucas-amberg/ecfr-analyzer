*Cab-over-engine (COE)* A truck or truck-tractor having all, or the front portion, of the engine under the cab.


*COE—High profile* A COE having the door sill step above the height of the front tires.


*Deck plate* A horizontal surface designed to provide a person with stable footing for the performance of work such as the connection and disconnection of air and electrical lines, gaining access to permanently-mounted equipment or machinery or for similar needs.


*Door sill step* Any step normally protected from the elements by the cab door when closed.


*Effective peripheral grip* Any shaped surface, free of sharp edges, in which a full grasp can be made to secure a handhold by a person.


*Fingertip grasp* A handhold surface which provides a person contact restricted to finger segments 1 and/or 2 only; or which limits wrap-around closure of finger segment 1 with the palm of the hand to 90 degrees as shown in Illustration I.


*Full grasp* A handhold surface which provides a person contact with finger segments 2 and 3 and which provides space for finger segment 1 to wrap around toward the palm of the hand beyond the 90-degree surface restriction shown in Illustration I. The handhold need not require contact between fingers and thumb. For example, the hand position shown in Illustration II qualifies as full grasp.


*Ground* The flat horizontal surface on which the tires of a motor vehicle rest.


*Handhold* That which qualifies as providing full grasp if a person is able to find a hand position on the handhold which allows more than fingertip grasp.


*Handprint* The surface area contacted by the hand when grasping a handhold. The size of this area is the width of the hand across the metacarpal and half the circumference of the handhold. The hand breadth of the typical person is 88.9 millimeters (3.5 inches).
