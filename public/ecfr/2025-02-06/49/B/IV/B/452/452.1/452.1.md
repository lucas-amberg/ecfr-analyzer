# ยง 452.1   Periodic examination required.

(a) Except as provided for in ยง 452.7, each owner of an approved container subject to this part shall examine the container or have it examined in accordance with the procedures prescribed in ยง 452.3 at intervals of not more than 30 months, except that for containers approved as new containers, the interval from the date of manufacture to the date of the first examination must not exceed five years. For containers approved, examined and plated as existing containers before January 1, 1985 and containers approved and plated as new containers before January 1, 1985, the subsequent examination must be carried out in accordance with the following schedule:


(b) Upon completion of an examination required by this part, the owner shall mark on the safety approval plate, or on the container itself as close as practicable to the safety approval plate, the month and year before which the container must next be examined. This marking must be on all containers by January 1, 1987. The marking may be by a decal, sticker, stencil, or other means so long as it is capable of remaining legible for at least 24 months. Affixing such a marking to a container that has not been examined in accordance with ยง 452.3 constitutes a misrepresentation in a matter within the jurisdiction of an agency of the United States, and makes the owner punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001.


(c) The owner of containers subject to this section shall have those containers examined in accordance with the program prescribed in this section regardless of whether the examinations are preformed within or outside the United States.
