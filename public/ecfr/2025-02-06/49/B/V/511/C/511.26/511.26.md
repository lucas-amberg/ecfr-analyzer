# ยง 511.26   Settlement.

(a) *Applicability.* This section applies only to cases of alleged violations of section 507(3) of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act, Pub. L. 94-163, 89 Stat. 911 (15 U.S.C. section 2007(3)). Settlement in other cases may be made only in accordance with subpart G of this part.


(b) *Availability.* Any party shall have the opportunity to submit an offer of settlement to the Presiding Officer.


(c) *Form.* Offers of settlement shall be in the form of a consent agreement and order, shall be signed by the party submitting the offer or his representative, and may be signed by any other party. Each offer of settlement shall be accompanied by a motion to transmit to the Administrator the proposed agreement and order, outlining the substantive provisions of the agreement, and the reasons why it should be accepted.


(d) *Contents.* The proposed consent agreement and order which constitute the offer of settlement shall contain the following:


(1) An admission of all jurisdictional facts;


(2) An express waiver of further procedural steps, and of all rights to seek judicial review or otherwise to contest the validity of the order;


(3) A description of the alleged noncompliance, or violation;


(4) Provisions to the effect that the allegations of the complaint are resolved by the proposed consent agreement and order;


(5) A listing of the acts or practices from which the respondent shall refrain;


(6) A detailed statement of the corrective action(s) which the respondent shall excute and the civil penalty, if any, that respondent shall pay.


(e) *Transmittal.* The Presiding Officer shall transmit to the Administrator for decision all offers of settlement and accompanying memoranda that meet the requirements enumerated in paragraph (d) of this section. The Presiding Officer may, but need not, recommend acceptance or rejection of such offers. Any party or participant may object to a proposed consent agreement by filing a motion and supporting memorandum with the Administrator.


(f) *Stay of proceedings.* When an offer of settlement has been agreed to by the parties and has been transmitted to the Administrator, the proceedings shall be stayed until the Administrator has ruled on the offer. When an offer of settlement has been made and transmitted to the Administrator but has not been agreed to by all parties, the proceedings shall not be stayed pending the Administrator's decision on the offer.


(g) *Administrator's ruling.* The Administrator will rule upon all transmitted offers of settlement. If the Administrator accepts the offer, the Administrator shall issue an appropriate order. The order shall become effective upon issuance. In determining whether to accept an offer of settlement, the Administrator will consider the gravity of the alleged violation, and any good faith efforts by the respondent to comply with applicable requirements.


(h) *Rejection.* If the Administrator rejects an offer of settlement, the Administrator shall give written notice of that decision and the reasons therefor to the parties and the Presiding Officer. Promptly thereafter, the Presiding Officer shall issue an order notifying the parties of the resumption of the proceedings, including any modifications to the schedule resulting from the stay of the proceedings.


(i) *Effect of rejected offer.* Rejected offers of settlement shall not be admissible in evidence over the objection of any signatory, nor shall the fact of the proposal of the offer be admissible in evidence.
