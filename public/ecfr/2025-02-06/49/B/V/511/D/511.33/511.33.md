# § 511.33   Production of documents and things.

(a) *Scope.* Any party may serve upon any other party a request (1) to produce and permit the party making the request, or someone acting on behalf of that party, to inspect and copy any designated documents (including writings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, phono-records, and any other data-compilation from which information can be obtained, translated, if necessary, by the party in possession into reasonably usable form), or (2) to inspect and copy, test or sample tangible things which constitute or contain matters within the scope of § 511.31(c)(1) and which are in the possession, custody or control of the party upon whom the request is served.


(b) *Procedure for request.* The request may be served at any time after the filing of the answer without leave of the Presiding Officer. The request shall set forth the items to be inspected either by individual item or by category, and shall describe each item or category with reasonable particularity. The request shall specify a reasonable time, place and manner for making the inspection and performing the related acts.


(c) *Procedure for response.* The party upon whom the request is served shall serve a written response within twenty (20) days after service of the request. The Presiding Officer may allow a shorter or longer time for response. The response shall state, with respect to each item or category requested, that inspection and related activities will be permitted as requested, unless the request is objected to, in which event the reasons for objection shall be stated. If objection is made to only part of an item or category, that part shall be so specified. The party submitting the request may move for an order under § 511.36 with respect to any objection to or other failure to respond to the request or any part thereof, or to any failure to permit inspection as requested.
