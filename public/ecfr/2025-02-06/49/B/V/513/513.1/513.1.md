# ยง 513.1   General.

This part 513 describes the whistleblower program established by the Agency to implement the Motor Vehicle Safety Whistleblower Act, 49 U.S.C. 30172, explains procedures that a potential whistleblower must follow to be eligible for an award, and the circumstances under which information that may reasonably be expected to reveal the identity of a whistleblower may be disclosed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Potential whistleblowers should read these procedures carefully because failure to take required steps in a timely fashion in conformance with these rules may result in disqualification from receiving an award. Questions about the whistleblower program or these rules should be directed to the NHTSA Office of the Chief Counsel at *NHTSAWhistleblower@dot.gov*. Unless expressly provided for in this part, no person is authorized to make any offer or promise, or otherwise bind the Agency with respect to the payment of any award or the amount thereof, and any such offer or promise will not be honored.
