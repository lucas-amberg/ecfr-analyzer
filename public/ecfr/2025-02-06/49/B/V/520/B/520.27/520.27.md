# § 520.27   Legislative actions.

(a) A DEIS on both legislative proposals and reports for which NHTSA either develops the Departmental position or originates the legislation will be cleared with TES, filed with CEQ, and submitted to the Office of Management and Budget through the normal DOT and NHTSA legislative process.


(b) The preparation, circulation, and filing of the environmental statement shall be in accordance with OMB Bulletin 72-6, “Proposed Federal Actions Affecting the Environment.”


(c) A DEIS and any comments that have been received should be available to the Congress and to the public for consideration in connection with the proposed legislation or report on proposed legislation. In cases where the scheduling of Congressional hearings on recommendations or reports on proposals for legislation which the Department has forwarded to the Congress does not allow adequate time for the completion of a FEIS, a DEIS may be furnished to the Congress and made available to the public pending transmittal of the comments as received and the final text.
