# ยง 520.30   Availability of final environmental impact statements.

(a) Pending final approval and filing with CEQ, a proposed FEIS may be made available to the public and Federal, State, or local agencies if it carries a notation that it is not approved and filed.


(b) After approval by the Administrator, the Associate Administrator for Planning and Evaluation will send 5 copies of the FEIS (together with comments) to the CEQ; individual copies with comments attached to the EPA and all Federal, State, and local agencies and members of the public who submitted comments on the DEIS or requested copies of the FEIS. If the length of the statement or the number of comments make this distribution requirement highly impractical, TES should be consulted to consider an alternative arrangement.


(c) Copies of the FEIS will be made available in the NHTSA Docket Section, Room 5109, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590, and, where appropriate, NHTSA Regional Offices, at the offices of any applicants or grantees, and at appropriate State, regional, and metropolitan clearinghouses and, where the impact is localized, public libraries.


(d) The official responsible for the action shall, upon request, make available copies of the FEIS and substantive comments received on the DEIS without charge to the extent practicable, or at a fee which is not more than the actual cost of reproducing copies.
