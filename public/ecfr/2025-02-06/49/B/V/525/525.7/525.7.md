# § 525.7   Basis for petition.

(a) The petitioner shall include the information specified in paragraphs (b) through (h) in its petition.


(b) Whether the petitioner controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another manufacturer of passenger automobiles, and if so, the nature of that control relationship, and the total number of passenger automobiles manufactured by such other manufacturer or manufacturers.


(c) The total number of passenger automobiles manufactured or likely to be manufactured (whether or not in the customs territory of the United States) by the petitioner in the second model year immediately preceding each affected model year.


(d) For each affected model year, the petitioner's projections of the most fuel efficient production mix of vehicle configurations and base levels of its passenger automobiles which the petitioner could sell in that model year, and a discussion demonstrating that these projections are reasonable. The discussion shall include information showing that the projections are consistent with—


(1) The petitioner's annual total production and production mix of passenger automobiles manufactured or likely to be manufactured in each of the four model years immediately preceding that affected model year;


(2) Its passenger automobile production capacity for that affected model year;


(3) Its efforts to comply with that average fuel economy standard; and


(4) Anticipated consumer demand in the United States for passenger automobiles during that affected model year.


(e) For each affected model year, a description of the following features of each vehicle configuration of the petitioner's passenger automobiles to be manufactured in that affected model year;


(1) Maximum overall body width, overall length, and overall height, determined in accordance with Motor Vehicle Dimensions SAE J1100a (report of Human Engineering Committee, approved September 1973, as revised September 1975);


(2) Vehicle curb weight;


(3) Number of designated seating positions and interior volume index;


(4) Basic engine, displacement, and SAE rated net power, kilowatts;


(5) Fuel metering system, including the number of carburetor barrels, if applicable;


(6) Drive train configuration and total drive ratio;


(7) Emission control system;


(8) Dynamometer road load setting, determined in accordance with 40 CFR part 86, and the method used to determine that setting, including information indicating whether the road load setting was adjusted to account for the presence of air conditioning and whether the setting was based on the use of radial ply tires; and


(9) Use of synthetic lubricants, low viscosity lubricants, or lubricants with additives that affect friction characteristics in the crankcase, differential, and transmission of the vehicles tested under the requirements of 40 CFR parts 86 and 600. With respect to automobiles which will use these lubricants, indicate which one will be used and explain why that type was chosen. With respect to automobiles which will not use these lubricants, explain the reasons for not so doing.


(f) For each affected model year, a fuel economy value for each vehicle configuration specified in 40 CFR 600.506(a)(2), base level, and model type of the petitioner's passenger automobiles to be manufactured in that affected model year calculated in accordance with subpart C of 40 CFR part 600 and based on tests or analyses comparable to those prescribed or permitted under 40 CFR part 600 and a description of the test procedures or analytical methods.


(g) For each affected model year, an average fuel economy figure for the petitioner's passenger automobiles to be manufactured in that affected model year calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 600.510(e) and based upon the fuel economy values provided under paragraph (f) of this section and upon the petitioner's production mix projected under paragraph (d) of this section for the affected model year.


(h) Information demonstrating that the average fuel economy figure provided for each affected model year under paragraph (g) of this section is the maximum feasible average fuel economy achievable by the petitioner for that model year, including—


(1) For each affected model year and each of the two model years immediately following the first affected model year, a description of the technological means selected by the petitioner for improving the average fuel economy of its automobiles to be manufactured in that model year.


(2) A chronological description of the petitioner's past and planned efforts to implement the means described under paragraph (h)(1) of this section.


(3) A description of the effect of other Federal motor vehicle standards on the fuel economy of the petitioner's automobiles.


(4) For each affected model year, a discussion of the alternative and additional means considered but not selected by the petitioner that would have enabled its passenger automobiles to achieve a higher average fuel economy than is achievable with the means described under paragraph (h)(1) of this section. This discussion must include an explanation of the reasons the petitioner had for rejecting these additional and alternative means.


(5) In the case of a petitioner which plans to increase the average fuel economy of its passenger automobiles to be manufactured in either of the two model years immediately following the first affected model year, an explanation of the petitioner's reasons for not making those increases in that affected model year.
