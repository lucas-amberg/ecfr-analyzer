(1) For tractors and vocational vehicles with a date of manufacture on or after January 1, 2021, the vehicle's *model year* is the calendar year corresponding to the date of manufacture; however, the vehicle's model year may be designated to be the year before the calendar year corresponding to the date of manufacture if the engine's model year is also from an earlier year. Note that paragraph (2) of this definition limits the extent to which vehicle manufacturers may install engines built in earlier calendar years. Note that 40 CFR 1037.601(a)(2) limits the extent to which vehicle manufacturers may install engines built in earlier calendar years.


(2) For Phase 1 tractors and vocational vehicles with a date of manufacture before January 1, 2021, *model year* means the manufacturer's annual new model production period, except as restricted under this definition. It must include January 1 of the calendar year for which the model year is named, may not begin before January 2 of the previous calendar year, and it must end by December 31 of the named calendar year. The model year may be set to match the calendar year corresponding to the date of manufacture.


(i) The manufacturer who holds the certificate of conformity for the vehicle must assign the model year based on the date when its manufacturing operations are completed relative to its annual model year period. In unusual circumstances where completion of your assembly is delayed, we may allow you to assign a model year one year earlier, provided it does not affect which regulatory requirements will apply.


(ii) Unless a vehicle is being shipped to a secondary manufacturer that will hold the certificate of conformity, the model year must be assigned prior to introduction of the vehicle into U.S. commerce. The certifying manufacturer must re-designate the model year if it does not complete its manufacturing operations within the originally identified model year. A vehicle introduced into U.S. commerce without a model year is deemed to have a model year equal to the calendar year of its introduction into U.S. commerce unless the certifying manufacturer assigns a later date.


(3) For engines, *model year* means the manufacturer's annual new model production period, except as restricted under this definition. It must include January 1 of the calendar year for which the model year is named, may not begin before January 2 of the previous calendar year, and it must end by December 31 of the named calendar year.

*Payload* means in this part the resultant of subtracting the curb weight from the gross vehicle weight rating.


*Percent (%)* means a representation of exactly 0.01. Numbers expressed as percentages in this part (such as a tolerance of ±2%) have infinite precision, so 2% and 2.000000000% have the same meaning. This means that where we specify some percentage of a total value, the calculated value has the same number of significant digits as the total value. For example, 2% of a span value where the span value is 101.3302 is 2.026604. (See 40 CFR 1037.801 and 40 CFR 1065.1001.

*Test group* means the multiple vehicle lines and model types that share critical emissions and fuel consumption related features and that are certified as a group by a common certificate of conformity issued by EPA and is used collectively with other test groups within an averaging set or regulatory subcategory and is used by NHTSA for determining the fleet average fuel consumption.


*The agencies* means the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in this part.


*Tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS)* has the meaning given in section S3 of 49 CFR 571.138.


*Tire rolling resistance level (TRRL)* means a value with units of kg/metric ton that represents that rolling resistance of a tire configuration. TRRLs are used as inputs to the GEM model under 40 CFR 1037.520. Note that a manufacturer may assign a value higher than a measured rolling resistance of a tire configuration.


*Towing capacity* in this part is equal to the resultant of subtracting the gross vehicle weight rating from the gross combined weight rating.


*Trade* means to exchange fuel consumption credits, either as a buyer or a seller.


*U.S.-directed production volume* means the number of vehicle units, subject to the requirements of this part, produced by a manufacturer for which the manufacturer has a reasonable assurance that sale was or will be made to ultimate purchasers in the United States.


*Useful life* has the meaning given in 40 CFR 1036.801 and 1037.801.


*Vehicle configuration* means a unique combination of vehicle hardware and calibration (related to measured or modeled emissions) within a vehicle family as specified in 40 CFR 1037.801. Vehicles with hardware or software differences, but that have no hardware or software differences related to measured or modeled emissions or fuel consumption can be included in the same vehicle configuration. Note that vehicles with hardware or software differences related to measured or modeled emissions or fuel consumption are considered to be different configurations even if they have the same GEM inputs and FEL. Vehicles within a vehicle configuration differ only with respect to normal production variability or factors unrelated to measured or modeled emissions and fuel consumption for EPA and NHTSA.


*Vehicle family* has the meaning given in 40 CFR 1037.230. Manufacturers designate families in accordance with EPA provisions and may not choose different families between the NHTSA and EPA programs. If a manufacturer is certifying vehicles within a vehicle family to more than one FEL, it must subdivide its greenhouse gas and fuel consumption vehicle families into subfamilies that include vehicles with identical FELs. Note that a manufacturer may add subfamilies at any time during the model year.


*Vehicle identification number* has the meaning given in 49 CFR 565.12 for *VIN.*

*Vehicle service class* means classes of vehicles, generally based on a vehicle's weight class, that are used for purposes of determining applicable requirements. The *vehicle service classes* defined here for use in this part align with the *vehicle service classes* specified in 40 CFR 1037.140(g). Fuel consumption standards and other provisions of this part apply to specific vehicle service classes for tractors and vocational vehicles as follows:


(1) Phase 1 and Phase 2 tractors are divided based on GVWR into Class 7 tractors and Class 8 tractors. Where provisions apply to both tractors and vocational vehicles, Class 7 tractors are considered medium heavy-duty “MHD” vehicles and Class 8 tractors are considered heavy heavy-duty “HHD” vehicles. This paragraph applies for both hybrid and non-hybrid vehicles.


(2) Phase 1 vocational vehicles are divided based on GVWR. Light heavy-duty “LHD” vehicles includes Class 2b through Class 5 vehicles; medium heavy-duty “MHD” vehicles includes Class 6 and Class 7 vehicles; and heavy heavy-duty “HHD” vehicles includes Class 8 vehicles.


(3) Phase 2 vocational vehicles with spark-ignition engines are divided based on GVWR. Light heavy-duty “LHD” vehicles includes Class 2b through Class 5 vehicles, and medium heavy-duty “MHD” vehicles includes Class 6 through Class 8 vehicles.


(4) Phase 2 vocational vehicles with compression-ignition engines are divided as follows:


(i) Class 2b through Class 5 vehicles are considered light heavy-duty “LHD” vehicles.


(ii) Class 6 through 8 vehicles are considered heavy heavy-duty “HHD” vehicles if the installed engine's primary intended service class is heavy heavy-duty (see 40 CFR 1036.140), except that Class 8 hybrid vehicles are considered heavy heavy-duty “HHD” vehicles regardless of the engine's primary intended service class. All other Class 6 through Class 8 vehicles are considered medium heavy-duty “MHD” vehicles.


(5) Heavy-duty vehicles with no installed propulsion engine, such as electric vehicles, are divided as follows:


(i) Class 2b through Class 5 vehicles are considered light heavy-duty “LHD” vehicles.


(ii) Class 6 and 7 vehicles are considered medium heavy-duty “MHD” vehicles.


(iii) Class 8 vehicles are considered heavy heavy-duty “HHD” vehicles.


(6) In certain circumstances, manufacturers may certify vehicles to standards that apply for a different vehicle service class such as allowed in § 535.5(b)(6) and (c)(7). If manufacturers optionally certify vehicles to different standards, those vehicles are subject to all the regulatory requirements as if the standards were mandatory.


*Vehicle subfamily or subfamily* means a subset of a vehicle family including vehicles subject to the same FEL(s).


*Vocational tractor* has the meaning given in 40 CFR 1037.801.


*Zero emissions vehicle* means an electric vehicle or a fuel cell vehicle.
