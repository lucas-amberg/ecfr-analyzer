# § 536.3   Definitions.

(a) *Statutory terms.* All terms defined in 49 U.S.C. 32901(a) are used pursuant to their statutory meaning.


(b) *Other terms.* (1) *Above standard fuel economy* means, with respect to a compliance category, that the automobiles manufactured by a manufacturer in that compliance category in a particular model year have greater average fuel economy (calculated in a manner that reflects the incentives for alternative fuel automobiles per 49 U.S.C. 32905) than that manufacturer's fuel economy standard for that compliance category and model year.


(2) *Adjustment factor* means a factor used to adjust the value of a traded or transferred credit for compliance purposes to ensure that the compliance value of the credit when used reflects the total volume of oil saved when the credit was earned.


(3) *Below standard fuel economy* means, with respect to a compliance category, that the automobiles manufactured by a manufacturer in that compliance category in a particular model year have lower average fuel economy (calculated in a manner that reflects the incentives for alternative fuel automobiles per 49 U.S.C. 32905) than that manufacturer's fuel economy standard for that compliance category and model year.


(4) *Compliance* means a manufacturer achieves compliance in a particular compliance category when:


(i) The average fuel economy of the vehicles in that category exceed or meet the fuel economy standard for that category; or


(ii) The average fuel economy of the vehicles in that category do not meet the fuel economy standard for that category, but the manufacturer proffers a sufficient number of valid credits, adjusted for total oil savings, to cover the gap between the average fuel economy of the vehicles in that category and the required average fuel economy. A manufacturer achieves compliance for its fleet if the conditions in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section or this paragraph (b)(4)(ii) are simultaneously met for all compliance categories.


(5) *Compliance category* means any of three categories of automobiles subject to Federal fuel economy regulations in this chapter. The three compliance categories recognized by 49 U.S.C. 32903(g)(6) are domestically manufactured passenger automobiles, imported passenger automobiles, and non-passenger automobiles (“light trucks”).


(6) *Credit holder (or holder)* means a legal person that has valid possession of credits, either because they are a manufacturer who has earned credits by exceeding an applicable fuel economy standard in this chapter, or because they are a designated recipient who has received credits from another holder. Credit holders need not be manufacturers, although all manufacturers may be credit holders.


(7) *Credits (or fuel economy credits)* means an earned or purchased allowance recognizing that the average fuel economy of a particular manufacturer's vehicles within a particular compliance category and model year exceeds that manufacturer's fuel economy standard for that compliance category and model year. One credit is equal to 
1/10 of a mile per gallon above the fuel economy standard per one vehicle within a compliance category. Credits are denominated according to model year in which they are earned (vintage), originating manufacturer, and compliance category.


(8) *Expiry date* means the model year after which fuel economy credits may no longer be used to achieve compliance with fuel economy regulations in this chapter. Expiry dates are calculated in terms of model years: For example, if a manufacturer earns credits for model year 2011, these credits may be used for compliance in model years 2008-2016.


(9) *Fleet* means all automobiles that are manufactured by a manufacturer in a particular model year and are subject to fuel economy standards under parts 531 and 533 of this chapter. For the purposes of this part, a manufacturer's fleet means all domestically manufactured and imported passenger automobiles and non-passenger automobiles (“light trucks”). “Work trucks” and medium and heavy trucks are not included in this definition for purposes of this part.


(10) *Light truck* means the same as “non-passenger automobile,” as that term is defined in 49 U.S.C. 32901(a)(17), and as “light truck,” as that term is defined at § 523.5 of this chapter.


(11) *Originating manufacturer* means the manufacturer that originally earned a particular credit. Each credit earned will be identified with the name of the originating manufacturer.


(12) *Trade* means the receipt by the National Highway Traffic Administration (NHTSA) of an instruction from a credit holder to place one of its credits in the account of another credit holder. A credit that has been traded can be identified because the originating manufacturer will be a different party than the current credit holder. Traded credits are moved from one credit holder to the recipient credit holder within the same compliance category for which the credits were originally earned. If a credit has been traded to another credit holder and is subsequently traded back to the originating manufacturer, it will be deemed not to have been traded for compliance purposes.


(13) *Transfer* means the application by a manufacturer of credits earned by that manufacturer in one compliance category or credits acquired be trade (and originally earned by another manufacturer in that category) to achieve compliance with fuel economy standards with respect to a different compliance category. For example, a manufacturer may purchase light truck credits from another manufacturer, and transfer them to achieve compliance in the manufacturer's domestically manufactured passenger car fleet. Subject to the credit transfer limitations of 49 U.S.C. 32903(g)(3), credits can also be transferred across compliance categories and banked or saved in that category to be carried forward or backwards later to address a credit shortfall.


(14) *Vintage* means, with respect to a credit, the model year in which the credit was earned.
