# § 554.8   Monthly reports.

(a) *Compliance.* A monthly compliance report is issued which lists investigations opened, closed, and pending during that month, identifies compliance test reports accepted, and indicates how individual reports may be obtained.


(b) *Defects.* A monthly defects report is issued which lists investigations opened, closed, pending, and suspended during that month. An investigation may be designated “suspended” where the information available is insufficient to warrant further investigation. Suspended cases are automatically closed 60 days after appearing in a monthly report unless new information is received which justifies a different disposition.
