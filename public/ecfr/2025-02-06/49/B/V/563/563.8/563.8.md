# § 563.8   Data format.

(a) The data elements listed in Tables I and II, as applicable, must be reported in accordance with the range, accuracy, and resolution specified in Table III. 


(b) Acceleration Time-History data and format: the longitudinal, lateral, and normal acceleration time-history data, as applicable, must be filtered either during the recording phase or during the data downloading phase to include:


(1) The Time Step (TS) that is the inverse of the sampling frequency of the acceleration data and which has units of seconds;


(2) The number of the first point (NFP), which is an integer that when multiplied by the TS equals the time relative to time zero of the first acceleration data point;


(3) The number of the last point (NLP), which is an integer that when multiplied by the TS equals the time relative to time zero of the last acceleration data point; and


(4) NLP—NFP + 1 acceleration values sequentially beginning with the acceleration at time NFP * TS and continue sampling the acceleration at TS increments in time until the time NLP * TS is reached.
