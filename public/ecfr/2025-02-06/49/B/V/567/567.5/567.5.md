# § 567.5   Requirements for manufacturers of vehicles manufactured in two or more stages.

(a) *Location of information labels for incomplete vehicles.* Each incomplete vehicle manufacturer or intermediate vehicle manufacturer shall permanently affix a label to each incomplete vehicle, in the location and form specified in § 567.4, and in a manner that does not obscure other labels. If the locations specified in 49 CFR 567.4(c) are not practicable, the label may be provided as part of the IVD package so that it can be permanently affixed in the acceptable locations provided for in that subsection when the vehicle is sufficiently manufactured to allow placement in accordance therewith.


(b) *Incomplete vehicle manufacturers.* (1) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section and notwithstanding the certification of a final-stage manufacturer under 49 CFR 567.5(d)(2)(v), each manufacturer of an incomplete vehicle assumes legal responsibility for all certification-related duties and liabilities under the Vehicle Safety Act with respect to:


(i) Components and systems it installs or supplies for installation on the incomplete vehicle, unless changed by a subsequent manufacturer;


(ii) The vehicle as further manufactured or completed by an intermediate or final-stage manufacturer, to the extent that the vehicle is completed in accordance with the IVD; and


(iii) The accuracy of the information contained in the IVD.


(2) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, each incomplete vehicle manufacturer shall affix an information label to each incomplete vehicle that contains the following statements:


(i) Name of incomplete vehicle manufacturer preceded by the words “incomplete vehicle MANUFACTURED BY” or “incomplete vehicle MFD BY”.


(ii) Month and year of manufacture of the incomplete vehicle. This may be spelled out, as in “JUNE 2000”, or expressed in numerals, as in “6/00”. No preface is required.


(iii) “Gross Vehicle Weight Rating” or “GVWR” followed by the appropriate value in kilograms and (pounds), which shall not be less than the sum of the unloaded vehicle weight, rated cargo load, and 150 pounds times the number of the vehicle's designated seating positions, if known. However, for school buses the minimum occupant weight allowance shall be 120 pounds per passenger and 150 pounds for the driver.


(iv) “Gross Axle Weight Rating” or “GAWR,” followed by the appropriate value in kilograms and (pounds) for each axle, identified in order from front to rear (e.g., front, first intermediate, second intermediate, rear). The ratings for any consecutive axles having identical gross axle weight ratings when equipped with tires having the same tire size designation may be stated as a single value, with the label indicating to which axles the ratings apply.


(v) Vehicle Identification Number.


(c) *Intermediate manufacturers.* (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section and notwithstanding the certification of a final-stage manufacturer under § 567.5(d)(2)(v), each intermediate manufacturer of a vehicle manufactured in two or more stages assumes legal responsibility for all certification-related duties and liabilities under the Vehicle Safety Act with respect to:


(i) Components and systems it installs or supplies for installation on the incomplete vehicle, unless changed by a subsequent manufacturer;


(ii) The vehicle as further manufactured or completed by an intermediate or final-stage manufacturer, to the extent that the vehicle is completed in accordance with the addendum to the IVD furnished by the intermediate vehicle manufacturer;


(iii) Any work done by the intermediate manufacturer on the incomplete vehicle that was not performed in accordance with the IVD or an addendum of a prior intermediate manufacturer; and


(iv) The accuracy of the information in any addendum to the IVD furnished by the intermediate vehicle manufacturer.


(2) Except as provided in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, each intermediate manufacturer of an incomplete vehicle shall affix an information label, in a manner that does not obscure the labels applied by previous stage manufacturers, to each incomplete vehicle, which contains the following statements:


(i) Name of intermediate manufacturer, preceded by the words “INTERMEDIATE MANUFACTURE BY” or “INTERMEDIATE MFR”.


(ii) Month and year in which the intermediate manufacturer performed its last manufacturing operation on the incomplete vehicle. This may be spelled out, as “JUNE 2000”, or expressed as numerals, as “6/00”. No preface is required.


(iii) “Gross Vehicle Weight Rating” or “GVWR”, followed by the appropriate value in kilograms and (pounds), if different from that identified by the incomplete vehicle manufacturer.


(iv) “Gross Axle Weight Rating” or “GAWR” followed by the appropriate value in kilograms and (pounds), if different from that identified by the incomplete vehicle manufacturer.


(v) Vehicle identification number.


(d) *Final-stage manufacturers.* (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, each final-stage manufacturer of a vehicle manufactured in two or more stages assumes legal responsibility for all certification-related duties and liabilities under the Vehicle Safety Act, except to the extent that the incomplete vehicle manufacturer or an intermediate manufacturer has provided equipment subject to a safety standard or expressly assumed responsibility for standards related to systems and components it supplied and except to the extent that the final-stage manufacturer completed the vehicle in accordance with the prior manufacturers' IVD or any addendum furnished pursuant to 49 CFR part 568, as to the Federal motor vehicle safety standards fully addressed therein.


(2) Except as provided in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, each final-stage manufacturer shall affix a certification label to each vehicle, in a manner that does not obscure the labels applied by previous stage manufacturers, and that contains the following statements:


(i) Name of final-stage manufacturer, preceded by the words “MANUFACTURED BY” or “MFD BY”.


(ii) Month and year in which final-stage manufacture is completed. This may be spelled out, as in “JUNE 2000”, or expressed in numerals, as in “6/00”. No preface is required.


(iii) “Gross Vehicle Weight Rating” or “GVWR” followed by the appropriate value in kilograms and (pounds), which shall not be less than the sum of the unloaded vehicle weight, rated cargo load, and 150 pounds times the number of the vehicle's designated seating positions. However, for school buses the minimum occupant weight allowance shall be 120 pounds per passenger and 150 pounds for the driver.


(iv) “GROSS AXLE WEIGHT RATING” or “GAWR”, followed by the appropriate value in kilograms and (pounds) for each axle, identified in order from front to rear (*e.g.*, front, first intermediate, second intermediate, rear). The ratings for any consecutive axles having identical gross axle weight ratings when equipped with tires having the same tire size designation may be stated as a single value, with the label indicating to which axles the ratings apply.


(v)(A) One of the following alternative certification statements:


(*1*) “This vehicle conforms to all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, [and Bumper and Theft Prevention Standards, if applicable] in effect in (month, year).”


(*2*) “This vehicle has been completed in accordance with the prior manufacturers' IVD, where applicable. This vehicle conforms to all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, [and Bumper and Theft Prevention Standards, if applicable] in effect in (month, year).”


(*3*) “This vehicle has been completed in accordance with the prior manufacturers' IVD, where applicable, except for [insert FMVSS(s)]. This vehicle conforms to all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, [and Bumper and Theft Prevention Standards if applicable] in effect in (month, year).”


(B) The date shown in the statement required in paragraph (d)(2)(v)(A) of this section shall not be earlier than the manufacturing date provided by the incomplete or intermediate stage manufacturer and not later than the date of completion of the final-stage manufacture.


(C) Notwithstanding the certification statements in paragraph (d)(2)(v)(A) of this section, the legal responsibilities and liabilities for certification under the Vehicle Safety Act shall be allocated among the vehicle manufacturers as provided in 567.5(b)(1), (c)(1), and (d)(1), and 49 CFR 568.4(a)(9).


(vi) Vehicle identification number.


(vii) The type classification of the vehicle as defined in 49 CFR 571.3 (*e.g.*, truck, MPV, bus, trailer).


(e) More than one set of figures for GVWR and GAWR, and one or more tire sizes, may be listed in satisfaction of the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2)(iii) and (iv) of this section, as provided in § 567.4(h).


(f) If an incomplete vehicle manufacturer assumes legal responsibility for all duties and liabilities for certification under the Vehicle Safety Act, with respect to the vehicle as finally manufactured, the incomplete vehicle manufacturer shall ensure that a label is affixed to the final vehicle in conformity with paragraph (d) of this section, except that the name of the incomplete vehicle manufacturer shall appear instead of the name of the final-stage manufacturer after the words “MANUFACTURED BY” or “MFD BY” required by paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.


(g) If an intermediate manufacturer of a vehicle assumes legal responsibility for all duties and liabilities for certification under the Vehicle Safety Act, with respect to the vehicle as finally manufactured, the intermediate manufacturer shall ensure that a label is affixed to the final vehicle in conformity with paragraph (d) of this section, except that the name of the intermediate manufacturer shall appear instead of the name of the final-stage manufacturer after the words “MANUFACTURED BY” or “MFD BY” required by paragraph (f) of this section.
