# § 567.8   Requirements for manufacturers of replica motor vehicles.

(a) Each manufacturer of a replica motor vehicle shall affix to each vehicle a label, of the type and in the manner described below, containing the statements specified in paragraph (e) of this section.


(b) The label shall be riveted or permanently affixed in such a manner that it cannot be removed without destroying or defacing it.


(c) The label shall be affixed to either the hinge pillar, door-latch post, or the door edge that meets the door-latch post, next to the driver's seating position, or if none of these locations is practicable, to the left side of the instrument panel. If that location is also not practicable, the label shall be affixed to the inward-facing surface of the door next to the driver's seating position. If none of the preceding locations is practicable, notification of that fact, together with drawings or photographs showing a suggested alternate location in the same general area, shall be submitted for approval to the Administrator, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE, Washington, DC 20590. The location of the label shall be such that it is easily readable without moving any part of the vehicle except an outer door.


(d) The lettering on the label shall be of a color that contrasts with the background of the label.


(e) The label shall contain the following information and statements, in the English language, lettered in block capitals and numerals not less than three thirty-seconds of an inch high, in the order shown:


(1) Name of manufacturer: Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, the full corporate or individual name of the actual assembler of the vehicle shall be spelled out, except that such abbreviations as “Co.” or “Inc.” and their foreign equivalents, and the first and middle initials of individuals, may be used. The name of the manufacturer shall be preceded by the words “Manufactured By” or “Mfd By.”


(2) Month and year of manufacture: This shall be the time during which work was completed at the place of main assembly of the vehicle. It may be spelled out, as “June 2000,” or expressed in numerals, as “6/00.”


(3) “Gross Vehicle Weight Rating” or “GVWR” followed by the appropriate value in pounds, which shall not be less than the sum of the unloaded vehicle weight, rated cargo load, and 150 pounds times the number of the vehicle's designated seating positions.


(4) “Gross Axle Weight Rating” or “GAWR,” followed by the appropriate value in pounds, for each axle, identified in order from front to rear (*e.g.,* front, first intermediate, second intermediate, rear). The ratings for any consecutive axles having identical gross axle weight ratings when equipped with tires having the same tire size designation may, at the option of the manufacturer, be stated as a single value, with the label indicating to which axles the ratings apply.


(i) *Examples of combined ratings: GAWR:*

(A) All axles—2,400 kg (5,290 lb.) with LT245/75R16(E) tires.


(B) Front—5,215 kg (11,500 lb.) with 295/75R22.5(G) tires.

(ii) The statement: “This replica motor vehicle is exempt from the Federal motor vehicle safety, theft prevention, and bumper standards in effect on [insert the date of manufacture of the replica motor vehicle] for [insert replica's type of motor vehicle (*e.g.,* passenger cars)] that are listed on the label found in [insert location of label listing standards from which the vehicle is exempt under 49 U.S.C. 30114(b)]”; and


(7) Vehicle identification number.


(f) If the label required under paragraph (a) includes the statement found in paragraph (e)(6)(ii) of this section, the manufacturer must affix to the replica motor vehicle a second label that meets the following criteria:


(1) The label shall be riveted or permanently affixed to the vehicle in such a manner that it cannot be removed without destroying or defacing it;


(2) The label shall be affixed to the location identified in paragraph (e)(6)(ii).
