(i) The tire being regrooved shall be a regroovable tire;


(ii) After regrooving, cord material below the grooves shall have a protective covering of tread material at least 
3/32-inch thick;


(iii) After regrooving, the new grooves generated into the tread material and any residual original molded tread groove which is at or below the new regrooved depth shall have a minimum of 90 linear inches of tread edges per linear foot of the circumference;


(iv) After regrooving, the new groove width generated into the tread material shall be a minimum of 
3/16-inch and a maximum of 
5/16-inch;


(v) After regrooving, all new grooves cut into the tread shall provide unobstructed fluid escape passages; and


(vi) After regrooving, the tire shall not contain any of the following defects, as determined by a visual examination of the tire either mounted on the rim, or dismounted, whichever is applicable:


(A) Cracking which extends to the fabric,


(B) Groove cracks or wear extending to the fabric, or

(b) *Siped regroovable tires.* No person shall sell, offer for sale, or introduce for sale or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce a regroovable tire that has been siped by cutting the tread surface without removing rubber if the tire cord material is damaged as a result of the siping process, or if the tire is siped deeper than the original or retread groove depth.
