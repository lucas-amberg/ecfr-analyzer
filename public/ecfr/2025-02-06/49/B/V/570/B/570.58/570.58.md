# § 570.58   Electric brake system.

(a) *Electric brake system integrity.* The average brake amperage value shall be not more than 20 percent above, and not less than 30 percent below, the brake manufacturer's maximum current rating. In progressing from zero to maximum, the ammeter indication shall show no fluctuation evidencing a short circuit or other interruption of current.


(1) *Inspection procedure.* Insert a low range (0 to 25 amperes for most 2- and 4-brake systems and 0 to 40 amperes for a 6-brake system) d.c. ammeter into the brake circuit between the controller and the brakes. With the controller in the “off” position, the ammeter should read zero. Gradually apply the controller to the “full on” position for a brief period (not to exceed 1 minute) and observe the maximum ammeter reading. Gradually return the controller to “full off” and observe return to zero amperes. Divide the maximum ammeter reading by the number of brakes and determine the brake amperage value.


(b) *Electric brake wiring condition.* Electric brake wiring shall not be frayed. Wiring clips or brackets shall not be broken or missing. Terminal connections shall be clean. Conductor wire gauge shall not be below the brake manufacturer's minimum recommendation.


(1) *Inspection procedure.* Examine visually for conditions specified.
