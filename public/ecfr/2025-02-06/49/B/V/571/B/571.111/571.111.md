# § 571.111   Standard No. 111; Rear visibility.

S1. *Scope.* This standard specifies requirements for rear visibility devices and systems.


S2. *Purpose.* The purpose of this standard is to reduce the number of deaths and injuries that occur when the driver of a motor vehicle does not have a clear and reasonably unobstructed view to the rear.


S3. *Application.* This standard applies to passenger cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, buses, school buses, motorcycles and low-speed vehicles.


S4. *Definitions.*

*Backing event* means an amount of time which starts when the vehicle's direction selector is placed in reverse, and ends at the manufacturer's choosing, when the vehicle forward motion reaches:


(a) a speed of 10 mph,


(b) a distance of 10 meters traveled, or


(c) a continuous duration of 10 seconds.


*Convex mirror* means a mirror having a curved reflective surface whose shape is the same as that of the exterior surface of a section of a sphere.


*Effective mirror surface* means the portions of a mirror that reflect images, excluding the mirror rim or mounting brackets.


*Environmental test fixture* means a device designed to support the external components of the rear visibility system for testing purposes, using any factory seal which would be used during normal vehicle operation, in a manner that simulates the on-vehicle component orientation during normal vehicle operation, and prevents the exposure of any test conditions to portions of the external component which are not exposed to the outside of the motor vehicle.


*External component* means any part of the rear visibility system which is exposed to the outside of the motor vehicle.


*Key* means a physical device or an electronic code which, when inserted into the starting system (by physical or electronic means), enables the vehicle operator to activate the engine or motor.


*Limited line manufacturer* means a manufacturer that sells three or fewer carlines, as that term is defined in 49 CFR 583.4, in the United States during a production year, as that term is defined in S15.


*Rearview image* means a visual image, detected by means of a single source, of the area directly behind a vehicle that is provided in a single location to the vehicle operator and by means of indirect vision.


*Rear visibility system* means the set of devices or components which together perform the function of producing the rearview image as required under this standard.


*Small manufacturer* means an original vehicle manufacturer that produces or assembles fewer than 5,000 vehicles annually for sale in the United States.

(b) Close the driver's door


(c) Activate the starting system using the key, and


(d) Select the vehicle's reverse direction at any time not less than 4.0 seconds and not more than 6.0 seconds after the driver's door is opened. The driver door is open when the edge of the driver's door opposite of the door's hinge is no longer flush with the exterior body panel.


S14.3 *Durability test procedures.* For the durability tests specified in S14.3.1, S14.3.2, and S14.3.3, the external components are mounted on an environmental test fixture.


S14.3.1 *Corrosion test procedure.* The external components are subjected to two 24-hour corrosion test cycles. In each corrosion test cycle, the external components are subjected to a salt spray (fog) test in accordance with ASTM B117-03 (incorporated by reference, see § 571.5) for a period of 24 hours. Allow 1 hour to elapse without spray between the two test cycles.


S14.3.2 *Humidity exposure test procedure.* The external components are subjected to 24 consecutive 3-hour humidity test cycles. In each humidity test cycle, external components are subjected to a temperature of 100° + 7°−0 °F (38° + 4°−0 °C) with a relative humidity of not less than 90% for a period of 2 hours. After a period not to exceed 5 minutes, the external components are subjected to a temperature of 32° + 5° −0 °F (0° + 3° −0 °C) and a humidity of not more than 30% ±10% for 1 hour. Allow no more than 5 minutes to elapse between each test cycle.


S14.3.3 *Temperature exposure test procedure.* The external components are subjected to 4 consecutive 2-hour temperature test cycles. In each temperature test cycle, the external components are first subjected to a temperature of 176° ±5 °F (80° ±3 °C) for a period of one hour. After a period not to exceed 5 minutes, the external components are subjected to a temperature of 32° + 5° −0 °F (0° + 3° −0 °C) for 1 hour. Allow no more than 5 minutes to elapse between each test cycle.


S15 *Rear visibility phase-in schedule.* For the purposes of the requirements in S15.1 through S15.7, production year means the 12-month period between May 1 of one year and April 30 of the following year, inclusive.


S15.1 *Vehicles manufactured on or after May 1, 2016 and before May 1, 2018.* At any time during or after the production years ending April 30, 2017 and April 30, 2018, each manufacturer shall, upon request from the Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance, provide information identifying the vehicles (by make, model and vehicle identification number) that have been certified as complying with S5.5.1 or S6.2.1 of this standard. The manufacturer's designation of a vehicle as a certified vehicle is irrevocable.


S15.2 *Vehicles manufactured on or after May 1, 2016 and before May 1, 2017.* Except as provided in S15.4, for passenger cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, buses, and low-speed vehicles with a GVWR of 4,536 kg or less, manufactured by a manufacturer on or after May 1, 2016, and before May 1, 2017, the number of such vehicles complying with S5.5.1 or S6.2.1 shall be not less than 10 percent of the manufacturer's—


(a) Production of such vehicles during that period; or


(b) Average annual production of such vehicles manufactured in the three previous production years.


S15.3 *Vehicles manufactured on or after May 1, 2017 and before May 1, 2018.* Except as provided in S15.4, for passenger cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, buses, and low-speed vehicles with a GVWR of 4,536 kg or less, manufactured by a manufacturer on or after May 1, 2017, and before May 1, 2018, the number of such vehicles complying with S5.5.1 or S6.2.1 shall be not less than 40 percent of the manufacturer's—


(a) Production of such vehicles during that period; or


(b) Average annual production of such vehicles manufactured in the three previous production years.


S15.4 *Exclusions from phase-in.* The following vehicles shall not be subject to the requirements in S15.1 through S15.3 but shall achieve full compliance with this standard at the end of the phase-in period in accordance with S5.5(b) and S6.2(b):


(a) Vehicles that are manufactured by small manufacturers or by limited line manufacturers.


(b) Vehicles that are altered (within the meaning of *49 CFR 567.7*) before May 1, 2017, after having been previously certified in accordance with part 567 of this chapter, and vehicles manufactured in two or more stages before May 1, 2018.


S15.5 *Vehicles produced by more than one manufacturer.* For the purpose of calculating average annual production of vehicles for each manufacturer and the number of vehicles manufactured by each manufacturer under S15.1 through S15.3, a vehicle produced by more than one manufacturer shall be attributed to a single manufacturer as follows, subject to S15.6—


(a) A vehicle that is imported shall be attributed to the importer.


(b) A vehicle manufactured in the United States by more than one manufacturer, one of which also markets the vehicle, shall be attributed to the manufacturer that markets the vehicle.
