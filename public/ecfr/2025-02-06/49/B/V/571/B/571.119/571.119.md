S5. *Tire and rim matching information.*

S5.1 Each manufacturer of tires shall ensure that a listing of the rims that may be used with each tire that he produces is provided to the public. For purposes of this section each rim listing shall include dimensional specifications and a diagram of the rim. However a listing compiled in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section need not include dimensional specifications or a diagram of a rim if the rim's dimensional specifications and diagram are contained in each listing published in accordance with paragraph (b) of this standard. The listing shall be in one of the following forms:


(a) Listed by manufacturer name or brand name in a document furnished to dealers of the manufacturer's tires, to any person upon request, and in duplicate to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590; or


(b) Contained in publications, current at the date of manufacture of the tire or any later date, of at least one of the following organizations:


S5.2 Information contained in a publication specified in S5.1(b) which lists general categories of tires and rims by size designation, type of construction, and/or intended use, shall be considered to be manufacturer's information pursuant to S5.1 for the listed tires, unless the publication itself or specific information provided according to S5.1(a) indicates otherwise.


S6. *Requirements.* Each tire shall be capable of meeting any of the applicable requirements set forth below, when mounted on a model rim assembly corresponding to any rim designated by the tire manufacturer for use with the tire in accordance with S5. However, a particular tire need not meet further requirements after having been subjected to and met the endurance test (S6.1), strength test (S6.2), or high speed performance test (S6.3).


S6.1 *Endurance.*

S6.1.1 Prior to testing in accordance with the procedures of S7.2, a tire shall exhibit no visual evidence of tread, sidewall, ply, cord, innerliner, or bead separation, chunking, broken cords, cracking, or open splices.


S6.1.2 When tested in accordance with the procedures of S7.2:


(a) There shall be no visual evidence of tread, sidewall, ply, cord, innerliner, or bead separation, chunking, broken cords, cracking, or open splices.


(b) The tire pressure at the end of the test shall be not less than the initial pressure specified in S7.2(a).


S6.2 *Strength.* When tested in accordance with the procedures of S7.3 a tire's average breaking energy value shall be not less than the value specified in Table II for that tire's size and load range.


S6.3 *High speed performance.* When tested in accordance with the procedures of S7.4, a tire shall meet the requirements set forth in S6.1.1 and S6.1.2(a) and (b). However, this requirement applies only to motorcycle tires and to non-speed-restricted tires of nominal rim diameter code 14.5 or less marked load range A, B, C, or D.


S6.4 *Treadwear indicators.* Except as specified in this paragraph, each tire shall have at least six treadwear indicators spaced approximately equally around the circumference of the tire that enable a person inspecting the tire to determine visually whether the tire has worn to a tread depth of 1.6 mm (one-sixteenth of an inch). Tires with a rim diameter code of 12 or smaller shall have at least three such treadwear indicators. Motorcycle tires shall have at least three such indicators which permit visual determination that the tire has worn to a tread depth of 0.8 mm (one-thirty-second of an inch).


S6.5 *Tire markings.* Except as specified in this paragraph, each tire shall be marked on each sidewall with the information specified in paragraphs (a) through (j) of this section. The markings shall be placed between the maximum section width (exclusive of sidewall decorations or curb ribs) and the bead on at least one sidewall, unless the maximum section width of the tire is located in an area which is not more than one-fourth of the distance from the bead to the shoulder of the tire. If the maximum section width falls within that area, the markings shall appear between the bead and a point one-half the distance from the bead to the shoulder of the tire, on at least one sidewall. The markings shall be in letters and numerals not less than 2 mm (0.078 inch) high and raised above or sunk below the tire surface not less that 0.4 mm (0.015 inch), except that the marking depth shall be not less than 0.25mm (0.010 inch) in the case of motorcycle tires. The tire identification and the DOT symbol labeling shall comply with part 574 of this chapter. Markings may appear on only one sidewall and the entire sidewall area may be used in the case of motorcycle tires and recreational, boat, baggage, and special trailer tires.


(a) The symbol DOT, which shall constitute a certification that the tire conforms to applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards. This symbol may be marked on only one sidewall.


(b) The tire identification number required by part 574 of this chapter. This number may be marked on only one sidewall.


(c) The tire size designation as listed in the documents and publications designated in S5.1.


(d) The maximum load rating and corresponding inflation pressure of the tire, shown as follows:


(e) The speed restriction of the tire, if 90 km/h (55 mph) or less, shown as follows:


(f) The actual number of plies and the composition of the ply cord material in the sidewall and, if different, in the tread area;


(g) The words “tubeless” or “tube type” as applicable.


(h) The word “regroovable” if the tire is designed for regrooving.


(i) The word “radial” if a radial tire.


(j) The letter designating the tire load range.


S6.6 *Maximum load rating.* If the maximum load rating for a particular tire size is shown in one or more of the publications described in S5.1(b), each tire of that size designation shall have a maximum load rating that is not less than the published maximum load rating, or if there are differing published ratings for the same tire size designation, not less than the lowest published maximum load rating for the size designation.


S7. *Test procedures.*

S7.1 *General conditions.*

S7.1.1 The tests are performed using an appropriate new tube, tube valve and flap assembly (as required) that allows no loss of air for testing of tube-type tires under S7.2, S7.3, and S7.4, and tubeless tires under S7.3.


S7.1.2 The tire must be capable of meeting the requirements of S7.2 and S7.4 when conditioned to a temperature of 35 °C (95 °F) for 3 hours before the test is conducted, and with an ambient temperature maintained at 35 °C (95 °F) during all phases of testing. The tire must be capable of meeting the requirements of S7.3 when conditioned at a temperature of 21 °C (70 °F) for 3 hours before the test is conducted.


S7.2 *Endurance.* (a) Mount the tire on a model rim assembly and inflate it to the inflation pressure corresponding to the maximum load rating marked on the tire. Use a single maximum load value when the tire is marked with both single and dual maximum load.


(b) After conditioning the tire-rim assembly in accordance with S7.1.2, adjust the tire pressure to that specified in (a) immediately before mounting the tire rim assembly.


(c) Mount the tire-rim assembly on an axle and press it against a flat-faced steel test wheel that is 1708 mm (67.23 inches) in diameter and at least as wide as the tread of the tire.


(d) Apply the test load and rotate the test wheel as indicated in Table III for the type of tire tested conducting each successive phase of the test without interruption.


(e) Immediately after running the tire the required time, measure the tire inflation pressure. Remove the tire from the model rim assembly, and inspect the tire.


S7.3 *Strength.* (a) Mount the tire on a model rim assembly and inflate it to the pressure corresponding to the maximum load, or maximum dual load where there is both a single and dual load marked on the tire. If the tire is tubeless, a tube may be inserted to prevent loss of air during the test in the event of puncture.


(b) After conditioning the tire-rim assembly in accordance with S7.1.2, adjust the tire pressure to that specified in (a).


(c) Force a cylindrical steel plunger, with a hemispherical end and of the diameter specified in Table I for the tire size, perpendicularly into a raised tread element as near as possible to the centerline of the tread, at a rate of 50 mm (2 inches) per minute, until the tire breaks or the plunger is stopped by the rim.


(d) Record the force and the distance of penetration just before the tire breaks, or if it fails to break, just before the plunger is stopped by the rim.


(e) Repeat the plunger application at 72° intervals around the circumference of the tire, until five measurements are made. However, in the case of tires of 12 inch rim diameter code or smaller, repeat the plunger application at 120° intervals around the circumference of the tire, until three measurements are made.


(f) Compute the breaking energy for each test point by one of the two following formulas:


(1) W = [(F × P)/2] × 10_−3_

(2) W = (F × P)/2


(g) Determine the average breaking energy value for the tire by computing the average of the values obtained in accordance with paragraph (f).


S7.4 *High speed performance.* (a) Perform steps (a) through (c) of S7.2.


(b) Apply a force of 88 percent of the maximum load rating marked on the tire (use single maximum load value when the tire is marked with both single and dual maximum loads), and rotate the test wheel at 250 rpm for 2 hours.


(c) Remove the load, allow the tire to cool to 35 °C (95 °F), and then adjust the pressure to that marked on the tire for single tire use.


(d) Reapply the same load, and without interruption or readjustment of inflation pressure, rotate the test wheel at 375 rpm for 30 minutes, then at 400 rpm for 30 minutes, and then at 425 rpm for 30 minutes.


(e) Immediately after running the tire the required time, measure the tire inflation pressure. Remove the tire from the model rim assembly, and inspect the tire.
