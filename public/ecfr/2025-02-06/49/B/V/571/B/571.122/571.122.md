*Antilock brake system* or *ABS* means a system which senses wheel slip and automatically modulates the pressure producing the braking forces at the wheel(s) to limit the degree of wheel slip.


*Baseline test* means a stop or a series of stops carried out in order to confirm the performance of the brake prior to subjecting it to a further test such as the heating procedure or wet brake stop.


*Brake* means those parts of the brake system where the forces opposing the movement of the motorcycle are developed.


*Brake system* means the combination of parts consisting of the control, the brake, and the components that provide the functional link between the control and the brake, but excluding the engine, whose function it is to progressively reduce the speed of a moving motorcycle, bring it to a halt, and keep it stationary when halted.

3) and whatever the means of propulsion a maximum design speed not exceeding 50 kilometers per hour (km/h).


*Category 3-2 motorcycle* means a three-wheeled motorcycle of any wheel arrangement with an engine cylinder capacity in the case of a thermic engine not exceeding 50 cm
3 and whatever the means of propulsion a maximum design speed not exceeding 50 km/h.
