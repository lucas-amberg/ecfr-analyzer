S6.3.1.1. For the tests at GVWR, the vehicle is loaded to its GVWR such that the weight on each axle as measured at the tire-ground interface is in proportion to its GAWR, with the fuel tank filled to 100% of capacity. However, if the weight on any axle of a vehicle at LLVW exceeds the axle's proportional share of the GVWR, the load required to reach GVWR is placed so that the weight on that axle remains the same as at LLVW.


S6.3.1.2. For the test at LLVW, the vehicle is loaded to its LLVW such that the added weight is distributed in the front passenger seat area.


S6.3.2. *Fuel tank loading.* The fuel tank is filled to 100% of capacity at the beginning of testing and may not be less than 75% of capacity during any part of the testing.


S6.3.3. *Lining preparation.* At the beginning of preparation for the road tests, the brakes of the vehicle are in the same condition as when the vehicle was manufactured. No burnishing or other special preparation is allowed, unless all vehicles sold to the public are similarly prepared as a part of the manufacturing process.


S6.3.4. *Adjustments and repairs.* These requirements must be met without replacing any brake system parts or making any adjustments to the brake system except as specified in this standard. Where brake adjustments are specified (S7.1.3), adjust the brakes, including the parking brakes, in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendation. No brake adjustments are allowed during or between subsequent tests in the test sequence.


S6.3.5. *Automatic brake adjusters.* Automatic adjusters are operational throughout the entire test sequence. They may be adjusted either manually or by other means, as recommended by the manufacturer, only prior to the beginning of the road test sequence.


S6.3.6. *Antilock brake system (ABS).* If a car is equipped with an ABS, the ABS is fully operational for all tests, except where specified in the following sections.

S6.3.10. *Vehicle openings.* All vehicle openings (doors, windows, hood, trunk, convertible top, cargo doors, etc.) are closed except as required for instrumentation purposes.


S6.3.11 *State of charge of batteries for EVs.*

S6.3.11.1 The state of charge of the propulsion batteries is determined in accordance with SAE Recommended Practice J227a (1976) (incorporated by reference, see ยง 571.5). The applicable sections of J227a (1976) are 3.2.1 through 3.2.4, 3.3.1 through 3.3.2.2, 3.4.1 and 3.4.2, 4.2.1, 5.2, 5.2.1 and 5.3.


S6.3.11.2 At the beginning of the burnish procedure (S7.1 of this standard) in the test sequence, each propulsion battery is at the maximum state of charge recommended by the manufacturer, as stated in the vehicle operator's manual or on a label that is permanently attached to the vehicle, of, if the manufacturer has made no recommendation, not less than 95 percent. During the 200-stop burnish procedure, the propulsion batteries are restored to the maximum state of charge determined as above, after each increment of 40 burnish stops until the burnish procedure is complete. The batteries may be charged at a more frequent interval during a particular 40-stop increment only if the EV is incapable of achieving the initial burnish test speed during that increment. During the burnish procedure, the propulsion batteries may be charged by external means or replaced by batteries that are at a state of charge of not less than 95 percent. For an EV having a manual control for setting the level of regenerative braking, the manual control, at the beginning of the burnish procedure, is set to provide maximum regenerative braking throughout the burnish.


S6.3.11.3 At the beginning of each performance test in the test sequence (S7.2 through S7.17 of this standard), unless otherwise specified, an EV's propulsion batteries are at the state of charge recommended by the manufacturer, as stated in the vehicle operator's manual or on a label that is permanently attached to the vehicle, or, if the manufacturer has made no recommendation, at a state of charge of not less than 95 percent. No further charging of any propulsion battery occurs during any of the performance tests in the test sequence of this standard. If the propulsion batteries are depleted during a test sequence such that the vehicle reaches automatic shut-down, will not accelerate, or the low state of charge brake warning lamp is illuminated, the vehicle is to be accelerated to brake test speed by auxiliary means. If a battery is replaced rather than recharged, the replacement battery shall be charged and measured for state of charge in accordance with these procedures.


S6.3.12 *State of charge of batteries for electrically-actuated service brakes.* A vehicle equipped with electrically-actuated service brakes also performs the following test series. Conduct 10 stopping tests from a speed of 100 kph or the maximum vehicle speed, whichever is less. At least two of the 10 stopping distances must be less than or equal to 70 meters. The vehicle is loaded to GVWR and the transmission is in the neutral position when the service brake control is actuated and throughout the remainder of the test. Each battery providing power to the electrically-actuated service brakes, shall be in a depleted state of charge for conditions (a), (b), or (c) of this paragraph as appropriate. An auxiliary means may be used to accelerate an EV to test speed.


(a) For an EV equipped with electrically-actuated service brakes deriving power from the propulsion batteries and with automatic shut-down capability of the propulsion motor(s), the propulsion batteries are at not more than five percent above the EV actual automatic shut-down critical value. The critical value is determined by measuring the state-of-charge of each propulsion battery at the instant that automatic shut-down occurs.


(b) For an EV equipped with electrically-actuated service brakes deriving power from the propulsion batteries and with no automatic shut-down capability of the propulsion motor(s), the propulsion batteries are at an average of not more than five percent above the actual state of charge at which the brake failure warning signal, required by S5.5.1(e) of this standard, is illuminated.


(c) For a vehicle which has one or more auxiliary batteries that provides electrical energy to operate the electrically-actuated service brakes, each auxiliary battery is at not more than five percent above the actual state of charge at which the brake failure warning signal, required by S5.5.1(e) of this standard, is illuminated.


S6.3.13 *Electric vehicles.*

S6.3.13.1 (a) For an EV equipped with an RBS that is part of the service brake system, the RBS is operational during the burnish and all tests, except for the test of a failed RBS.


(b) For an EV equipped with an RBS that is not part of the service brake system, the RBS is operational and set to produce the maximum regenerative braking effect during the burnish, and is disabled during the test procedures. If the vehicle is equipped with a neutral gear that automatically disables the RBS, the test procedures which are designated to be conducted in gear may be conducted in neutral.


S6.3.13.2 For tests conducted โin neutralโ, the operator of an EV with no โneutralโ position (or other means such as a clutch for disconnecting the drive train from the propulsion motor(s)) does not apply any electromotive force to the propulsion motor(s). Any electromotive force that is applied to the propulsion motor(s) automatically remains in effect unless otherwise specified by the test procedure.


S6.4. *Instrumentation.*

S6.4.1. *Brake temperature measurement.* The brake temperature is measured by plug-type thermocouples installed in the approximate center of the facing length and width of the most heavily loaded shoe or disc pad, one per brake, as shown in Figure 1. A second thermocouple may be installed at the beginning of the test sequence if the lining wear is expected to reach a point causing the first thermocouple to contact the metal rubbing surface of a drum or rotor. For center-grooved shoes or pads, thermocouples are installed within 3 mm (.12 in) to 6 mm (.24 in) of the groove and as close to the center as possible.


S6.4.2. *Brake line pressure measurement for the torque wheel test.* The vehicle shall be fitted with pressure transducers in each hydraulic circuit. On hydraulically proportioned circuits, the pressure transducer shall be downstream of the operative proportioning valve.


S6.4.3. *Brake torque measurement for the torque wheel test.* The vehicle shall be fitted with torque wheels at each wheel position, including slip ring assemblies and wheel speed indicators to permit wheel lock to be detected.


S6.5. *Procedural conditions.*

S6.5.1. *Brake control.* All service brake system performance requirements, including the partial system requirements of S7.7, S7.10 and S7.11, must be met solely by use of the service brake control.


S6.5.2. *Test speeds.* If a vehicle is incapable of attaining the specified normal test speed, it is tested at a speed that is a multiple of 5 km/h (3.1 mph) that is 4 to 8 km/h (2.5 to 5.0 mph) less than its maximum speed and its performance must be within a stopping distance given by the formula provided for the specific requirement.


S6.5.3. *Stopping distance.*

S6.5.3.1. The braking performance of a vehicle is determined by measuring the stopping distance from a given initial speed.


S6.5.3.2. Unless otherwise specified, the vehicle is stopped in the shortest distance achievable (best effort) on all stops. Where more than one stop is required for a given set of test conditions, a vehicle is deemed to comply with the corresponding stopping distance requirements if at least one of the stops is made within the prescribed distance.


S6.5.3.3. In the stopping distance formulas given for each applicable test (such as Sโค0.10V + 0.0060V
2), S is the maximum stopping distance in meters, and V is the test speed in km/h.


S6.5.4. *Vehicle position and attitude.*

S6.5.4.1. The vehicle is aligned in the center of the lane at the start of each brake application. Steering corrections are permitted during each stop.


S6.5.4.2. Stops are made without any part of the vehicle leaving the lane and without rotation of the vehicle about its vertical axis of more than ยฑ15ยฐ from the center line of the test lane at any time during any stop.


S6.5.5. *Transmission selector control.*

S6.5.5.1. For tests in neutral, a stop or snub is made in accordance with the following procedures:


(a) Exceed the test speed by 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph);


(b) Close the throttle and coast in gear to approximately 3 km/h (1.9 mph) above the test speed;


(c) Shift to neutral; and


(d) When the test speed is reached, apply the brakes.


S6.5.5.2. For tests in gear, a stop or snub is made in accordance with the following procedures:


(a) With the transmission selector in the control position recommended by the manufacturer for driving on a level surface at the applicable test speed, exceed the test speed by 6 to 12 km/h (3.7 to 7.5 mph);


(b) Close the throttle and coast in gear; and


(c) When the test speed is reached apply the brakes.


(d) To avoid engine stall, a manual transmission may be shifted to neutral (or the clutch disengaged) when the vehicle speed is below 30 km/h (18.6 mph).


S6.5.6. *Initial brake temperature (IBT).* If the lower limit of the specified IBT for the first stop in a test sequence (other than a parking brake grade holding test) has not been reached, the brakes are heated to the IBT by making one or more brake applications from a speed of 50 km/h (31.1 mph), at a deceleration rate not greater than 3 m/s
2 (9.8 fps
2).

(b) In addition to the requirement in S7.14.4(a), the stopping distance for at least one of the two hot stops must be S โค89 m (292 ft) from a test speed of 100 km/h (62.1 mph) or, for reduced test speed, S โค0.10V + 0.0079V
2. The results of the second stop may not be used to meet the requirements of S7.14.4(a).


S7.15. *Brake cooling stops.*

S7.15.1. *General information.* The cooling stops are conducted immediately after completion of the hot performance test.


S7.15.2. *Vehicle conditions.* (a) Vehicle load: GVWR only.


(b) Transmission position: In gear.


S7.15.3. *Test conditions and procedures.* (a) IBT: Temperature achieved at completion of hot performance.


(b) Test speed: 50 km/h (31.1 mph).


(c) Pedal force: Adjust as necessary to maintain specified constant deceleration rate.


(d) Deceleration rate: Maintain a constant deceleration rate of 3.0 m/s
2 (9.8 fps
2).


(e) Wheel lockup: No lockup of any wheel for longer than 0.1 seconds allowed at speeds greater than 15


(f) Number of runs: 4 stops.


(g) Immediately after the hot performance stops drive 1.5 km (0.93 mi) at 50 km/h (31.1 mph) before the first cooling stop.


(h) For the first through the third cooling stops:


(1) After each stop, immediately accelerate at the maximum rate to 50 km/h (31.1 mph).


(2) Maintain that speed until beginning the next stop at a distance of 1.5 km (0.93 mi) from the beginning of the previous stop.


(i) For the fourth cooling stop:


(1) Immediately after the fourth stop, accelerate at the maximum rate to 100 km/h (62.1 mph).


(2) Maintain that speed until beginning the recovery performance stops at a distance of 1.5 km (0.93 mi) after the beginning of the fourth cooling stop.


S7.16. *Recovery performance.*

S7.16.1. *General information.* The recovery performance test is conducted immediately after completion of the brake cooling stops.


S7.16.2. *Vehicle conditions.* (a) Vehicle load: GVWR only.


(b) Transmission position: In neutral.


S7.16.3. *Test conditions and procedures.* (a) IBT: Temperature achieved at completion of cooling stops.


(b) Test speed: 100 km/h (62.1 mph).


(c) Pedal force: The average pedal force shall not be greater than the average pedal force recorded during the shortest GVWR cold effectiveness stop.


(d) Wheel lockup: No lockup of any wheel for longer than 0.1 seconds allowed at speeds greater than 15 km/h (9.3 mph).


(e) Number of runs: 2 stops.


(f) Immediately after the fourth cooling stop, accelerate at the maximum rate to 100 km/h (62.1 mph).


(g) Maintain that speed until beginning the first recovery performance stop at a distance of 1.5 km (0.93 mi) after the beginning of the fourth cooling stop.


(h) If the vehicle is incapable of attaining 100 km/h, it is tested at the same speed used for the GVWR cold effectiveness test.


(i) Immediately after completion of the first recovery performance stop accelerate as rapidly as possible to the specified test speed and conduct the second recovery performance stop.


S7.16.4. *Performance requirements.*

The stopping distance, S, for at least one of the two stops must be within the following limits:


S7.17. *Final Inspection.* Inspect:


(a) The service brake system for detachment or fracture of any components, such as brake springs and brake shoes or disc pad facings.


(b) The friction surface of the brake, the master cylinder or brake power unit reservoir cover, and seal and filler openings, for leakage of brake fluid or lubricant.


(c) The master cylinder or brake power unit reservoir for compliance with the volume and labeling requirements of S5.4.2 and S5.4.3. In determining the fully applied worn condition, assume that the lining is worn to (1) rivet or bolt heads on riveted or bolted linings or (2) within 0.8 mm (1/32 inch) of shoe or pad mounting surface on bonded linings or (3) the limit recommended by the manufacturer, whichever is larger relative to the total possible shoe or pad movement. Drums or rotors are assumed to be at nominal design drum diameter or rotor thickness. Linings are assumed adjusted for normal operating clearance in the released position.


(d) The brake system indicators, for compliance with operation in various key positions, lens color, labeling, and location, in accordance with S5.5.
