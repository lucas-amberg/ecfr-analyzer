# § 571.205(a)   Glazing equipment manufactured before September 1, 2006 and glazing materials used in vehicles manufactured before November 1, 2006.

S1. *Scope.* This standard specifies requirements for glazing equipment manufactured before September 1, 2006 for use in motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment, and specifies requirements for motor vehicles manufactured before November 1, 2006 and for replacement glazing for those vehicles. A manufacturer may, at its option, comply with 49 CFR 571.205 instead of this standard.


S2. *Purpose.* The purpose of this standard is to reduce injuries resulting from impact to glazing surfaces, to ensure a necessary degree of transparency in motor vehicle windows for driver visibility, and to minimize the possibility of occupants being thrown through the vehicle windows in collisions.


S3. *Application.* This standard applies to glazing equipment manufactured before September 1, 2006 for use in motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment. In addition, this standard applies to the following vehicles manufactured before November 1, 2006: passenger cars, low speed vehicles, multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, buses, and motorcycles. This standard also applies to slide-in campers, and pickup covers designed to carry persons while in motion, manufactured before November 1, 2006.


S4. Definitions


*Bullet resistant shield* means a shield or barrier that is installed completely inside a motor vehicle behind and separate from glazing materials that independently comply with the requirements of this standard.


*Camper* means a structure designed to be mounted in the cargo area of a truck, or attached to an incomplete vehicle with motive power, for the purpose of providing shelter for persons.


*Glass-plastic glazing material* means a laminate of one or more layers of glass and one or more layers of plastic in which a plastic surface of the glazing faces inward when the glazing is installed in a vehicle.


*Motor home* means a multipurpose passenger vehicle that provides living accommodations for persons.


*Pickup cover* means a camper having a roof and sides but without a floor, designed to be mounted on and removable from the cargo area of a truck by the user.

(b)(1) The initial maximum haze level shall not exceed 1.0 percent. The specimens are subjected to abrasion for 100 cycles and then carefully wiped with dry lens paper (or its equivalent). The light scattered by the abraded track is measured in accordance with Test 17. The arithmetic mean of the percentages of light scattered by the three specimens shall not exceed 4.0 percent after being subjected to abrasion for 100 cycles.


(2) The specimen is remounted on the specimen holder so that it rotates substantially in a plane and subjected to abrasion for an additional 400 cycles on the same track already abraded for 100 cycles. Specimens are carefully wiped after abrasion with dry lens paper (or its equivalent). The light scattered by the abraded track is then measured as specified in Test 17. The arithmetic mean of the percentages of light scattered by the three specimens shall not exceed 10.0 percent after being subjected to abrasion for 500 cycles.
