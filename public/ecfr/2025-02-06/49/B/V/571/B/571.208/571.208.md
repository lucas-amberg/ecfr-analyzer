S10.6 *Feet.*

S10.6.1 *Driver dummy position.*

S10.6.1.1 If the vehicle has an adjustable accelerator pedal, adjust it to the full forward position. Rest the right foot of the test dummy on the undepressed accelerator pedal with the rearmost point of the heel on the floor pan in the plane of the pedal. If the foot cannot be placed on the accelerator pedal, set it initially perpendicular to the lower leg and then place it as far forward as possible in the direction of the pedal centerline with the rearmost point of the heel resting on the floor pan. If the vehicle has an adjustable accelerator pedal and the right foot is not touching the accelerator pedal when positioned as above, move the pedal rearward until it touches the right foot. If the accelerator pedal still does not touch the foot in the full rearward position, leave the pedal in that position.


S10.6.1.2 Place the left foot on the toeboard with the rearmost point of the heel resting on the floor pan as close as possible to the point of intersection of the planes described by the toeboard and the floor pan and not on the wheelwell projection. If the foot cannot be positioned on the toeboard, set it initially perpendicular to the lower leg and place it as far forward as possible with the heel resting on the floor pan. If necessary to avoid contact with the vehicle's brake or clutch pedal, rotate the test dummy's left foot about the lower leg. If there is still pedal interference, rotate the left leg outboard about the hip the minimum distance necessary to avoid the pedal interference.

(b) Each vehicle that is certified as complying with S14.6 or S14.7 shall, at each front outboard designated seating position, meet the injury criteria specified in S15.3 when tested under S16.1(a)(2).


S15.2 *Unbelted test.* Each vehicle that is certified as complying with S14 shall, at each front outboard designated seating position, meet the injury criteria specified in S15.3 of this standard when the vehicle is crash tested in accordance with the procedures specified in S16.1(b) of this standard with the anthropomorphic test devices unbelted. 


S15.3 *Injury criteria for the 49 CFR part 572, subpart O Hybrid III 5th percentile female test dummy.*

S15.3.1 All portions of the test dummy shall be contained within the outer surfaces of the vehicle passenger compartment. 


S15.3.2 *Head injury criteria.* (a) For any two points in time, t_1_ and t_2_, during the event which are separated by not more than a 15 millisecond time interval and where t_1_ is less than t_2_, the head injury criterion (HIC_15_) shall be determined using the resultant head acceleration at the center of gravity of the dummy head, a_r_, expressed as a multiple of g (the acceleration of gravity) and shall be calculated using the expression: 


(b) The maximum calculated HIC_15_ value shall not exceed 700. 


S15.3.3 The resultant acceleration calculated from the output of the thoracic instrumentation shall not exceed 60 g's, except for intervals whose cumulative duration is not more than 3 milliseconds. 


S15.3.4 Compression deflection of the sternum relative to the spine, as determined by instrumentation, shown shall not exceed 52 mm (2.0 in). 


S15.3.5 The force transmitted axially through each femur shall not exceed 6805 N (1530 lb). 


S15.3.6 *Neck injury.* When measuring neck injury, each of the following injury criteria shall be met.


(a) *Nij.*

(1) The shear force (Fx), axial force (Fz), and bending moment (My) shall be measured by the dummy upper neck load cell for the duration of the crash event as specified in S4.11. Shear force, axial force, and bending moment shall be filtered for Nij purposes at SAE Recommended Practice J211/1 MAR95 (incorporated by reference, see § 571.5) Channel Frequency Class 600.


(2) During the event, the axial force (Fz) can be either in tension or compression while the occipital condyle bending moment (Mocy) can be in either flexion or extension. This results in four possible loading conditions for Nij: Tension-extension (Nte), tension-flexion (Ntf), compression-extension (Nce), or compression-flexion (Ncf).


(3) When calculating Nij using equation S15.3.6(a)(4), the critical values, Fzc and Myc, are: 


(i) Fzc = 4287 N (964 lbf) when Fz is in tension


(ii) Fzc = 3880 N (872 lbf) when Fz is in compression


(iii) Myc = 155 Nm (114 lbf-ft) when a flexion moment exists at the occipital condyle


(iv) Myc = 67 Nm (49 lbf-ft) when an extension moment exists at the occipital condyle.


(4) At each point in time, only one of the four loading conditions occurs and the Nij value corresponding to that loading condition is computed and the three remaining loading modes shall be considered a value of zero. The expression for calculating each Nij loading condition is given by:


(5) None of the four Nij values shall exceed 1.0 at any time during the event.


(b) *Peak tension.* Tension force (Fz), measured at the upper neck load cell, shall not exceed 2620 N (589 lbf) at any time.


(c) *Peak compression.* Compression force (Fz), measured at the upper neck load cell, shall not exceed 2520 N (566 lbf) at any time.


S15.3.7 Unless otherwise indicated, instrumentation for data acquisition, data channel frequency class, and moment calculations are the same as given for the 49 CFR part 572, subpart O Hybrid III 5th percentile female test dummy.


S16. *Test procedures for rigid barrier test requirements using 5th percentile adult female dummies.*

(b) *Unbelted test.* Place a 49 CFR Part 572 Subpart O 5th percentile adult female test dummy at each front outboard seating position of a vehicle, in accordance with the procedures specified in S16.3 of this standard, except S16.3.5. Impact the vehicle traveling longitudinally forward at any speed, from 32 km/h (20 mph) to 40 km/h (25 mph), inclusive, into a fixed rigid barrier that is perpendicular within a tolerance of ±5 degrees to the line of travel of the vehicle under the applicable conditions of S16.2 of this standard.


S16.2 *Test conditions.*

S16.2.1 The vehicle, including test devices and instrumentation, is loaded as in S8.1.1.


S16.2.2 Movable vehicle windows and vents are placed in the fully closed position, unless the vehicle manufacturer chooses to specify a different adjustment position prior to the time the vehicle is certified.


S16.2.3 Convertibles and open-body type vehicles have the top, if any, in place in the closed passenger compartment configuration.


S16.2.4 Doors are fully closed and latched but not locked.


S16.2.5 The dummy is clothed in form fitting cotton stretch garments with short sleeves and above the knee length pants. A size 7
1/2 W shoe which meets the configuration and size specifications of MIL-S-21711E (incorporated by reference, see § 571.5) or its equivalent is placed on each foot of the test dummy.


S16.2.6 Limb joints are set at one g, barely restraining the weight of the limb when extended horizontally. Leg joints are adjusted with the torso in the supine position.


S16.2.7 Instrumentation shall not affect the motion of dummies during impact.


S16.2.8 The stabilized temperature of the dummy is at any level between 20.6 °C and 22.2 °C (69 °F to 72 °F).

S16.2.9.1 Adjust a tiltable steering control, if possible, so that the steering control hub is at the geometric center of its full range of driving positions.


S16.2.9.2 If there is no setting detent at the mid-position, lower the steering control to the detent just below the mid-position.


S16.2.9.3 If the steering column is telescoping, place the steering column in the mid-position. If there is no mid-position, move the steering control rearward one position from the mid-position.


S16.2.10 *Front seat set-up.*

S16.2.10.1 *Lumbar support adjustment.* Position adjustable lumbar supports so that the lumbar support is in its lowest, retracted or deflated adjustment position.


S16.2.10.2 *Other seat adjustments.* Position any adjustable parts of the seat that provide additional support so that they are in the lowest or most open adjustment position. Position any adjustable head restraint in the lowest and most forward position.


S16.2.10.3 *Seat position adjustment.* If the front right outboard passenger seat does not adjust independently of the front left outboard seat, the front left outboard seat shall control the final position of the front right outboard passenger seat. If an inboard passenger seat does not adjust independently of an outboard seat, the outboard seat shall control the final position of the inboard passenger seat.


S16.2.10.3.1 Using only the controls that primarily move the seat and seat cushion independent of the seat back in the fore and aft directions, move the seat cushion reference point (SCRP) to the rearmost position. Using any part of any control, other than those just used, determine the full range of angles of the seat cushion reference line and set the seat cushion reference line to the middle of the range. Using any part of any control other than those that primarily move the seat or seat cushion fore and aft, while maintaining the seat cushion reference line angle, place the SCRP to its lowest position.


S16.2.10.3.2 Using only the control that primarily moves the seat fore and aft, move the SCRP to the full forward position.


S16.2.10.3.3 If the seat or seat cushion height is adjustable, other than by the controls that primarily move the seat or seat cushion fore and aft, determine the maximum and minimum heights of the SCRP, while maintaining, as closely as possible, the angle determined in S16.2.10.3.1. Set the SCRP at the midpoint height with the seat cushion reference line angle set as closely as possible to the angle determined in S16.2.10.3.1. Mark location of the seat for future reference.


S16.3 *Dummy seating positioning procedures.* The 49 CFR Part 572 Subpart O 5th percentile adult female test dummy is positioned as follows:


S16.3.1 *General provisions and definitions.*

S16.3.1.1 All angles are measured with respect to the horizontal plane unless otherwise stated.


S16.3.1.2 The dummy's neck bracket is adjusted to align the zero degree index marks.


S16.3.1.3 The term “midsagittal plane” refers to the vertical plane that separates the dummy into equal left and right halves.


S16.3.1.4 The term “vertical longitudinal plane” refers to a vertical plane parallel to the vehicle's longitudinal centerline.


S16.3.1.5 The term “vertical plane” refers to a vertical plane, not necessarily parallel to the vehicle's longitudinal centerline.


S16.3.1.6 The term “transverse instrumentation platform” refers to the transverse instrumentation surface inside the dummy's skull casting to which the neck load cell mounts. This surface is perpendicular to the skull cap's machined inferior-superior mounting surface.


S16.3.1.7 The term “thigh” refers to the femur between, but not including, the knee and the pelvis.


S16.3.1.8 The term “leg” refers to the lower part of the entire leg, including the knee.


S16.3.1.9 The term “foot” refers to the foot, including the ankle.


S16.3.1.10 The longitudinal centerline of a bucket seat cushion is defined by a vertical plane that passes through the SgRP and is parallel to the longitudinal centerline of the vehicle.


S16.3.1.11 For leg and thigh angles, use the following references:


S16.3.1.11.1 *Thigh*—a straight line on the thigh skin between the center of the 1/2-13 UNC-2B tapped hole in the upper leg femur clamp (see drawings 880105-504 (left thigh) and 880105-505 (right thigh), upper leg femur clamp) and the knee pivot shoulder bolt (part 880105-527 in drawing 880105-528R & 528L, sliding knee assembly without potentiometer).


S16.3.1.11.2 *Leg*—a straight line on the leg skin between the center of the ankle shell (parts 880105-609 & 633 in drawing 880105-660, ankle assembly) and the knee pivot shoulder bolt (part 880105-527 in drawing 880105-528R & 528L, sliding knee assembly without potentiometer).


S16.3.1.12 The term “seat cushion reference point” (SCRP) means a point placed on the outboard side of the seat cushion at a horizontal distance between 150 mm (5.9 in) and 250 mm (9.8 in) from the front edge of the seat used as a guide in positioning the seat.


S16.3.1.13 The term “seat cushion reference line” means a line on the side of the seat cushion, passing through the seat cushion reference point, whose projection in the vehicle vertical longitudinal plane is straight and has a known angle with respect to the horizontal.


S16.3.2 *Driver dummy positioning.*

S16.3.2.1 *Driver torso/head/seat back angle positioning.*

S16.3.2.1.1 With the seat in the position determined in S16.2.10.3.3, use only the control that primarily moves the seat fore and aft to place the seat in the rearmost position. If the seat cushion reference line angle automatically changes as the seat is moved from the full forward position, maintain, as closely as possible, the seat cushion reference line angle determined in S16.2.10.3.1, for the final forward position when measuring the pelvic angle as specified in S16.3.2.1.11. The seat cushion reference angle position may be achieved through the use of any seat or seat cushion adjustments other than that which primarily moves the seat or seat cushion fore-aft.


S16.3.2.1.2 Fully recline the seat back, if adjustable. Install the dummy into the driver's seat, such that when the legs are positioned 120 degrees to the thighs, the calves of the legs are not touching the seat cushion.


S16.3.2.1.3 *Bucket seats.* Place the dummy on the seat cushion so that its midsagittal plane is vertical and coincides with the vertical longitudinal plane through the center of the seat cushion, within ±10 mm (±0.4 in).


S16.3.2.1.4 *Bench seats.* Position the midsagittal plane of the dummy vertical and parallel to the vehicle's longitudinal centerline and aligned within ±10 mm (±0.4 in) of the center of the steering control.


S16.3.2.1.5 Hold the dummy's thighs down and push rearward on the upper torso to maximize the dummy's pelvic angle.


S16.3.2.1.6 Place the legs at 120 degrees to the thighs. Set the initial transverse distance between the longitudinal centerlines at the front of the dummy's knees at 160 to 170 mm (6.3 to 6.7 in), with the thighs and legs of the dummy in vertical planes. Push rearward on the dummy's knees to force the pelvis into the seat so there is no gap between the pelvis and the seat back or until contact occurs between the back of the dummy's calves and the front of the seat cushion.


S16.3.2.1.7 Gently rock the upper torso laterally in a side to side motion three times through a ±5 degree arc (approximately 51 mm (2 in) side to side).


S16.3.2.1.8 If needed, extend the legs slightly so that the feet are not in contact with the floor pan. Let the thighs rest on the seat cushion to the extent permitted by the foot movement. Keeping the leg and the thigh in a vertical plane, place the foot in the vertical longitudinal plane that passes through the centerline of the accelerator pedal. Rotate the left thigh outboard about the hip until the center of the knee is the same distance from the midsagittal plane of the dummy as the right knee ±5 mm (±0.2 in). Using only the control that primarily moves the seat fore and aft, attempt to return the seat to the full forward position. If either of the dummy's legs first contacts the steering control, then adjust the steering control, if adjustable, upward until contact with the steering control is avoided. If the steering control is not adjustable, separate the knees enough to avoid steering control contact. Proceed with moving the seat forward until either the leg contacts the vehicle interior or the seat reaches the full forward position. (The right foot may contact and depress the accelerator and/or change the angle of the foot with respect to the leg during seat movement.) If necessary to avoid contact with the vehicles brake or clutch pedal, rotate the test dummy's left foot about the leg. If there is still interference, rotate the left thigh outboard about the hip the minimum distance necessary to avoid pedal interference. If a dummy leg contacts the vehicle interior before the full forward position is attained, position the seat at the next detent where there is no contact. If the seat is a power seat, move the seat fore and aft to avoid contact while assuring that there is a maximum of 5 mm (0.2 in) distance between the vehicle interior and the point on the dummy that would first contact the vehicle interior. If the steering control was moved, return it to the position described in S16.2.9. If the steering control contacts the dummy's leg(s) prior to attaining this position, adjust it to the next higher detent, or if infinitely adjustable, until there is 5 mm (0.2 in) clearance between the control and the dummy's leg(s).


S16.3.2.1.9 For vehicles without adjustable seat backs, adjust the lower neck bracket to level the head as much as possible. For vehicles with adjustable seat backs, while holding the thighs in place, rotate the seat back forward until the transverse instrumentation platform of the head is level to within ±0.5 degree, making sure that the pelvis does not interfere with the seat bight. Inspect the abdomen to ensure that it is properly installed. If the torso contacts the steering control, adjust the steering control in the following order until there is no contact: Telescoping adjustment, lowering adjustment, raising adjustment. If the vehicle has no adjustments, or contact with the steering control cannot be eliminated by adjustment, position the seat at the next detent where there is no contact with the steering control as adjusted in S16.2.9. If the seat is a power seat, position the seat to avoid contact while assuring that there is a maximum of 5 mm (0.2 in) distance between the steering control as adjusted in S16.2.9 and the point of contact on the dummy.


S16.3.2.1.10 If it is not possible to achieve the head level within ±0.5 degrees, minimize the angle.


S16.3.2.1.11 Measure and set the dummy's pelvic angle using the pelvic angle gauge (drawing TE-2504, incorporated by reference in 49 CFR part 572, subpart O of this chapter). The angle shall be set to 20.0 degrees ±2.5 degrees. If this is not possible, adjust the pelvic angle as close to 20.0 degrees as possible while keeping the transverse instrumentation platform of the head as level as possible by adjustments specified in S16.3.2.1.9 and S16.3.2.1.10.


S16.3.2.1.12 If the dummy is contacting the vehicle interior after these adjustments, using only the control that primarily moves the seat fore and aft, move the seat rearward until there is a maximum of 5 mm (0.2 in) between the contact point of the dummy and the interior of the vehicle or if it has a manual seat adjustment, to the next rearward detent position. If after these adjustments, the dummy contact point is more than 5 mm (0.2 in) from the vehicle interior and the seat is still not in its forwardmost position, move the seat forward until the contact point is a maximum of 5 mm (0.2 in) from the vehicle interior, or if it has a manual seat adjustment, move the seat to the closest detent position that causes no contact, or until the seat reaches its forwardmost position, whichever occurs first.


S16.3.2.2 *Driver foot positioning.*

S16.3.2.2.1 If the vehicle has an adjustable accelerator pedal, adjust it to the full forward position. If the heel of the right foot can contact the floor pan, follow the positioning procedure in (a). If not, follow the positioning procedure in (b).


(a) Rest the right foot of the test dummy on the undepressed accelerator pedal with the rearmost point of the heel on the floor pan in the plane of the pedal. If the foot cannot be placed on the accelerator pedal, set it initially perpendicular to the leg and then place it as far forward as possible in the direction of the pedal centerline with the rearmost point of the heel resting on the floor pan. If the vehicle has an adjustable accelerator pedal and the right foot is not touching the accelerator pedal when positioned as above, move the pedal rearward until it touches the right foot. If the accelerator pedal in the full rearward position still does not touch the foot, leave the pedal in that position. Extend the foot and lower leg by decreasing the knee flexion angle until any part of the foot contacts the undepressed accelerator pedal. If the foot does not contact the pedal, place the highest part of the foot at the same height as the highest part of the pedal.


(b) Extend the foot and lower leg by decreasing the knee flexion angle until any part of the foot contacts the undepressed accelerator pedal or the highest part of the foot is at the same height as the highest part of the pedal. If the vehicle has an adjustable accelerator pedal and the right foot is not touching the accelerator pedal when positioned as above, move the pedal rearward until it touches the right foot.


S16.3.2.2.2 If the ball of the right foot does not contact the pedal, increase the ankle plantar flexion angle such that the toe of the foot contacts or is as close as possible to contact with the undepressed accelerator pedal.


S16.3.2.2.3 If, in its final position, the heel is off of the vehicle floor, a spacer block must be used under the heel to support the final foot position (see figure 13). The surface of the block in contact with the heel must have an inclination of 30 degrees, measured from the horizontal, with the highest surface towards the rear of the vehicle.


S16.3.2.2.4 Place the left foot on the toe-board with the rearmost point of the heel resting on the floor pan as close as possible to the point of intersection of the planes described by the toe-board and floor pan.


S16.3.2.2.5 If the left foot cannot be positioned on the toe board, place the foot perpendicular to the lower leg centerline as far forward as possible with the heel resting on the floor pan.


S16.3.2.2.6 If the left foot does not contact the floor pan, place the foot parallel to the floor and place the lower leg as perpendicular to the thigh as possible.


S16.3.2.2.7 When positioning the test dummy under S16.3.2.2.4, S16.3.2.2.5, and S16.2.2.6, avoid contact between the left foot of the test dummy and the vehicle's brake pedal, clutch pedal, wheel well projection, and foot rest. To avoid this contact, use the three foot position adjustments listed in paragraphs (a) through (c). The adjustment options are listed in priority order, with each subsequent option incorporating the previous. In making each adjustment, move the foot the minimum distance necessary to avoid contact. If it is not possible to avoid all prohibited foot contact, give priority to avoiding brake or clutch pedal contact.


(a) Rotate (abduction/adduction) the test dummy's left foot about the lower leg,


(b) Plantar flex the foot,


(c) Rotate the left leg about the hip in either an outboard or inboard direction.


S16.3.2.3 *Driver arm/hand positioning.*

S16.3.2.3.1 Place the dummy's upper arms adjacent to the torso with the arm centerlines as close to a vertical longitudinal plane as possible.


S16.3.2.3.2 Place the palms of the dummy in contact with the outer part of the steering control rim at its horizontal centerline with the thumbs over the steering control rim.


S16.3.2.3.3 If it is not possible to position the thumbs inside the steering control rim at its horizontal centerline, then position them above and as close to the horizontal centerline of the steering control rim as possible.


S16.3.2.3.4 Lightly tape the hands to the steering control rim so that if the hand of the test dummy is pushed upward by a force of not less than 9 N (2 lb) and not more than 22 N (5 lb), the tape releases the hand from the steering control rim.


S16.3.3 Front outboard *passenger dummy positioning.*

S16.3.3.1 Front outboard *passenger torso/head/seat back angle positioning.*

S16.3.3.1.1 With the seat at the mid-height in the full forward position determined in S16.2.10.3.3, use only the control that primarily moves the seat fore and aft to place the seat in the rearmost position, without adjusting independent height controls. If the seat cushion reference line angle automatically changes as the seat is moved from the full forward position, maintain as closely as possible the seat cushion reference line angle in S16.2.10.3.1, for the final forward position when measuring the pelvic angle as specified in S16.3.3.1.11. The seat cushion reference line angle position may be achieved through the use of any seat or seat cushion adjustments other than that which primarily moves the seat or seat cushion fore-aft.


S16.3.3.1.2 Fully recline the seat back, if adjustable. Install the dummy into any front outboard passenger seat, such that when the legs are 120 degrees to the thighs, the calves of the legs are not touching the seat cushion.


S16.3.3.1.3 *Bucket seats.* Place the dummy on the seat cushion so that its midsagittal plane is vertical and coincides with the vertical longitudinal plane through the center of the seat cushion, within ±10 mm (±0.4 mm).


S16.3.3.1.4 *Bench seats.* Position the midsagittal plane of the dummy vertical and parallel to the vehicle's longitudinal centerline and the same distance from the vehicle's longitudinal centerline, within ±10 mm (±0.4 in), as the midsagittal plane of the driver dummy, if there is a driver's seating position. Otherwise, the midsagittal plane of any front outboard passenger dummy shall be vertical, parallel to the vehicle's longitudinal centerline, and pass, within ±10 mm (±0.4 in), through the seating reference point of the seat that it occupies.


S16.3.3.1.5 Hold the dummy's thighs down and push rearward on the upper torso to maximize the dummy's pelvic angle.


S16.3.3.1.6 Place the legs at 120 degrees to the thighs. Set the initial transverse distance between the longitudinal centerlines at the front of the dummy's knees at 160 to 170 mm (6.3 to 6.7 in), with the thighs and legs of the dummy in vertical planes. Push rearward on the dummy's knees to force the pelvis into the seat so there is no gap between the pelvis and the seat back or until contact occurs between the back of the dummy's calves and the front of the seat cushion.


S16.3.3.1.7 Gently rock the upper torso laterally side to side three times through a ±5 degree arc (approximately 51 mm (2 in) side to side).


S16.3.3.1.8 If needed, extend the legs slightly so that the feet are not in contact with the floor pan. Let the thighs rest on the seat cushion to the extent permitted by the foot movement. With the feet perpendicular to the legs, place the heels on the floor pan. If a heel will not contact the floor pan, place it as close to the floor pan as possible. Using only the control that primarily moves the seat fore and aft, attempt to return the seat to the full forward position. If a dummy leg contacts the vehicle interior before the full forward position is attained, position the seat at the next detent where there is no contact. If the seats are power seats, position the seat to avoid contact while assuring that there is a maximum of 5 mm (0.2 in) distance between the vehicle interior and the point on the dummy that would first contact the vehicle interior.


S16.3.3.1.9 For vehicles without adjustable seat backs, adjust the lower neck bracket to level the head as much as possible. For vehicles with adjustable seat backs, while holding the thighs in place, rotate the seat back forward until the transverse instrumentation platform of the head is level to within ±0.5 degrees, making sure that the pelvis does not interfere with the seat bight. Inspect the abdomen to insure that it is properly installed.


S16.3.3.1.10 If it is not possible to orient the head level within ±0.5 degrees, minimize the angle.


S16.3.3.1.11 Measure and set the dummy's pelvic angle using the pelvic angle gauge (drawing TE-2504, incorporated by reference in 49 CFR Part 572, Subpart O, of this chapter). The angle shall be set to 20.0 degrees ±2.5 degrees. If this is not possible, adjust the pelvic angle as close to 20.0 degrees as possible while keeping the transverse instrumentation platform of the head as level as possible, as specified in S16.3.3.1.9 and S16.3.3.1.10.


S16.3.3.1.12 If the dummy is contacting the vehicle interior after these adjustments, using only the control that primarily moves the seat fore and aft, move the seat rearward until there is a maximum of 5 mm (0.2 in) between the contact point of the dummy and the interior of the vehicle or if it has a manual seat adjustment, to the next rearward detent position. If after these adjustments, the dummy contact point is more than 5 mm (0.2 in) from the vehicle interior and the seat is still not in its forwardmost position, move the seat forward until the contact point is a maximum of 5 mm (0.2 in) from the vehicle interior, or if it has a manual seat adjustment, move the seat to the closest detent position that causes no contact, or until the seat reaches its forwardmost position, whichever occurs first.


S16.3.3.2 Front outboard *passenger foot positioning.*

S16.3.3.2.1 Place the passenger's feet flat on the toe board.


S16.3.3.2.2 If the feet cannot be placed flat on the toe board, set them perpendicular to the leg centerlines and place them as far forward as possible with the heels resting on the floor pan. If either foot does not contact the floor pan, place the foot parallel to the floor pan and place the lower leg as perpendicular to the thigh as possible.


S16.3.3.3 Front outboard *passenger arm/hand positioning.*

S16.3.3.3.1 Place the dummy's upper arms in contact with the seat back and the torso.


S16.3.3.3.2 Place the palms of the dummy in contact with the outside of the thighs.


S16.3.3.3.3 Place the little fingers in contact with the seat cushion.


S16.3.4 *Driver and front outboard passenger adjustable head restraints.*

S16.3.4.1 If the head restraint has an automatic adjustment, leave it where the system positions the restraint after the dummy is placed in the seat.


S16.3.4.2 Adjust each head restraint to its lowest position.


S16.3.4.3 Measure the vertical distance from the top most point of the head restraint to the bottom most point. Locate a horizontal plane through the midpoint of this distance. Adjust each head restraint vertically so that this horizontal plane is aligned with the center of gravity (CG) of the dummy head.


S16.3.4.3 If the above position is not attainable, move the vertical center of the head restraint to the closest detent below the center of the head CG.


S16.3.4.4 If the head restraint has a fore and aft adjustment, place the restraint in the forwardmost position or until contact with the head is made, whichever occurs first.


S16.3.5 *Driver and front outboard passenger manual belt adjustment (for tests conducted with a belted dummy)*

S16.3.5.1 If an adjustable seat belt D-ring anchorage exists, place it in the manufacturer's design position for a 5th percentile adult female with the seat in the position specified in S16.2.10.3.


S16.3.5.2 Place the Type 2 manual belt around the test dummy and fasten the latch.


S16.3.5.3 Ensure that the dummy's head remains as level as possible, as specified in S16.3.2.1.9 and S16.3.2.1.10 and S16.3.3.1.9 and S16.3.3.1.10.


S16.3.5.4 Remove all slack from the lap belt. Pull the upper torso webbing out of the retractor and allow it to retract; repeat this operation four times. Apply a 9 N (2 lbf) to 18 N (4 lbf) tension load to the lap belt. If the belt system is equipped with a tension-relieving device, introduce the maximum amount of slack into the upper torso belt that is recommended by the manufacturer. If the belt system is not equipped with a tension-relieving device, allow the excess webbing in the shoulder belt to be retracted by the retractive force of the retractor.


S17 *Offset frontal deformable barrier requirements using 5th percentile adult female test dummies.* Each vehicle that is certified as complying with S14 shall, at each front outboard designated seating position, meet the injury criteria specified in S15.3 of this standard when the vehicle is crash tested in accordance with the procedures specified in S18 of this standard with the anthropomorphic test devices restrained by a Type 2 seat belt assembly.

(ii) Fzc = 1460 N (328 lbf) when Fz is in compression


(iii) Myc = 43 Nm (32 lbf-ft) when a flexion moment exists at the occipital condyle


(iv) Myc = 17 Nm (13 lbf-ft) when an extension moment exists at the occipital condyle. 


(4) At each point in time, only one of the four loading conditions occurs and the Nij value corresponding to that loading condition is computed and the three remaining loading modes shall be considered a value of zero. The expression for calculating each Nij loading condition is given by: 


(5) None of the four Nij values shall exceed 1.0 at any time during the event.


(b) *Peak tension.* Tension force (Fz), measured at the upper neck load cell, shall not exceed 780 N (175 lbf) at any time.


(c) *Peak compression.* Compression force (Fz), measured at the upper neck load cell, shall not exceed 960 N (216 lbf) at any time.


S19.4.5 Unless otherwise indicated, instrumentation for data acquisition, data channel frequency class, and moment calculations are the same as given for the 49 CFR part 572 Subpart R 12-month-old CRABI test dummy.

Shear force, axial force, and bending moment shall be filtered for Nij purposes at SAE Recommended Practice J211/1 MAR95 (incorporated by reference, see § 571.5) Channel Frequency Class 600.


(2) During the event, the axial force (Fz) can be either in tension or compression while the occipital condyle bending moment (Mocy) can be in either flexion or extension. This results in four possible loading conditions for Nij: Tension-extension (Nte), tension-flexion (Ntf), compression-extension (Nce), or compression-flexion (Ncf).


(3) When calculating Nij using equation S21.5.5(a)(4), the critical values, Fzc and Myc, are:


(i) Fzc = 2120 N (477 lbf) when Fz is in tension


(ii) Fzc = 2120 N (477 lbf) when Fz is in compression


(iii) Myc = 68 Nm (50 lbf-ft) when a flexion moment exists at the occipital condyle


(iv) Myc = 27 Nm (20 lbf-ft) when an extension moment exists at the occipital condyle.


(4) At each point in time, only one of the four loading conditions occurs and the Nij value corresponding to that loading condition is computed and the three remaining loading modes shall be considered a value of zero. The expression for calculating each Nij loading condition is given by:


(5) None of the four Nij values shall exceed 1.0 at any time during the event.


(b) *Peak tension.* Tension force (Fz), measured at the upper neck load cell, shall not exceed 1130 N (254 lbf) at any time.


(c) *Peak compression.* Compression force (Fz), measured at the upper neck load cell, shall not exceed 1380 N (310 lbf) at any time.

(b) Position the dummy in a kneeling position in any front outboard passenger vehicle seat with the dummy facing the rear of the vehicle. Position the dummy such that the dummy's head and torso are in contact with the seat back. Push down on the legs so that they contact the seat as much as possible and then release. Place the arms parallel to the spine.


(c) Start the vehicle engine or place the ignition in the “on” position, whichever will turn on the suppression system, and then close all vehicle doors.


(d) Wait 10 seconds, then check whether the air bag is deactivated.


S22.2.2.8 *Lying on seat.* This test is performed only in vehicles with 3 designated front seating positions.


(a) Lay the dummy on any front outboard passenger vehicle seat such that the following criteria are met:


(1) The midsagittal plane of the dummy is horizontal,


(2) The dummy's spine is perpendicular to the vehicle's longitudinal axis,

(b) Rotate the thighs as much as possible toward the chest of the dummy and rotate the legs as much as possible against the thighs.


(c) Move the dummy's upper left arm parallel to the vehicle's transverse plane and the lower left arm 90 degrees to the upper arm. Rotate the lower left arm about the elbow joint and toward the dummy's head until movement is obstructed.


(d) Start the vehicle engine or place the ignition in the “on” position, whichever will turn on the suppression system, and then close all vehicle doors.


(e) Wait 10 seconds, then check whether the air bag is deactivated.


S22.3 *Static tests of automatic suppression feature which shall result in activation of any front outboard passenger air bag system.*

S22.3.1 Each vehicle certified to this option shall comply in tests conducted with any front outboard passenger seating position at the mid-height, in the full rearward, and middle positions determined in S22.1.7.4, and the forward position determined in S16.3.3.1.8.


S22.3.2 Place a 49 CFR part 572 subpart O 5th percentile adult female test dummy at any front outboard passenger seating position of the vehicle, in accordance with procedures specified in S16.3.3 of this standard, except as specified in S22.3.1. Do not fasten the seat belt.


S22.3.3 Start the vehicle engine or place the ignition in the “on” position, whichever will turn on the suppression system, and then close all vehicle doors.


S22.3.4 Wait 10 seconds, then check whether the air bag system is activated.


S22.4 *Low risk deployment tests.*

S22.4.1 Each vehicle that is certified as complying with S21.4 shall meet the following test requirements with the 49 CFR part 572, subpart P 3-year-old child dummy in both of the following positions: Position 1 (S22.4.2) and Position 2 (S22.4.3).


S22.4.1.1 Locate and mark a point on the front of the dummy's chest jacket on the midsagittal plane that is 114 mm (4.5 in) ±3 mm (±0.1 in) along the surface of the skin from the top of the skin at the neck line. This is referred to as “Point 1.”


S22.4.1.2 Mark a point on the instrument panel that is longitudinally and transversely, as measured along the surface of the instrument panel, within ±6 mm (±0.2 in) of the point that is defined by the intersection of the instrument panel and a line between the volumetric center of the smallest volume that can encompass the folded undeployed air bag and the volumetric center of the static fully inflated air bag.


S22.4.1.3 Locate the vertical plane parallel to the vehicle longitudinal centerline through the point located in S22.4.1.2. This is referred to as “Plane D.”


S22.4.1.4 Locate the horizontal plane through the point located in S22.4.1.2. This is referred to as “Plane C.”


S22.4.2 *Position 1 (chest on instrument panel).*

S22.4.2.1 Set the seat and seat cushion in the positions determined in S16.2.10.3.1. If the seat back is adjustable independent of the seat, place the seat back at the manufacturer's nominal design seat back angle for a 50th percentile adult male as specified in S8.1.3. Position any adjustable parts of the seat that provide additional support so that they are in the lowest or most open adjustment position. If adjustable, set the head restraint in the lowest and most forward position.


S22.4.2.2 Place the dummy in any front outboard passenger seat such that:


S22.4.2.2.1 The midsagittal plane is coincident with Plane D within ±10 mm (±0.4 in).


S22.4.2.2.2 The legs are initially vertical to the floor pan. The legs and thighs shall be adjusted to the extent necessary for the head/torso to contact the instrument panel as specified in S22.4.2.3.


S22.4.2.2.3 The upper arms are parallel to the torso and the hands are in contact with the thighs.


S22.4.2.3 Without changing the seat position and with the dummy's thorax instrument cavity rear face vertical, move the dummy forward until the dummy head/torso contacts the instrument panel. If the dummy loses contact with the seat cushion because of the forward movement, maintain the height of the dummy and the angle of the thigh with respect to the torso. Once contact is made, raise the dummy vertically until Point 1 lies in Plane C within ±10 mm (±0.4 in). If the dummy's head contacts the windshield and keeps Point 1 from reaching Plane C, lower the dummy until there is no more than 5 mm (0.2 in) clearance between the head and the windshield. (The dummy shall remain in contact with the instrument panel while being raised or lowered, which may change the dummy's fore-aft position.)


S22.4.2.4 If possible, position the legs of the dummy so that the legs are vertical and the feet rest flat on the floor pan of the vehicle. If the positioning against the instrument panel does not allow the feet to be on the floor pan, the feet shall be parallel to the floor pan.


S22.4.2.5 If necessary, material with a maximum breaking strength of 311 N (70 lb) and spacer blocks may be used to support the dummy in position. The material should support the torso rather than the head. Support the dummy so that there is minimum interference with the full rotational and translational freedom for the upper torso of the dummy and the material does not interfere with the air bag.


S22.4.3 *Position 2 (head on instrument panel).*

S22.4.3.1 Place any front outboard passenger seat at the mid-height, in full rearward seating position determined in S22.1.7.4. Place the seat back, if adjustable independent of the seat, at the manufacturer's nominal design seat back angle for a 50th percentile adult male as specified in S8.1.3. Position any adjustable parts of the seat that provide additional support so that they are in the lowest or most open adjustment position. If adjustable, set the head restraint in the lowest and most forward position.


S22.4.3.2 Place the dummy in any front outboard passenger seat such that:


S22.4.3.2.1 The midsagittal plane is coincident with Plane D within ±10 mm (±0.4 in).


S22.4.3.2.2 The legs are vertical to the floor pan, the back of the legs are in contact with the seat cushion, and the dummy's thorax instrument cavity rear face is vertical. If it is not possible to position the dummy with the legs in the prescribed position, rotate the legs forward until the dummy is resting on the seat with the feet positioned flat on the floor pan, and the back of the legs are in contact with the front of the seat cushion. Set the transverse distance between the longitudinal centerlines at the front of the dummy's knees at 86 to 91 mm (3.4 to 3.6 in), with the thighs and the legs of the dummy in vertical planes.


S22.4.3.2.3 The upper arms are parallel to the torso and the hands are in contact with the thighs.


S22.4.3.3 Using only the control that primarily moves the seat in the fore and aft direction, move the seat forward, while maintaining the thorax instrument cavity rear face orientation until any part of the dummy contacts the vehicle's instrument panel.


S22.4.3.4 If dummy contact has not been made with the vehicle's instrument panel at the full forward seating position of the seat, slide the dummy forward until contact is made. Maintain the thorax instrument cavity rear face vertical orientation. If the dummy loses contact with the seat, from that point forward, maintain the height of the dummy. Except as provided in S22.4.3.5, maintain the angle of the thigh with respect to the horizontal.


S22.4.3.5 If head/torso contact with the instrument panel has not been made, maintain the angle of the thighs with respect to the horizontal while applying a force towards the front of the vehicle on the spine of the dummy between the shoulder joints, perpendicular to the thorax instrument cavity rear face, until the head or torso comes into contact with the vehicle's instrument panel or until a maximum force of 222 N (50 lb) is achieved. If the head/torso is still not in contact with the instrument panel, hold the femurs and release the 222 N (50 lb) force. While maintaining the relative angle between the torso and the femurs, roll the dummy forward on the seat cushion, without sliding, until head/torso contact with the instrument panel is achieved. If seat contact is lost prior to or during femur rotation out of the horizontal plane, constrain the dummy to rotate about the dummy H-point. If the dummy cannot be rolled forward on the seat due to contact of the dummy feet with the floor pan, extend the lower legs forward, at the knees, until floor pan contact is avoided.


S22.4.3.6 If necessary, material with a maximum breaking strength of 311 N (70 lb) and spacer blocks may be used to support the dummy in position. The material should support the torso rather than the head. Support the dummy so that there is minimum interference with the full rotational and translational freedom for the upper torso of the dummy and the material does not interfere with the air bag.


S22.4.4 Deploy any front outboard passenger frontal air bag system. If the frontal air bag system contains a multistage inflator, the vehicle shall be able to comply with the injury criteria at any stage or combination of stages or time delay between successive stages that could occur in a rigid barrier crash test at or below 26 km/h (16 mph), under the test procedure specified in S22.5.


S22.5 *Test procedure for determining stages of air bag systems subject to low risk deployment (low speed crashes) test requirement.*

S22.5.1 The test described in S22.5.2 shall be conducted with an unbelted 50th percentile adult male test dummy in the driver's seating position according to S8 as it applies to that seating position and an unbelted 5th percentile adult female test dummy either in any front outboard passenger vehicle seating position according to S16 as it applies to that seating position or at any fore-aft seat position on any passenger side.


S22.5.2 Impact the vehicle traveling longitudinally forward at any speed, up to and including 26 km/h (16 mph) into a fixed rigid barrier that is perpendicular ±5 degrees to the line of travel of the vehicle under the applicable conditions of S8, S10, and S16 excluding S10.7, S10.8, S10.9, and S16.3.5.


S22.5.3 Determine which inflation stage or combination of stages are fired and determine the time delay between successive stages. That stage or combination of stages, with time delay between successive stages, shall be used in deploying the air bag when conducting the low risk deployment tests described in S22.4, S24.4, and S26.


S22.5.4 If the air bag does not deploy in the impact described in S22.5.2, the low risk deployment tests described in S22.4, S24.4, and S26 shall be conducted with all stages using the maximum time delay between stages.


S23 *Requirements using 6-year-old child dummies.*

S23.1 Each vehicle that is certified as complying with S14 shall, at the option of the manufacturer, meet the requirements specified in S23.2, S23.3, or S23.4, under the test procedures specified in S24 or S28, as applicable.


S23.2 *Option 1—Automatic suppression feature.* Each vehicle shall meet the requirements specified in S23.2.1 through S23.2.3.


S23.2.1 The vehicle shall be equipped with an automatic suppression feature for any front outboard passenger frontal air bag system which results in deactivation of the air bag during each of the static tests specified in S24.2 (using the 49 CFR part 572 subpart N 6-year-old child dummy in any of the child restraints specified in section D of appendix A or A-1 of this standard, as appropriate), and activation of the air bag system during each of the static tests specified in S24.3 (using the 49 CFR part 572 subpart O 5th percentile adult female dummy).


S23.2.2 The vehicle shall be equipped with a telltale light meeting the requirements specified in S19.2.2.


S23.2.3 The vehicle shall be equipped with a mechanism that indicates whether the air bag is suppressed, regardless of whether any front outboard passenger seat is occupied. The mechanism need not be located in the occupant compartment unless it is the telltale described in S23.2.2.


S23.3 *Option 2—Dynamic automatic suppression system that suppresses the air bag when an occupant is out of position.* (This option is available under the conditions set forth in S27.1.) The vehicle shall be equipped with a dynamic automatic suppression system for any front outboard passenger frontal air bag system which meets the requirements specified in S27.


S23.4 *Option 3—Low risk deployment.* Each vehicle shall meet the injury criteria specified in S23.5 of this standard when any front outboard passenger air bag is statically deployed in accordance with both of the low risk deployment test procedures specified in S24.4.


S23.5 *Injury criteria for the 49 CFR part 572 subpart N 6-year-old child dummy.*

S23.5.1 All portions of the test dummy shall be contained within the outer surfaces of the vehicle passenger compartment.


S23.5.2 *Head injury criteria.*

(a) For any two points in time, t_1_ and t_2_, during the event which are separated by not more than a 15 millisecond time interval and where t_1_ is less than t_2_, the head injury criterion (HIC_15_) shall be determined using the resultant head acceleration at the center of gravity of the dummy head, a_r_, expressed as a multiple of g (the acceleration of gravity) and shall be calculated using the expression:


(b) The maximum calculated HIC_15_ value shall not exceed 700.


S23.5.3 The resultant acceleration calculated from the output of the thoracic instrumentation shall not exceed 60 g's, except for intervals whose cumulative duration is not more than 3 milliseconds.


S23.5.4 Compression deflection of the sternum relative to the spine, as determined by instrumentation, shall not exceed 40 mm (l.6 in).


S23.5.5 *Neck injury.* When measuring neck injury, each of the following injury criteria shall be met.


(a) *Nij.*

(1) The shear force (Fx), axial force (Fz), and bending moment (My) shall be measured by the dummy upper neck load cell for the duration of the crash event as specified in S4.11. Shear force, axial force, and bending moment shall be filtered for Nij purposes at SAE Recommended Practice J211/1 MAR95 (incorporated by reference, see § 571.5) Channel Frequency Class 600.


(2) During the event, the axial force (Fz) can be either in tension or compression while the occipital condyle bending moment (Mocy) can be in either flexion or extension. This results in four possible loading conditions for Nij: tension-extension (Nte), tension-flexion (Ntf), compression-extension (Nce), or compression-flexion (Ncf).


(3) When calculating Nij using equation S23.5.5(a)(4), the critical values, Fzc and Myc, are: 


(i) Fzc = 2800 N (629 lbf) when Fz is in tension


(ii) Fzc = 2800 N (629 lbf) when Fz is in compression


(iii) Myc = 93 Nm (69 lbf-ft) when a flexion moment exists at the occipital condyle


(iv) Myc = 37 Nm (27 lbf-ft) when an extension moment exists at the occipital condyle.


(4) At each point in time, only one of the four loading conditions occurs and the Nij value corresponding to that loading condition is computed and the three remaining loading modes shall be considered a value of zero. The expression for calculating each Nij loading condition is given by:


(5) None of the four Nij values shall exceed 1.0 at any time during the event.


(b) *Peak tension.* Tension force (Fz), measured at the upper neck load cell, shall not exceed 1490 N (335 lbf) at any time.


(c) *Peak compression.* Compression force (Fz), measured at the upper neck load cell, shall not exceed 1820 N (409 lbf) at any time.


S23.5.6 Unless otherwise indicated, instrumentation for data acquisition, data channel frequency class, and moment calculations are the same as given for the 49 CFR part 572 subpart N 6-year-old child test dummy.


S24 *Test procedure for S23.*

S24.1 *General provisions and definitions.*

S24.1.1 Tests specifying the use of a booster seat may be conducted using any such restraint listed in section D of appendix A or A-1 of this standard, as appropriate. The booster seat may be unused or have been previously used only for automatic suppression tests. If it has been used, there shall not be any visible damage prior to the test. Booster seats are to be used in the manner appropriate for a 6-year-old child of the same height and weight as the 6-year-old child dummy.


S24.1.2 Unless otherwise specified, each vehicle certified to this option shall comply in tests conducted with any front outboard passenger seating position at the mid-height, in the full rearward seat track position, the middle seat track position, and the full forward seat track position as determined in this section. Using only the control that primarily moves the seat in the fore and aft direction, determine the full rearward, middle, and full forward positions of the SCRP. Using any seat or seat cushion adjustments other than that which primarily moves the seat fore-aft, determine the SCRP mid-point height for each of the three fore-aft test positions, while maintaining as closely as possible, the seat cushion angle determined in S16.2.10.3.1. Set the seat back angle, if adjustable independent of the seat, at the manufacturer's nominal design seat back angle for a 50th percentile adult male as specified in S8.1.3. If the dummy contacts the vehicle interior, move the seat rearward to the next detent that provides clearance. If the seat is a power seat, move the seat rearward while assuring that there is a maximum of 5 mm (0.2 in) distance between the vehicle interior and the point on the dummy that would first contact the vehicle interior.


S24.1.3 Except as otherwise specified, if the booster seat has an anchorage system as specified in S5.9 of FMVSS No. 213 and is used under this standard in testing a vehicle with any front outboard passenger vehicle seat that has an anchorage system as specified in FMVSS No. 225, the vehicle shall comply with the belted test conditions with the restraint anchorage system attached to the FMVSS No. 225 vehicle seat anchorage system and the vehicle seat belt unattached. It shall also comply with the belted test conditions with the restraint anchorage system unattached to the FMVSS No. 225 vehicle seat anchorage system and the vehicle seat belt attached. The vehicle shall comply with the unbelted test conditions with the restraint anchorage system unattached to the FMVSS No. 225 vehicle seat anchorage system.


S24.1.4 Do not attach any tethers.


S24.1.5 The definitions provided in S16.3.1 through S16.3.10 apply to the tests specified in S24.


S24.1.6 For leg and thigh angles, use the following references:


S24.1.6.1 *Thigh*—a straight line on the thigh skin between the center of the 5/16-18 UNC-2B threaded access hole in the upper leg clamp (drawing 127-4004, 6 YR H3—upper leg clamp) and the knee screw (part 9000248 in drawing 127-4000-1 & -2, leg assembly).


S24.1.6.2 *Leg*—a straight line on the leg skin between the center of the lower leg screw (part 9001170 in drawing 127-4000-1 & -2, leg assembly) and the knee screw (part 9000248 in drawing 127-4000-1 & -2, leg assembly).


S24.2 *Static tests of automatic suppression feature which shall result in deactivation of any passenger air bag, associated with that designated seating position.* Each vehicle that is certified as complying with S23.2 of FMVSS No. 208 shall meet the following test requirements with the child restraint in any front outboard passenger vehicle seat under the following conditions:


(a) Using the vehicle safety belts as specified in S22.2.1.5 with section D child restraints designed to be secured to the vehicle seat even when empty;


(b) If the child restraint is certified to S5.9 of § 571.213, and the vehicle seat has an anchorage system as specified in § 571.225, using only the mechanism provided by the child restraint manufacturer for attachment to the lower anchorage as specified in S22.2.1.6; and


(c) Without securing the child restraint with either the vehicle safety belts or any mechanism provided with a child restraint certified to S5.9 of § 571.213.


S24.2.1 Except as provided in S24.2.2, conduct all tests as specified in S22.2, except that the 49 CFR part 572 subpart N 6-year-old child dummy shall be used.


S24.2.2 *Exceptions.* The tests specified in the following paragraphs of S22.2 need not be conducted: S22.2.1.7, S22.2.2.3, S22.2.2.5, S22.2.2.6, S22.2.2.7, and S22.2.2.8.


S24.2.3 *Sitting back in the seat and leaning on any front outboard passenger door.*

(a) Place the dummy in the seated position in any front outboard passenger vehicle seat. For bucket seats, position the midsagittal plane of the dummy vertically such that it coincides with the longitudinal centerline of the seat cushion, within ±10 mm (±0.4 in). For bench seats in vehicles with manually operated driving controls, position the midsagittal plane of the dummy vertically and parallel to the vehicle's longitudinal centerline and the same distance from the longitudinal centerline of the vehicle, within ±10 mm (±0.4 in), as the center of rotation of the steering control. For bench seats in vehicles without manually operated driving controls, position the midsagittal plane of any front outboard dummy vertically and parallel to the vehicle's longitudinal centerline, within ±10 mm (±0.4 in) of the seating reference point of the seat that it occupies.


(b) Place the dummy's back against the seat back and rest the dummy's thighs on the seat cushion.


(c) Allow the legs and feet of the dummy to extend off the surface of the seat. If this positioning of the dummy's legs is prevented by contact with the instrument panel, using only the control that primarily moves the seat fore and aft, move the seat rearward to the next detent that provides clearance. If the seat is a power seat, move the seat rearward, while assuring that there is a maximum of 5 mm (0.2 in) distance between the vehicle interior and the part of the dummy that was in contact with the vehicle interior.


(d) Rotate the dummy's upper arms toward the seat back until they make contact.


(e) Rotate the dummy's lower arms down until they contact the seat.


(f) Close the vehicle's passenger-side door and then start the vehicle engine or place the ignition in the “on” position, whichever will turn on the suppression system.


(g) Push against the dummy's left shoulder to lean the dummy against the door; close all remaining doors.


(h) Wait ten seconds, then check whether the air bag is deactivated.


S24.3 *Static tests of automatic suppression feature which shall result in activation of any front outboard passenger air bag system.*

S24.3.1 Each vehicle certified to this option shall comply in tests conducted with any front outboard passenger seating position at the mid-height, in the full rearward and middle positions determined in S24.1.2, and the forward position determined in S16.3.3.1.8.


S24.3.2 Place a 49 CFR part 572 subpart O 5th percentile adult female test dummy at any front outboard passenger seating position of the vehicle, in accordance with procedures specified in S16.3.3 of this standard, except as specified in S24.3.1. Do not fasten the seat belt.


S24.3.3 Start the vehicle engine or place the ignition in the “on” position, whichever will turn on the suppression system, and then close all vehicle doors.


S24.3.4 Wait 10 seconds, then check whether the air bag system is activated.


S24.4 *Low risk deployment tests.*

S24.4.1 Each vehicle that is certified as complying with S23.4 shall meet the following test requirements with the 49 CFR part 572, subpart N 6-year-old child dummy in both of the following positions: Position 1 (S24.4.2) or Position 2 (S24.4.3).


S24.4.1.1 Locate and mark a point on the front of the dummy's chest jacket on the midsagittal plane that is 139 mm (5.5 in) ±3 mm (±0.1in) along the surface of the skin from the top of the skin at the neckline. This is referred to as “Point 1.”


S24.4.1.2 Mark a point on the instrument panel that is longitudinally and transversely, as measured along the surface of the instrument panel, within ±6 mm (±0.2 in) of the point that is defined by the intersection of the instrument panel and a line between the volumetric center of the smallest volume that can encompass the folded undeployed air bag and the volumetric center of the static fully inflated air bag.


S22.4.1.3 Locate the vertical plane parallel to the vehicle longitudinal centerline through the point located in S24.4.1.2. This is referred to as “Plane D.”


S24.4.1.4 Locate the horizontal plane through the point located in S24.4.1.2. This is referred to as “Plane C.”


S24.4.2 *Position 1 (chest on instrument panel).*

S24.4.2.1 Set the seat and seat cushion in the positions determined in S16.2.10.3.1. If the seat back is adjustable independent of the seat, place the seat back at the manufacturer's nominal design seat back angle for a 50th percentile adult male as specified in S8.1.3. Position any adjustable parts of the seat that provide additional support so that they are in the lowest or most open adjustment position. If adjustable, set the head restraint in the lowest and most forward position.


S24.4.2.2 Remove the legs of the dummy at the pelvic interface.


S24.4.2.3 Place the dummy in any front outboard passenger seat such that:


(a) The midsagittal plane is coincident with Plane D within ±10 mm (±0.4 in).


(b) The upper arms are parallel to the torso and the hands are next to where the thighs would be.


(c) Without changing the seat position and with the dummy's thorax instrument cavity rear face 6 degrees forward of the vertical, move the dummy forward until the dummy head/torso contacts the instrument panel. If the dummy loses contact with the seat cushion because of the forward movement, maintain the height of the dummy while moving the dummy forward. If the head contacts the windshield before head/torso contact with the instrument panel, maintain the thorax instrument cavity angle and move the dummy forward such that the head is following the angle of the windshield until there is head/torso contact with the instrument panel. Once contact is made, raise or lower the dummy vertically until Point 1 lies in Plane C within ±10 mm (±0.4 in). If the dummy's head contacts the windshield and keeps Point 1 from reaching Plane C, lower the dummy until there is no more than 5 mm (0.2 in) clearance between the head and the windshield. (The dummy shall remain in contact with the instrument panel while being raised or lowered which may change the dummy's fore-aft position.)


S24.4.2.4 If necessary, material with a maximum breaking strength of 311 N (70 lb) and spacer blocks may be used to support the dummy in position. The material should support the torso rather than the head. Support the dummy so that there is minimum interference with the full rotational and translational freedom for the upper torso of the dummy and the material does not interfere with the air bag.


S24.4.3 *Position 2 (head on instrument panel).*

S24.4.3.1 Place any front outboard passenger seat at the mid-height full rearward seating position determined in S24.1.2. Place the seat back, if adjustable independent of the seat, at the manufacturer's nominal design seat back angle for a 50th percentile adult male as specified in S8.1.3. Position any adjustable parts of the seat that provide additional support so that they are in the lowest or most open adjustment position. Position an adjustable head restraint in the lowest and most forward position.


S24.4.3.2 Place the dummy in any front outboard passenger seat such that:


(a) The midsagittal plane is coincident with Plane D within ±10 mm (±0.4 in).


(b) The legs are perpendicular to the floor pan, the back of the legs are in contact with the seat cushion, and the dummy's thorax instrument cavity rear face is 6 degrees forward of vertical. If it is not possible to position the dummy with the legs in the prescribed position, rotate the legs forward until the dummy is resting on the seat with the feet positioned flat on the floor pan and the back of the legs are in contact with the front of the seat cushion. Set the transverse distance between the longitudinal centerlines at the front of the dummy's knees at 112 to 117 mm (4.4 to 4.6 in), with the thighs and the legs of the dummy in vertical planes.


(c) The upper arms are parallel to the torso and the hands are in contact with the thighs.


S24.4.3.3 Using only the control that primarily moves the seat in the fore and aft direction, move the seat forward, while maintaining the thorax instrument cavity rear face orientation until any part of the dummy contacts the vehicle's instrument panel.


S24.4.3.4 If dummy contact has not been made with the vehicle's instrument panel at the full forward seating position of the seat, slide the dummy forward on the seat until contact is made. Maintain the thorax instrument cavity rear face orientation. If the dummy loses contact with the seat, from that point forward maintain the height of the dummy. Except as provided in S24.4.3.5, maintain the angle of the thigh with respect to the horizontal.


S24.4.3.5 If head/torso contact with the instrument panel has not been made, maintain the angle of the thighs with respect to the horizontal while applying a force towards the front of the vehicle on the spine of the dummy between the shoulder joints, perpendicular to the thorax instrument cavity rear face, until the head or torso comes into contact with the vehicle's instrument panel or until a maximum force of 222 N (50 lb) is achieved. If the head/torso is still not in contact with the instrument panel, hold the femurs and release the 222 N (50 lb) force. While maintaining the relative angle between the torso and the femurs, roll the dummy forward on the seat cushion, without sliding, until head/torso contact with the instrument panel is achieved. If seat contact is lost prior to or during femur rotation out of the horizontal plane, constrain the dummy to rotate about the dummy H-point. If the dummy cannot be rolled forward on the seat due to contact of the dummy feet with the floor pan, extend the lower legs forward, at the knees, until floor pan contact is avoided.


S24.4.3.6 If necessary, material with a maximum breaking strength of 311 N (70 lb) and spacer blocks may be used to support the dummy in position. The material should support the torso rather than the head. Support the dummy so that there is minimum interference with the full rotational and translational freedom for the upper torso of the dummy and the material does not interfere with the air bag.


S24.4.4 Deploy any front outboard passenger frontal air bag system. If the frontal air bag system contains a multistage inflator, the vehicle shall be able to comply with the injury criteria at any stage or combination of stages or time delay between successive stages that could occur in a rigid barrier crash test at or below 26 km/h (16 mph), under the test procedure specified in S22.5.


S25 *Requirements using an out-of-position 5th percentile adult female dummy at the driver position.*

S25.1 Each vehicle certified as complying with S14 shall, at the option of the manufacturer, meet the requirements specified in S25.2 or S25.3 under the test procedures specified in S26 or S28, as appropriate.


S25.2 *Option 1—Dynamic automatic suppression system that suppresses the air bag when the driver is out of position.* (This option is available under the conditions set forth in S27.1.) The vehicle shall be equipped with a dynamic automatic suppression system for the driver air bag which meets the requirements specified in S27.


S25.3 *Option 2—Low risk deployment.* Each vehicle shall meet the injury criteria specified by S15.3 of this standard, except as modified in S25.4, when the driver air bag is statically deployed in accordance with both of the low risk deployment test procedures specified in S26.


S25.4 *Neck injury criteria driver low risk deployment tests.* When measuring neck injury in low risk deployment tests for the driver position, each of the following neck injury criteria shall be met.


(a) *Nij.*

(1) The shear force (Fx), axial force (Fz), and bending moment (My) shall be measured by the dummy upper neck load cell for the duration of the crash event as specified in S4.11. Shear force, axial force, and bending moment shall be filtered for Nij purposes at SAE Recommended Practice J211/1 MAR95 (incorporated by reference, see § 571.5) Channel Frequency Class 600.


(2) During the event, the axial force (Fz) can be either in tension or compression while the occipital condyle bending moment (Mocy) can be in either flexion or extension. This results in four possible loading conditions for Nij: tension-extension (Nte), tension-flexion (Ntf), compression-extension (Nce), or compression-flexion (Ncf).


(3) When calculating Nij using equation S25.4(a)(4), the critical values, Fzc and Myc, are:


(i) Fzc = 3880 N (872 lbf) when Fz is in tension


(ii) Fzc = 3880 N (872 lbf) when Fz is in compression


(iii) Myc = 155 Nm (114 lbf-ft) when a flexion moment exists at the occipital condyle


(iv) Myc = 61 Nm (45 lbf-ft) when an extension moment exists at the occipital condyle.


(4) At each point in time, only one of the four loading conditions occurs and the Nij value corresponding to that loading condition is computed and the three remaining loading modes shall be considered a value of zero. The expression for calculating each Nij loading condition is given by:


(5) None of the four Nij values shall exceed 1.0 at any time during the event.


(b) *Peak tension.* Tension force (Fz), measured at the upper neck load cell, shall not exceed 2070 N (465 lbf) at any time.


(c) *Peak compression.* Compression force (Fz), measured at the upper neck load cell, shall not exceed 2520 N (566 lbf) at any time.


(d) Unless otherwise indicated, instrumentation for data acquisition, data channel frequency class, and moment calculations are the same as given in 49 CFR part 572 subpart O 5th percentile female test dummy.


S26 *Procedure for low risk deployment tests of driver air bag.*

S26.1 Each vehicle that is certified as complying with S25.3 shall meet the requirements of S25.3 and S25.4 with the 49 CFR part 572 subpart O 5th percentile adult female dummy in both of the following positions: Driver position 1 (S26.2) and Driver position 2 (S26.3).


S26.2 *Driver position 1 (chin on module).*

S26.2.1 Adjust the steering controls so that the steering control hub is at the geometric center of the locus it describes when it is moved through its full range of driving positions. If there is no setting at the geometric center, position it one setting lower than the geometric center. Set the rotation of the steering control so that the vehicle wheels are pointed straight ahead.


S26.2.2 Mark a point on the steering control cover that is longitudinally and transversely, as measured along the surface of the steering control cover, within ±6 mm (±0.2 in) of the point that is defined by the intersection of the steering control cover and a line between the volumetric center of the smallest volume that can encompass the folded undeployed air bag and the volumetric center of the static fully inflated air bag. Locate the vertical plane parallel to the vehicle longitudinal centerline through the point located on the steering control cover. This is referred to as “Plane E.”


S26.2.3 Place the seat and seat cushion in the position achieved in S16.2.10.3.1. If the seat or seat cushion is adjustable in the vertical direction by adjustments other than that which primarily moves the seat or seat cushion fore-aft, determine the maximum and minimum heights of the SCRP at this position, while maintaining the seat cushion reference line angle as closely as possible. Place the SCRP in the mid-height position. If the seat back is adjustable independent of the seat, place the seat back at the manufacturer's nominal design seat back angle for a 50th percentile adult male as specified in S8.1.3. Position any adjustable parts of the seat that provide additional support so that they are in the lowest or most open adjustment position. Position an adjustable head restraint in the lowest and most forward position.


S26.2.4 Place the dummy in the driver's seat such that:


S26.2.4.1 The midsagittal plane is coincident with Plane E within ±10 mm (±0.4 in).


S26.2.4.2 The legs are perpendicular to the floor pan and the back of the legs are in contact with the seat cushion. The legs may be adjusted if necessary to achieve the final head position.


S26.2.4.3 The dummy's thorax instrument cavity rear face is 6 degrees forward (toward the front of the vehicle) of the steering control angle (*i.e.,* if the steering control angle is 25 degrees from vertical, the thorax instrument cavity rear face angle is 31 degrees).


S26.2.4.4 The initial transverse distance between the longitudinal centerlines at the front of the dummy's knees is 160 to 170 mm (6.3 to 6.7 in), with the thighs and legs of the dummy in vertical planes.


S26.2.4.5 The upper arms are parallel to the torso and the hands are in contact with the thighs.


S26.2.5 Maintaining the spine angle, slide the dummy forward until the head/torso contacts the steering control.


S26.2.6 While maintaining the spine angle, adjust the height of the dummy so that the bottom of the chin is in the same horizontal plane as the highest point of the air bag module cover (dummy height can be adjusted using the seat height adjustments and/or spacer blocks). If the seat prevents the bottom of the chin from being in the same horizontal plane as the module cover, adjust the dummy height to as close to the prescribed position as possible. 


S26.2.7 If necessary, material with a maximum breaking strength of 311 N (70 lb) and spacer blocks may be used to support the dummy in position. The material should support the torso rather than the head. Support the dummy so that there is minimum interference with the full rotational and translational freedom for the upper torso of the dummy and the material does not interfere with the air bag.


S26.3 *Driver position 2 (chin on rim).*

S26.3.1 Place the seat and seat cushion in the position achieved in S16.2.10.3.1. If the seat or seat cushion is adjustable in the vertical direction by adjustments other than that which primarily moves the seat or seat cushion fore-aft, determine the maximum and minimum heights of the SCRP at this position, while maintaining the seat cushion reference line angle as closely as possible. Place the SCRP in the mid-height position. If the seat back is adjustable independent of the seat, place the seat back at the manufacturer's nominal design seat back angle for a 50th percentile adult male as specified in S8.1.3. Position any adjustable parts of the seat that provide additional support so that they are in the lowest or most open adjustment position. Position an adjustable head restraint in the lowest position.


S26.3.2 Adjust the steering controls so that the steering control hub is at the geometric center of the locus it describes when it is moved through its full range of driving positions. If there is no setting at the geometric center, position it one setting lower than the geometric center. Set the rotation of the steering control so that the vehicle wheels are pointed straight ahead.


S26.3.3 Mark a point on the steering control cover that is longitudinally and transversely, as measured along the surface of the steering control cover, within ±6 mm (±0.2 in) of the point that is defined by the intersection of the steering control cover and a line between the volumetric center of the smallest volume that can encompass the folded undeployed air bag and the volumetric center of the static fully inflated air bag. Locate the vertical plane parallel to the vehicle longitudinal centerline through the point located on the steering control cover. This is referred to as “Plane E.”


S26.3.4 Place the dummy in the driver's seat position such that:


S26.3.4.1 The midsagittal plane is coincident with Plane E within ±10 mm (±0.4 in).


S26.3.4.2 The legs are perpendicular to the floor pan and the back of the legs are in contact with the seat cushion. The legs may be adjusted if necessary to achieve the final head position.


S26.3.4.3 The dummy's thorax instrument cavity rear face is 6 degrees forward (toward the front of the vehicle) of the steering control angle (*i.e.,* if the steering control angle is 25 degrees from vertical, the thorax instrument cavity rear face angle is 31 degrees).


S26.3.4.4 The initial transverse distance between the longitudinal centerlines at the front of the dummy's knees is 160 to 170 mm (6.3 to 6.7 in), with the thighs and legs of the dummy in vertical planes.


S26.3.4.5 The upper arms are parallel to the torso and the hands are in contact with the thighs.


S26.3.5 Maintaining the spine angle, slide the dummy forward until the head/torso contacts the steering control.


S26.3.6 While maintaining the spine angle, position the dummy so that a point on the chin 40 mm (1.6 in) ±3 mm (±0.1 in) below the center of the mouth (chin point) is, within ±10 mm (±0.4 in), in contact with a point on the steering control rim surface closest to the dummy that is 10 mm (0.4 in) vertically below the highest point on the rim in Plane E. If the dummy's head contacts the vehicle windshield or upper interior before the prescribed position can be obtained, lower the dummy until there is no more than 5 mm (0.2 in) clearance between the vehicle's windshield or upper interior, as applicable.


S26.3.7 If the steering control can be adjusted so that the chin point can be in contact with the rim of the uppermost portion of the steering control, adjust the steering control to that position. If the steering control contacts the dummy's leg(s) prior to attaining this position, adjust it to the next highest detent, or if infinitely adjustable, until there is a maximum of 5 mm (0.2 in) clearance between the control and the dummy's leg(s). Readjust the dummy's torso such that the thorax instrument cavity rear face is 6 degrees forward of the steering control angle. Position the dummy so that the chin point is in contact, or if contact is not achieved, as close as possible to contact with the rim of the uppermost portion of the steering control.


S26.3.8 If necessary, material with a maximum breaking strength of 311 N (70 lb) and spacer blocks may be used to support the dummy in position. The material should support the torso rather than the head. Support the dummy so that there is minimum interference with the full rotational and translational freedom for the upper torso of the dummy and the material does not interfere with the air bag.


S26.4 Deploy the driver frontal air bag system. If the frontal air bag system contains a multistage inflator, the vehicle shall be able to comply with the injury criteria at any stage or combination of stages or time delay between successive stages that could occur in a rigid barrier crash test at or below 26 km/h (16 mph), under the test procedure specified in S22.5.


S27 *Option for dynamic automatic suppression system that suppresses the air bag when an occupant is out-of-position.*

S27.1 *Availability of option.* This option is available for either air bag, singly or in conjunction, subject to the requirements of S27, if: 


(a) A petition for rulemaking to establish dynamic automatic suppression system test procedures is submitted pursuant to subpart B of part 552 and a test procedure applicable to the vehicle is added to S28 pursuant to the procedures specified by that subpart, or


(b) A test procedure applicable to the vehicle is otherwise added to S28. 


S27.2 *Definitions.* For purposes of S27 and S28, the following definitions apply: 


*Automatic suppression zone or ASZ* means a three-dimensional zone adjacent to the air bag cover, specified by the vehicle manufacturer, where the deployment of the air bag will be suppressed by the DASS if a vehicle occupant enters the zone under specified conditions. 


*Dynamic automatic suppression system or DASS* means a portion of an air bag system that automatically controls whether or not the air bag deploys during a crash by: 


(1) Sensing the location of an occupant, moving or still, in relation to the air bag; 


(2) Interpreting the occupant characteristics and location information to determine whether or not the air bag should deploy; and


(3) Activating or suppressing the air bag system based on the interpretation of occupant characteristics and location information. 


S27.3 *Requirements.* Each vehicle shall, at each applicable front outboard designated seating position, when tested under the conditions of S28 of this standard, comply with the requirements specified in S27.4 through S27.6. 


S27.4 Each vehicle shall be equipped with a DASS. 


S27.5 *Static test requirement (low risk deployment for occupants outside the ASZ).*

S27.5.1 *Driver (49 CFR part 572 subpart O 5th percentile female dummy).* Each vehicle shall meet the injury criteria specified in S15.3 of this standard when the driver air bag is deployed in accordance with the procedures specified in S28.1.

S28.1 *Driver suppression zone verification test (49 CFR part 572 Subpart O 5th percentile female dummy).* [Reserved]


S28.2 Front outboard *passenger suppression zone verification test (49 CFR part 572 subpart P 3-year-old child dummy and 49 CFR part 572 subpart N 6-year-old child dummies).* [Reserved]


S28.3 *Driver dynamic test procedure for DASS requirements.* [Reserved]


S28.4 Front outboard *passenger dynamic test procedure for DASS requirements.* [Reserved]


S29 *Manufacturer option to certify vehicles to certain static suppression test requirements using human beings rather than test dummies.*

S29.1 At the option of the manufacturer, instead of using test dummies in conducting the tests for the following automatic suppression and occupant recognition parts of the low risk deployment test requirements, human beings may be used as specified. If human beings are used, they shall assume, to the extent possible, the final physical position specified for the corresponding dummies for each test.


(a) If a manufacturer decides to certify a vehicle using a human being for a test of the passenger automatic suppression, it shall use humans for the entire series of tests, e.g., 3-year-old children for each test of the system involving 3-year-old test dummies. If a manufacturer decides to certify a vehicle using a test dummy for a test of the system, it shall use test dummies for the entire series of tests, e.g., a Hybrid III 3-year-old child dummy for each test of the system involving 3-year-old child test dummies.


(b) For S19.2, instead of using the 49 CFR part 572 subpart R 12-month-old child dummy, a human child who weighs between 8.2 and 9.1 kg (18 and 20 lb), and who is between 61 and 66 cm (24 and 26 in) tall may be used.


(c) For S19.2, instead of using the 49 CFR part 572 subpart K newborn infant dummy, a human child who weighs between 8.2 and 9.1 kg (18 and 20 lb), and who is between 61 and 66 cm (24 and 26 in) tall may be used.
