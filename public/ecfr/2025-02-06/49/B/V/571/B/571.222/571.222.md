(c) The force shall be applied at an onset rate of not more than 133,440 Newtons per second.


(d) The 13,344 Newton force shall be attained in not more than 30 seconds, and shall be maintained for 10 seconds.


(e) When a wheelchair securement device and an occupant restraint share a common anchorage, including occupant restraint designs that attach the occupant restraint to the securement device or the wheelchair, the loads specified by S5.4.1.3 and S5.4.3.2 shall be applied simultaneously, under the conditions specified in S5.4.3.2 (a) and (b). (See Figure 6.)


S5.4.3.3 Each anchorage for a wheelchair occupant upper torso restraint shall be capable of withstanding a force of 6,672 Newtons applied as specified in paragraphs (a) through (d).


(a) The initial application force shall be applied at a vertical angle of not less than zero degrees, but not more than 40 degrees, below a horizontal plane which passes through the anchorage. (See Figure 7.)


(b) The projection of the force direction onto the horizontal plane shall be within zero degrees and 45 degrees as measured from a longitudinal line with its origin at the anchorage and projecting forward. (See Figure 7.)


(c) The force shall be applied at the onset rate of not more than 66,720 Newtons per second.


(d) The 6,672 Newton force shall be attained in not more than 30 seconds, and shall be maintained for 10 seconds.


S5.4.4 *Wheelchair occupant restraints.*

(a) Each wheelchair location shall have wheelchair occupant pelvic and upper torso restraints attached to the anchorages required by S5.4.3.


(b) Each wheelchair occupant restraint shall comply with the requirements for Type 2 safety belt systems in S4.2, S4.3, and S4.4(b) of FMVSS No. 209, *Seat Belt Assemblies.*

S5.5 *Labeling.* (a) A small occupant seating position must be permanently and legibly marked or labeled with the phrase: “Do Not Sit In Middle Seat If Over Age 10”. The phrase must be comprised of no more than two lines of text. The label must be placed on the torso belt portion of the Type 2 seat belt. It must be plainly visible and easily readable when the seat belt is in a stored position. The distance from the top edge of the top line of text to the bottom edge of the bottom line of text must be at least 35 mm. If the label is sewn on, it must be stitched around its entire perimeter.


(b) [Reserved] 


S6. *Test conditions.* The following conditions apply to the requirements specified in S5.


S6.1 *Test surface.* The bus is at rest on a level surface.


S6.2 *Tires.* Tires are inflated to the pressure specified by the manufacturer for the gross vehicle weight rating.


S6.3 *Temperature.* The ambient temperature is any level between 0 degrees C and 32 degrees C.


S6.4 *Seat back position.* If adjustable, a seat back is adjusted to its most upright position.


S6.5 *Loading bar.* The loading bar is a rigid cylinder with an outside diameter of 152 mm that has hemispherical ends with radii of 76 mm and with a surface roughness that does not exceed 1.6 µm, root mean square. The length of the loading bar is 102 mm less than the width of the seat back in each test. The stroking mechanism applies force through a pivot attachment at the center point of the loading bar which allows the loading bar to rotate in a horizontal plane 30 degrees in either direction from the transverse position.


S6.5.1 A vertical or lateral force of 17,792 N applied externally through the pivot attachment point of the loading bar at any position reached during a test specified in this standard shall not deflect that point more than 25 mm.


S6.6 *Head form.* The head form for the measurement of acceleration is a rigid surface comprised of two hemispherical shapes, with total equivalent mass of 5.2 kg. The first of the two hemispherical shapes has a diameter of 166 mm. The second of the two hemispherical shapes has a 50 mm diameter and is centered as shown in Figure 3 to protrude from the outer surface of the first hemispherical shape. The surface roughness of the hemispherical shapes does not exceed 1.6 µm, root mean square.


S6.6.1 The direction of travel of the head form is coincidental with the straight line connecting the centerpoints of the two spherical outer surfaces which constitute the head form shape.


S6.6.2 The head form is instrumented with an acceleration sensing device whose output is recorded in a data channel that conforms to the requirements for a 1,000 Hz channel class as specified in SAE Recommended Practice J211a (1971) (incorporated by reference, see § 571.5). The head form exhibits no resonant frequency below three times the frequency of the channel class. The axis of the acceleration sensing device coincides with the straight line connecting the centerpoints of the two hemispherical outer surfaces which constitute the head form shape.


S6.6.3 The head form is guided by a stroking device so that the direction of travel of the head form is not affected by impact with the surface being tested at the levels called for in the standard.


S6.7 *Knee form.* The knee form for measurement of force is a rigid 76 millimeter-diameter cylinder, with an equivalent weight of 44 N that has one hemispherical end with a 38 mm radius forming a contact surface of the knee form. The hemispherical surface roughness does not exceed 1.6 µm, root mean square.


S6.7.1 The direction of travel of the knee form is coincidental with the centerline of the rigid cylinder.


S6.7.2 The knee form is instrumented with an acceleration sensing device whose output is recorded in a data channel that conforms to the requirements of a 600 Hz channel class as specified in SAE Recommended Practice J211a (1971) (incorporated by reference, see § 571.5). The knee form exhibits no resonant frequency below three times the frequency of the channel class. The axis of the acceleration sensing device is aligned to measure acceleration along the centerline of the cylindrical knee form.


S6.7.3 The knee form is guided by a stroking device so that the direction of travel of the knee form is not affected by impact with the surface being tested at the levels called for in the standard.


S6.8 The head form, knee form, and contactable surfaces are clean and dry during impact testing.
