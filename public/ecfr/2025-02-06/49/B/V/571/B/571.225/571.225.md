# ยง 571.225   Standard No. 225; Child restraint anchorage systems.

S1. *Purpose and scope.* This standard establishes requirements for child restraint anchorage systems to ensure their proper location and strength for the effective securing of child restraints, to reduce the likelihood of the anchorage systems' failure, and to increase the likelihood that child restraints are properly secured and thus more fully achieve their potential effectiveness in motor vehicles.


S2. *Application.* This standard applies to passenger cars; to trucks and multipurpose passenger vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 3,855 kilograms (8,500 pounds) or less; and to buses (including school buses) with a GVWR of 4,536 kg (10,000 lb) or less. This standard does not apply to walk-in van-type vehicles, vehicles manufactured to be sold exclusively to the U.S. Postal Service, shuttle buses, and funeral coaches.


S3. *Definitions.*

*Child restraint anchorage* means any vehicle component, other than Type I or Type II seat belts, that is involved in transferring loads generated by a child restraint system to the vehicle structure.


*Child restraint anchorage system* means a vehicle system that is designed for attaching a child restraint system to a vehicle at a particular designated seating position, consisting of:


(a) Two lower anchorages meeting the requirements of S9; and


(b) A tether anchorage meeting the requirements of S6.


*Child restraint fixture (CRF)* means the fixture depicted in Figures 1 and 2 of this standard that simulates the dimensions of a child restraint system, and that is used to determine the space required by the child restraint system and the location and accessibility of the lower anchorages.


*Funeral coach* means a vehicle that contains only a front row of occupant seats, is designed exclusively for transporting a body and casket and that is equipped with features to secure a casket in place during operation of the vehicle.


*Rear designated seating position* means any designated seating position (as that term is defined at ยง 571.3) that is rearward of the front seats(s).


*Seat bight* means the area close to and including the intersection of the surfaces of the vehicle seat cushion and the seat back.


*SFAD 1* means Static Force Application Device 1 shown in Figures 12 to 16 of this standard.


*SFAD 2* means Static Force Application Device 2 shown in Figures 17 and 18 of this standard.


*Shuttle bus* means a bus with only one row of forward-facing seating positions rearward of the driver's seat or, for a vehicle without manually operated controls, means a bus with only one row of forward-facing seating positions rearward of all front row passenger seats.


*Tether anchorage* means a user-ready, permanently installed vehicle system that transfers loads from a tether strap through the tether hook to the vehicle structure and that accepts a tether hook.


*Tether strap* means a strap that is secured to the rigid structure of the seat back of a child restraint system, and is connected to a tether hook that transfers the load from that system to the tether anchorage.


*Tether hook* means a device, illustrated in Figure 11 of Standard No. 213 (ยง 571.213), used to attach a tether strap to a tether anchorage.

(c) Once accessed, be ready for use without the need for any tools; and


(d) Be sealed to prevent the entry of exhaust fumes into the passenger compartment.


S6.2 *Location of the tether anchorage.* A vehicle manufactured on or after September 1, 1999 and before September 1, 2004 may, at the manufacturer's option (with said option irrevocably selected prior to, or at the time of, certification of the vehicle), meet the requirements of S6.2.1 or S6.2.2. Vehicles manufactured on or after September 1, 2004 must meet the requirements of S6.2.1 of this standard. 


S6.2.1 Subject to S6.2.1.1 and S6.2.1.2, the part of each tether anchorage that attaches to a tether hook must be located within the shaded zone shown in Figures 3 to 7 of this standard of the designated seating position for which it is installed. The zone is defined with reference to the seating reference point (see ยง 571.3). (For purposes of the figures, โH Pointโ is defined to mean seating reference point.) A tether anchorage may be recessed in the seat back, provided that it is not in the strap wrap-around area at the top of the vehicle seat back. For the area under the vehicle seat, the forwardmost edge of the shaded zone is defined by the torso line reference plane.


S6.2.1.1 In the case of passenger cars and multipurpose passenger vehicles manufactured before September 1, 2004, the part of each user-ready tether anchorage that attaches to a tether hook may, at the manufacturer's option (with said option selected prior to, or at the time of, certification of the vehicle), instead of complying with S6.2.1, be located within the shaded zone shown in Figures 8 to 11 of this standard of the designated seating position for which it is installed, relative to the shoulder reference point of the three dimensional H-point machine described in section 3.1 of SAE Standard J826-1992 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 571.5) such thatโ


(a) The H-point of the three dimensional H-point machine is locatedโ


(1) At the actual H-point of the seat, as defined in section 2.2.11.3 of SAE Recommended Practice J1100-1993 (incorporated by reference, see ยง 571.5), at the full rearward and downward position of the seat; or


(2) In the case of a designated seating position that has a child restraint anchorage system, midway between vertical longitudinal planes passing through the lateral center of the bar in each of the two lower anchorages of that system; and


(b) The back pan of the H-point machine is at the same angle to the vertical as the vehicle seat back with the seat adjusted to its full rearward and full downward position and the seat back in its most upright position.


S6.2.1.2 In the case of a vehicle thatโ


(a) Has a user-ready tether anchorage for which no part of the shaded zone shown in Figures 3 to 7 of this standard of the designated seating position for which the anchorage is installed is accessible without removing a seating component of the vehicle; and


(b) Has a tether strap routing device that isโ


(1) Not less than 65 mm behind the torso line for that seating position, in the case of a flexible routing device or a deployable routing device, measured horizontally and in a vertical longitudinal plane; or

S6.3.4.4 The strength requirement tests shall be conducted with the vehicle seat adjusted to its full rearward and full downward position and the seat back in its most upright position. When SFAD 2 is used in testing and cannot be attached to the lower anchorages with the seat back in this position, adjust the seat back as recommended by the manufacturer in its instructions for attaching child restraints. If no instructions are provided, adjust the seat back to the position that enables SFAD 2 to attach to the lower anchorages that is the closest to the most upright position.


S7. *Test conditions for testing tether anchorages.*

The test conditions described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of S7 apply to the test procedures in S8.


(a) Vehicle seats are adjusted to their full rearward and full downward position and the seat back is placed in its most upright position. When SFAD 2 is used in testing and cannot be attached to the lower anchorages with the seat back in this position, adjust the seat back as recommended by the manufacturer in its instructions for attaching child restraints. If no instructions are provided, adjust the seat back to the position that enables SFAD 2 to attach to the lower anchorages that is the closest to the most upright position.


(b) Head restraints are adjusted in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, provided pursuant to S12, as to how the head restraints should be adjusted when using the child restraint anchorage system. If instructions with regard to head restraint adjustment are not provided pursuant to S12, the head restraints are adjusted to any position.


S8 *Test procedures.* Each vehicle shall meet the requirements of S6.3.1 and S6.3.3 when tested according to the following procedures. Where a range of values is specified, the vehicle shall be able to meet the requirements at all points within the range. For the testing specified in these procedures, the SFAD used in the test has a tether strap consisting of webbing material with an elongation limit of 4 percent at a tensile load of 65,000 N (14,612 lb). Pretension the tether strap with 53.5 N to 67 N of preload prior to the test. The strap is fitted at one end with a high strength steel tether hook for attachment to the tether anchorage. The tether hook meets the specifications in Standard No. 213 (49 CFR ยง 571.213) as to the configuration and geometry of tether hooks required by the standard. A steel cable is connected to the X point through which the test force is applied.


S8.1 Apply the force specified in S6.3.1 as followsโ


(a) Use the following specified test device, as appropriate:


(1) SFAD 1, to test a tether anchorage at a designated seating position that does not have a child restraint anchorage system; or,


(2) SFAD 2, to test a tether anchorage at a designated seating position that has a child restraint anchorage system.


(b) Attach the SFAD 1 to the vehicle seat using the vehicle belts or the SFAD 2 to the lower anchorages of the child restraint anchorage system, as appropriate, and attach the test device to the tether anchorage, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions provided pursuant to S12 of this standard. For the testing specified in this procedure, if SFAD 1 cannot be attached using the vehicle belts because of the location of the vehicle belt buckle, the test device is attached by material whose breaking strength is equal to or greater than the breaking strength of the webbing for the seat belt assembly installed as original equipment at that seating position.
