# § 572.81   General description.

(a) The dummy consists of: (1) The assembly specified in drawing LP 1049/A, March 1979, which is described in its entirety by means of approximately 54 separate drawings and specifications, 1049/1 through 1049/54; and (2) a parts list LP 1049/0 (5 sheets); and (3) a report entitled, “The TNO P3/4 Child Dummy Users Manual,” January 1979, published by Instituut voor Wegtransportmiddelen TNO.


(b) Adjacent dummy segments are joined in a manner such that throughout the range of motion and also under simulated crash-impact conditions there is no contact between metallic elements except for contacts that exist under static conditions.


(c) The structural properties of the dummy are such that the dummy conforms to this part in every respect both before and after being used in dynamic tests such as that specified in Standard No. 213 of this chapter (§ 571.213).
