# § 572.137   Test conditions and instrumentation.

(a) The test probe for thoracic impacts, except for attachments, shall be of rigid metallic construction and concentric about its longitudinal axis. Any attachments to the impactor, such as suspension hardware, impact vanes, etc., must meet the requirements of § 572.134(c)(7). The impactor shall have a mass of 13.97 ±0.23 kg (30.8 ±0.5 lbs) and a minimum mass moment of inertia of 3646 kg-cm
2 (3.22 lbs-in-sec
2) in yaw and pitch about the CG of the probe. One-third (1/3) of the weight of suspension cables and any attachments to the impact probe must be included in the calculation of mass, and such components may not exceed five percent of the total weight of the test probe. The impacting end of the probe, perpendicular to and concentric with the longitudinal axis of the probe, has a flat, continuous, and non-deformable 152.4 ±0.25 mm (6.00 ±0.01 in) diameter face with a minimum/maximum edge radius of 7.6/12.7 mm (0.3/0.5 in). The impactor shall have a 152.4-152.6 mm (6.0-6.1 in) diameter cylindrical surface extending for a minimum of 25 mm (1.0 in) to the rear from the impact face. The probe's end opposite to the impact face has provisions for mounting of an accelerometer with its sensitive axis collinear with the longitudinal axis of the probe. The impact probe has a free air resonant frequency of not less than 1000 Hz, which may be determined using the procedure listed in Docket No. NHTSA-6714-14. 


(b) The test probe for knee impacts, except for attachments, shall be of rigid metallic construction and concentric about its longitudinal axis. Any attachments to the impactor, such as suspension hardware, impact vanes, etc., must meet the requirements of § 572.136(c)(6). The impactor shall have a mass of 2.99±0.23 kg (6.6±0.5 lbs) and a minimum mass moment of inertia of 209 kg-cm
2 (0.177 lb-in-sec
2) in yaw and pitch about the CG of the probe. One-third (1/3) of the weight of suspension cables and any attachments to the impact probe may be included in the calculation of mass, and such components may not exceed five percent of the total weight of the test probe. The impacting end of the probe, perpendicular to and concentric with the longitudinal axis of the probe, has a flat, continuous, and non-deformable 76.2 ±0.2 mm (3.00 ±0.01 in) diameter face with a minimum/maximum edge radius of 7.6/12.7 mm (0.3/0.5 in). The impactor shall have a 76.2-76.4 mm (3.0-3.1 in) diameter cylindrical surface extending for a minimum of 12.5 mm (0.5 in) to the rear from the impact face. The probe's end opposite to the impact face has provisions for mounting an accelerometer with its sensitive axis collinear with the longitudinal axis of the probe. The impact probe has a free air resonant frequency of not less than 1000 Hz, which may be determined using the procedure listed in Docket No. NHTSA-6714-14.
