# § 572.154   Thorax assembly and test procedure.

(a) Thorax Assembly (refer to § 572.150(a)(1)(iv)) . The thorax consists of the part of the torso assembly shown in drawing 921022-060. 


(b) When the thorax of a completely assembled dummy (drawing 921022-000) is impacted by a test probe conforming to § 572.155(a) at 5.0 ±0.1m/s (16.5 ±0.3 ft/s) according to the test procedure in paragraph (c) of this section, the peak force, measured by the impact probe in accordance with paragraph § 572.155(a), shall be not less than 1514 N (340.7 lbf) and not more than 1796 N (404.1 lbf). 


(c) *Test procedure.* (1) Soak the dummy in a controlled environment at any temperature between 20.6 and 22.2 °C (69 and 72 °F) and at any relative humidity between 10 and 70 percent for at least four hours prior to a test. These temperature and humidity levels shall be maintained throughout the entire testing period specified in this section. 


(2) The test dummy is clothed in a cotton-polyester based tight fitting sweat shirt with long sleeves and ankle long pants whose combined weight is not more than 0.25 kg (.55 lbs). 


(3) Seat and orient the dummy on a level seating surface without back support as shown in Figure R5 of this subpart, with the lower limbs extended forward, parallel to the midsagittal plane and the arms 0 to 5 degrees forward of vertical. The dummy's midsagittal plane is vertical within ±/1 degree and the posterior surface of the upper spine box is aligned at 90 ±/1 degrees from the horizontal. (Shim material may be used under the upper legs to maintain the dummy's specified spine box surface alignment). 


(4) Establish the impact point at the chest midsagittal plane so that the impact point of the longitudinal centerline of the probe coincides with the dummy's midsagittal plane, is centered on the torso 196 ±/2.5 mm (7.7 ±/0.1 in) vertically from the plane of the seating surface, and is within 0.5 degrees of a horizontal plane. 


(5) Impact the thorax with the test probe so that at the moment of contact the probe's longitudinal center line falls within 2 degrees of a horizontal line in the dummy's midsagittal plane. 


(6) Guide the test probe during impact so that there is no significant lateral, vertical or rotational movement. 


(7) No suspension hardware, suspension cables, or any other attachments to the probe, including the velocity vane, shall make contact with the dummy during the test.
