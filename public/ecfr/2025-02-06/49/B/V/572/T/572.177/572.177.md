# § 572.177   Test conditions and instrumentation.

(a) The following test equipment and instrumentation is needed for qualification as set forth in this subpart:


(1) The test probe for thoracic impacts is of rigid metallic construction, concentric in shape, and symmetric about its longitudinal axis. It has a mass of 6.89 ±0.05 kg (15.2 ±0.1 lb) and a minimum mass moment of inertia of 2040 kg-cm
2 (1.81 lbf-in-sec
2) in yaw and pitch about the CG. One-third (
1/3) of the weight of the suspension cables and their attachments to the impact probe is included in the calculation of mass, and such components may not exceed five percent of the total weight of the test probe. The impacting end of the probe, perpendicular to and concentric with the longitudinal axis, is at least 25.4 mm (1.0 in) long, and has a flat, continuous, and non-deformable 121 ±0.25 mm (4.76 ±0.01 in) diameter face with a maximum edge radius of 12.7 mm (0.5 in). The probe's end opposite to the impact face has provisions for mounting of an accelerometer with its sensitive axis collinear with the longitudinal axis of the probe. No concentric portions of the impact probe may exceed the diameter of the impact face. The impact probe has a free air resonant frequency of not less than 1000 Hz, which may be determined using the procedure listed in the PADI (incorporated by reference, see § 572.170).


(2) The test probe for knee impacts is of rigid metallic construction, concentric in shape, and symmetric about its longitudinal axis. It has a mass of 1.91 ±0.05 kg (4.21 ±0.1 lb) and a minimum mass moment of inertia of 140 kg-cm
2 (0.124 lbf-in-sec
2) in yaw and pitch about the CG. One third (
1/3) of the weight of the suspension cables and their attachments to the impact probe may be included in the calculation of mass, and such components may not exceed five percent of the total weight of the test probe. The impacting end of the probe, perpendicular to and concentric with the longitudinal axis, is at least 12.5 mm (0.5 in) long, and has a flat, continuous, and non-deformable 76.2 ±0.2 mm (3.00 ±0.01 in) diameter face with a maximum edge radius of 12.7 mm (0.5 in). The probe's end opposite to the impact face has provisions for mounting an accelerometer with its sensitive axis collinear with the longitudinal axis of the probe. No concentric portions of the impact probe may exceed the diameter of the impact face. The impact probe has a free air resonant frequency of not less than 1000 Hz, which may be determined using the procedure listed in the PADI (incorporated by reference, see § 572.170).
