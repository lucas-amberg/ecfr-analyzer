# ยง 572.182   Head assembly.

(a) The head assembly consists of the head (drawing 175-1000), including the neck upper transducer structural replacement, and a set of three (3) accelerometers in conformance with specifications in ยง 572.189(b) and mounted as shown in drawing (175-0000 sheet 1 of 6). When tested to the test procedure specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the head assembly shall meet performance requirements specified in paragraph (c) of this section.


(b) *Test procedure.* The head shall be tested per procedure specified in 49 CFR ยง 572.112(a).


(c) *Performance criteria.* (1) When the head assembly is dropped in accordance with ยง 572.112 (a), the measured peak resultant acceleration shall be between 125 g's and 155 g's;


(2) The resultant acceleration-time curve shall be unimodal to the extent that oscillations occurring after the main acceleration pulse shall not exceed 15% (zero to peak) of the main pulse;


(3) The fore-and-aft component of the head acceleration shall not exceed 15 g's.
