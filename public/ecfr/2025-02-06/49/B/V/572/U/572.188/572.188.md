# § 572.188   Pelvis.

(a) The pelvis (175-6000) is part of the torso assembly shown in drawing 175-0000. The pelvis is equipped with a pubic symphysis load sensor in conformance with § 572.189(f) and mounted as shown in drawing (175-0000 sheet 4). When subjected to tests procedures specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the pelvis assembly shall meet performance requirements specified in paragraph (c) of this section.


(b) *Test procedure.*

(1) Soak the dummy assembly (175-0000) without suit (175-8000) and shoulder foam pad (175-3010) as specified in § 572.189(n);


(2) The dummy is seated as specified in Figure U6 in appendix A to this subpart;


(3) The pelvis impactor is the same as specified in § 572.189(a);


(4) The impactor is guided, if needed, so that at contact with the pelvis its longitudinal axis is within ±0.5 degrees of a horizontal plane and perpendicular to the midsagittal plane of the dummy and the centerpoint on the impactor's face is within 5 mm of the center of the H-point in the pelvis, as shown in Figure U6 in appendix A to this subpart;


(5) The impactor impacts the dummy's pelvis at 4.3 ±0.1 m/s.


(6) Time zero is defined in § 572.189(k).


(c) *Performance criteria.* (1) The impactor force (probe acceleration multiplied by its mass) shall be not less than 4,700 N and not more than 5,400 N, occurring between 11.8 ms and 16.1 ms from time zero;


(2) The pubic symphysis load, measured with load cell specified in § 572.189(f) shall be not less than 1,230 N and not more than 1,590 N occurring between 12.2 ms and 17.0 ms from time zero.
