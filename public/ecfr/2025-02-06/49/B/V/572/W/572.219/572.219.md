# § 572.219   Test conditions and instrumentation.

All assemblies and drawings referenced in this section are contained in Drawings and Specifications, incorporated by reference, see § 572.210.


(a) The following test equipment and instrumentation is needed for qualification as set forth in this subpart:


(1) The test probe for shoulder, thorax, and pelvis impacts is of rigid metallic construction, concentric in shape, and symmetric about its longitudinal axis. It has a mass of 3.81 ± 0.02 kg and a minimum mass moment of inertia of 560 kg-cm
2 in yaw and pitch about the CG. One-third (
1/3) of the weight of the suspension cables and their attachments to the impact probe is included in the calculation of mass, and such components may not exceed five percent of the total weight of the test probe. The impacting end of the probe, perpendicular to and concentric with the longitudinal axis, is at least 25.4 mm long, and has a flat, continuous, and non-deformable 70.0 ± 0.25 mm diameter face with an edge radius between 6.4-12.7 mm. The probe's end opposite to the impact face has provisions for mounting of an accelerometer with its sensitive axis collinear with the longitudinal axis of the probe. No concentric portions of the impact probe may exceed the diameter of the impact face. The impact probe shall have a free air resonant frequency of not less than 1000 Hz, which may be determined using the procedure listed in the PADI (incorporated by reference, see § 572.210).


(2) Head accelerometers have dimensions, response characteristics, and sensitive mass locations specified in drawing SA572-S4 and are mounted in the head as shown in drawing 020-0100, sheet 2 of 5.


(3) The upper neck force and moment transducer has the dimensions, response characteristics, and sensitive axis locations specified in drawing SA572-S8 and is mounted in the head-neck assembly as shown in drawing 020-0100, sheet 2 of 5.


(4) The angular rate sensors for the fore-aft neck flexion and lateral neck flexion qualification tests have the dimensions and response characteristics specified in drawing SA572-S58 and are mounted in the headform and on the pendulum as shown in figures W3 and W4 in appendix A to this subpart.


(5) The string potentiometer shoulder deflection transducers have the dimensions and response characteristics specified in drawing SA572-S38 or SA572-S39 and are mounted to the torso assembly as shown in drawing 020-0100, sheet 2 of 5.


(6) The IR-TRACC thorax deflection transducers have the dimensions and response characteristics specified in drawing SA572-S37 and are mounted to the torso assembly as shown in drawing 020-0100, sheet 2 of 5.


(7) The lumbar spine force and moment transducer has the dimensions, response characteristics, and sensitive axis locations specified in drawing SA572-S8 and is mounted in the torso assembly as shown in drawing 020-0100, sheet 2 of 5.

(b) The following instrumentation may be required for installation in the dummy for compliance testing. If so, it is installed during qualification procedures as described in this subpart:


(1) The optional angular rate sensors for the head have the dimensions and response characteristics specified in any of drawings SA572-S55, SA572-S56, SA572-S57 or SA572-S58 and are mounted in the head as shown in drawing 020-0100, sheet 2 of 5.


(2) The upper spine accelerometers have the dimensions, response characteristics, and sensitive mass locations specified in drawing SA572-S4 and are mounted in the torso assembly as shown in drawing 020-0100, sheet 2 of 5.


(3) The pelvis accelerometers have the dimensions, response characteristics, and sensitive mass locations specified in drawing SA572-S4 and are mounted in the torso assembly as shown in drawing 020-0100, sheet 2 of 5.


(4) The T1 accelerometer has the dimensions, response characteristics, and sensitive mass location specified in drawing SA572-S4 and is mounted in the torso assembly as shown in drawing 020-0100, sheet 2 of 5.


(5) The lower neck force and moment transducer has the dimensions, response characteristics, and sensitive axis locations specified in drawing SA572-S8 and is mounted to the neck assembly as shown in drawing 020-0100, sheet 2 of 5.


(6) The tilt sensor has the dimensions and response characteristics specified in drawing SA572-S44 and is mounted to the torso assembly as shown in drawing 020-0100, sheet 2 of 5.


(7) The pubic force transducers have the dimensions and response characteristics specified in drawing SA572-S7 and are mounted in the torso assembly as shown in drawing 020-0100, sheet 2 of 5.


(c) The outputs of transducers installed in the dummy and in the test equipment specified by this part are to be recorded in individual data channels that conform to SAE J211 (incorporated by reference, see § 572.210) except as noted, with channel frequency classes (CFCs) as follows:
