(2) The current odometer reading (not to include tenths of miles);


(3) The date of the statement;


(4) The lessee's printed name and current address;


(5) The lessor's printed name and current address;


(6) The identity of the vehicle, including its make, model, year, and body type, and its vehicle identification number;

(c) In addition to the information provided under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section,


(1) The lessee shall certify that to the best of his knowledge the odometer reading reflects the actual mileage; or


(2) If the lessee knows that the odometer reading reflects the amount of mileage in excess of the designed mechanical odometer limit, he shall include a statement to that effect; or

(d) If the lessor transfers the leased vehicle without obtaining possession of it, the lessor may indicate on the title the mileage disclosed by the lessee under paragraph (b) and (c) of this section, unless the lessor has reason to believe that the disclosure by the lessee does not reflect the actual mileage of the vehicle.


(e) Any electronic system maintained by a lessor for the purpose of complying with the requirements of this section shall meet the requirements of ยง 580.4(b) of this part.
