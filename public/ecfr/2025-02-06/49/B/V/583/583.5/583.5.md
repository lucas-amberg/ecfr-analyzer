(f) A final stage manufacturer of vehicles assembled in multiple stages need not provide the U.S./Canadian Parts Content or Major Foreign Sources items of the label otherwise required under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.


(g) A manufacturer that produces a total of fewer than 1000 passenger motor vehicles in a model year need not provide the U.S./Canadian Parts Content or Major Foreign Sources items of the label otherwise required under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
