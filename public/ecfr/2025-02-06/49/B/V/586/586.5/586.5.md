# ยง 586.5   General requirements.

(a) Each manufacturer wishing to register as a replica motor vehicle manufacturer must have a calendar year, worldwide production, including any by a parent or subsidiary of the manufacturer, of not more than 5,000 motor vehicles, and must not be a registered importer under 49 CFR part 592. Only one registration is permitted for manufacturers sharing common ownership. If a manufacturer wishes to manufacture replica motor vehicles and share common ownership with a registered replica motor vehicle manufacturer, it may only do so after the registered replica vehicle manufacturer submits an updated registration submission indicating that the exemption for 325 replica vehicles will be divided between the manufacturers. Replica manufacturers sharing common ownership will be limited to a total of 325 replica vehicles. An update to a registration to add a manufacturer under common ownership shall allocate the exemption for 325 replica vehicles between the manufacturers. An update to the registration to adjust the allocation must be made pursuant to ยง 586.9.


(b) Each manufacturer wishing to manufacture replica motor vehicles under this program must be registered, according to the requirements in ยง 586.6, as a replica motor vehicle manufacturer for the calendar year in which the replica motor vehicle is manufactured.

(1) 49 U.S.C. 30112(a) regarding the Federal motor vehicle safety standards applicable to vehicles (as opposed to standards applicable to motor vehicle equipment) in effect on the date of manufacture of the replica motor vehicle; and


(2) 49 U.S.C. 32304, 32502, 32902 and 15 U.S.C. 1232.


(d) Each replica motor vehicle manufacturer shall:


(1) Meet all the requirements set forth in this part;


(2) Not manufacture more than 325 replica motor vehicles in a calendar year; and,


(3) Meet 49 U.S.C. 30112(a) regarding the Federal motor vehicle safety standards applicable to equipment items installed on the vehicle.


(e) Each replica motor vehicle, as manufactured, shall resemble the original replicated vehicle.


(f) An exemption granted by NHTSA may not be transferred to any other person, and shall expire at the end of the calendar year for which it was granted with respect to any volume authorized by the exemption that was not applied by the replica motor vehicle manufacturer to vehicles built during that calendar year.
