Upon receipt of a registration submitted on vPIC, NHTSA will automatically notify the registrant by email within 90 days of the receipt whether the registration is approved, denied, or incomplete.

(a) NHTSA determines that the registrant does not meet the requirements of this part 586;


(b) The registration is incomplete, and the registrant has failed to provide the missing information within 60 days after being notified by NHTSA pursuant to 586.8; or,


(c) The registration relies on the same facts and circumstances as a previously denied registration.
