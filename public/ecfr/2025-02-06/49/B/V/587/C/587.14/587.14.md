(c) Backing sheet. 


(1) *Dimensions.* The backing sheet has a height of 800 mm (31.5 in), a width of 1,000 mm (39.4 in), and a thickness of 2.0 mm (0.08 in) ±0.1 mm (0.004 in). 


(2) *Material.* The backing sheet is manufactured out of aluminum 5251/5052. 


(d) Cladding sheet. 


(1) *Dimensions.* The cladding sheet of the main honeycomb block has a total length of 1,700 mm (66.9 in), a width of 1,000 mm (39.4 in), and a thickness of 0.81 mm (0.03 in) ±0.07 mm (0.003 in). It is shaped as indicated in Figure 1. 


(2) *Material.* The cladding sheet of the main honeycomb block is manufactured out of aluminum 5251/5052. 


(e) Bumper element honeycomb facing sheet. 


(1) *Dimensions.* The bumper facing sheet has a height of 330 mm (13 in), a width of 1,000 mm (39.4 in), and a thickness of 0.81 mm (0.03 in) ±0.07 mm (0.003 in). 


(2) *Material.* The bumper element honeycomb facing sheet is manufactured out of aluminum 5251/5052.
