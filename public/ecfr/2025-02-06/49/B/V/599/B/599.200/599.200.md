(3) A dealer must register separately, following the process under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, for each make of vehicle it sells, using the authorization code associated with that vehicle make.


(d) *Disposition of registration application.* The agency will review the registration application for compliance with this part, including completeness, and notify the dealer as follows:


(1) For an approved registration:


(i) By e-mail notification to the authorized dealer representative, with a user identification and password that will allow the submission of transactions; and


(ii) By listing the “doing business as” name, physical address, and general telephone number of the dealer on the agency Web site at *http://www.cars.gov.*

(e) *Revocation of Dealer Registration.* (1) *Termination or Discontinuance of Franchise.*

(i) A dealer whose franchise agreement with an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) has expired without renewal, has been terminated, or otherwise is no longer in effect shall be automatically removed as a matter of course, subject to paragraph (e)(1)(iii), from the agency's list of registered dealers and may no longer receive a credit for new transactions under the CARS Program submitted for repayment on or after the date that the franchise expired or no longer is in effect.


(ii) Paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section does not preclude a dealer registered under other franchise agreements from receiving a credit for transactions under those agreements that have not expired or been discontinued.


(iii) A dealer whose name is removed from the agency's list of registered dealers under paragraph (e)(1)(i) shall be reinstated to the list of registered dealers upon a showing to NHTSA of proper and adequate license to sell new vehicles to ultimate purchasers.


(2) *Other suspension or revocations actions.* The agency may also suspend or revoke the registration of a dealer as provided in § 599.504.
