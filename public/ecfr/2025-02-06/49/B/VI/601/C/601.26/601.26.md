# ยง 601.26   Petitions for extension of time to comment.

A petition for extension of the time to submit comments must be received not later than three (3) days before expiration of the time stated in the notice. The filing of the petition does not automatically extend the time for petitioner's comments. Such a petition is granted only if the petitioner shows good cause for the extension, and if the extension is consistent with the public interest. If an extension is granted, it is granted to all persons, and it is published in the _Federal Register._
