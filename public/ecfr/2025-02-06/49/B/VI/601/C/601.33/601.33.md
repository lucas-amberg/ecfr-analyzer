# ยง 601.33   Processing of petitions.

(a) Each petition received under ยง 601.32 of this part is referred to the head of the office responsible for the subject matter of that petition. Unless the Administrator otherwise specifies, no public hearing, argument or other proceeding is held directly on a petition before its disposition under this section.


(b) *Grants.* If the Administrator determines the petition contains adequate justification, he/she initiates rulemaking action under this Subpart C or grants the exemption, as the case may be.


(c) *Denials.* If the Administrator determines the petition does not justify rulemaking or granting the exemption, he/she denies the petition.


(d) *Notification.* Whenever the Administrator determines that a petition should be granted or denied, the office concerned and the Office of Chief Counsel prepare a notice of that grant or denial for issuance to the petitioner, and the Administrator issues it to the petitioner.
