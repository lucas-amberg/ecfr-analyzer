FTA will treat a failure to submit the required report by the due date or the extension date as failure to report data under ยง 630.5.


(b) *Incomplete reports.* FTA will treat an NTD submission that does not contain all of the required data; or does not contain the required certifications, where applicable; or that is not in substantial conformance with the definitions, procedures, and format requirements set out in the reference documents as a failure to report data under ยง 630.5, unless the reporting entity has exhausted all possibilities for obtaining this information.
