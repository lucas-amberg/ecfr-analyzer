# ยง 633.19   Exclusion from the project management oversight program.

The Administrator may, in compelling circumstances, determine that a project meeting the criteria of ยง 633.5(e)(1) is not a major capital project because project management oversight under this part will not benefit the Federal government or the recipient. Typically, this means a project that:


(a) Involves a recipient whose past record indicates the appropriateness of excluding the project from project management oversight under this part; and


(b) Involves such a greater level of financial risk to the recipient than to the Federal government that project management oversight under this part is made less necessary to secure the recipient's diligence.
