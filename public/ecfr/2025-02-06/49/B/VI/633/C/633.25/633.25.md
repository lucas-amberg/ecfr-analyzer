A project management plan must be tailored to the type, costs, complexity, and phase of the major capital project, and to the recipient's management capacity and capability. A project management plan must be written to a level of detail sufficient to enable the recipient to determine whether the necessary staff and processes are in place to control the scope, budget, schedule, and quality of the project, while managing the safety and security of all persons. A project management plan must be developed with a sufficient level of detail to enable the Administrator to assess the adequacy of the recipient's plan. At a minimum, a recipient's project management plan must include:


(a) Adequate recipient staff organization with well-defined reporting relationships, statements of functional responsibilities, job descriptions, and job qualifications;


(b) A budget covering the project management organization, appropriate contractors and consultants, property acquisition, utility relocation, systems demonstration staff, audits, contingencies, and miscellaneous payments as the recipient may be prepared to justify;


(c) A construction schedule for the project;


(d) A document control procedure and recordkeeping system;


(e) A change order procedure that includes a documented, systematic approach to the handling of construction change orders;


(f) A description of organizational structures, management skills, and staffing levels required throughout the construction phase;


(g) Quality control and quality assurance functions, procedures, and responsibilities for project design, procurement, construction, system installation, and integration of system components;


(h) Material testing policies and procedures;


(i) Internal plan implementation and reporting requirements including cost and schedule control procedures;


(j) Criteria and procedures to be used for testing the operational system or its major components;


(k) Periodic updates of the project management plan, especially related to project budget and schedule, financing, ridership estimates, and the status of local efforts to enhance ridership where ridership estimates partly depend on the success of those efforts;


(l) The recipient's commitment to submit a project budget and project schedule to the Administrator quarterly;


(m) Safety and security management; and


(n) Management of risks, contingencies, and insurance.
