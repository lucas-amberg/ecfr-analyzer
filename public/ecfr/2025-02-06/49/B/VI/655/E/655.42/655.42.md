# ยง 655.42   Pre-employment alcohol testing.

An employer may, but is not required to, conduct pre-employment alcohol testing under this part. If an employer chooses to conduct pre-employment alcohol testing, the employer must comply with the following requirements:


(a) The employer must conduct a pre-employment alcohol test before the first performance of safety-sensitive functions by every covered employee (whether a new employee or someone who has transferred to a position involving the performance of safety-sensitive functions).


(b) The employer must treat all covered employees performing safety-sensitive functions the same for the purpose of pre-employment alcohol testing (*i.e.*, you must not test some covered employees and not others).


(c) The employer must conduct the pre-employment tests after making a contingent offer of employment or transfer, subject to the employee passing the pre-employment alcohol test.


(d) The employer must conduct all pre-employment alcohol tests using the alcohol testing procedures set forth in 49 CFR Part 40.


(e) The employer must not allow a covered employee to begin performing safety-sensitive functions unless the result of the employee's test indicates an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02.
