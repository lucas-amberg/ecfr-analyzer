# ยง 663.39   Post-delivery audit review.

(a) If a recipient cannot complete a post-delivery audit because the recipient or its agent cannot certify Buy America compliance or that the rolling stock meets the purchaser's requirements specified in the contract, the rolling stock may be rejected and final acceptance by the recipient will not be required. The recipient may exercise any legal rights it has under the contract or at law.


(b) This provision does not preclude the recipient and manufacturer from agreeing to a conditional acceptance of rolling stock pending manufacturer's correction of deviations within a reasonable period of time.
