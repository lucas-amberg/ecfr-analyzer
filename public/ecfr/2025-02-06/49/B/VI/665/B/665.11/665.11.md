# § 665.11   Testing requirements.

(a) In order to be tested at the Bus Testing Facility, a new model bus shall—


(1) Be a single model that complies with NHTSA requirements at 49 CFR part 565 *Vehicle Identification Number Requirements;* 49 CFR part 566 *Manufacturer Identification;* 49 CFR part 567 *Certification;* and where applicable, 49 CFR part 568 *Vehicle Manufactured in Two or More Stages—All Incomplete, Intermediate and Final-Stage Manufacturers of Vehicle Manufactured in Two or More Stages;*

(2) Have been produced by an entity whose Disadvantaged Business Enterprise DBE goals have been submitted to FTA pursuant to 49 CFR part 26;


(3) Identify the maximum rated quantity of standee passengers on the interior bulkhead in 2 inch tall or greater characters;


(4) Meet all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, as defined by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in part 571 of this title; and


(5) Be substantially fabricated and assembled using the techniques, tooling, and materials that will be used in production of subsequent buses of that model with the manufacturing point of origin for the bus structure, the axles, the foundation brakes, the propulsion power system and auxiliary power systems (engine, transmission, traction batteries, electric motor(s), fuel cell(s)), and the primary energy storage and delivery systems (fuel tanks, fuel injectors & manifolds, and the fuel injection electronic control unit) identified in the test request submitted to FTA during the scheduling process.


(b) If the new bus model has not previously been tested at the Bus Testing Facility, then the new bus model shall undergo the full tests requirements for Maintainability, Reliability, Safety, Performance (including Braking Performance), Structural Integrity, Fuel Economy, Noise, and Emissions Tests.


(c) If the new bus model has not previously been tested at the Bus Testing Facility and is being produced on a third-party chassis that has been previously tested on another bus model at the Bus Testing Facility, then the new bus model may undergo partial testing in place of full testing.


(d) If the new bus model has previously been tested at the Bus Testing Facility, but is subsequently manufactured with a major change in chassis or components, then the new bus model may undergo partial testing in place of full testing.


(e) Buses shall be tested according to the service life requirements identified in the prevailing published version of FTA Circular 5010.


(f) Tests performed in a higher service life category (*i.e.,* longer service life) need not be repeated when the same bus model is used in lesser service life applications.
