(1) A discussion of the nature of the work to be performed and the characteristics of the work, including work plans for multiple roadway worker groups within a single work area;


(2) Working limits;


(3) The hazards involved in performing the work. For RTAs with electrified systems, this discussion must include the status of power and hazards explicitly related to the electrified system;


(4) Information on how on-track safety is to be provided for each track identified to be fouled; identification and location of key personnel, such as a watchperson and the roadway worker in charge; and information on what should be done in the event of an emergency;


(5) Instructions for each on-track safety procedure to be followed, including appropriate flags and proper flag placement;


(6) Communication roles and responsibilities for all transit workers involved in the work;

(9) Required personal protective equipment;


(10) Designated place(s) of safety of a sufficient size to accommodate all roadway workers within the work area; and

(c) *Confirmation and written acknowledgement.* A job safety briefing is complete only after:


(1) The roadway worker in charge confirms that each roadway worker understands the on-track safety procedures and instructions;


(2) Each roadway worker acknowledges in writing the briefing and the requirement to use the required personal protective equipment; and


(3) The roadway worker in charge confirms in writing that they have received written acknowledgement of the briefing from each worker.
