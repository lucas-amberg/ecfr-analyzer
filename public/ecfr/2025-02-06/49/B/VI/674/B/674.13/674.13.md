(a) Every State that must establish a State Safety Oversight program in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 5329 must also establish an SSOA for the purpose of overseeing the safety of rail fixed guideway public transportation systems within that State. Further, the State must ensure that:


(1) The SSOA is financially and legally independent from any public transportation agency the SSOA is obliged to oversee;


(2) The SSOA does not directly provide public transportation services in an area with a rail fixed guideway public transportation system the SSOA is obliged to oversee;


(3) The SSOA does not employ any individual who is also responsible for administering a rail fixed guideway public transportation system the SSOA is obliged to oversee;


(4) The SSOA has authority to review, approve, oversee, and enforce the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan for a rail fixed guideway public transportation system required by 49 U.S.C. 5329(d) and part 673 of this chapter;


(5) The SSOA has investigative, inspection, and enforcement authority with respect to the safety of all rail fixed guideway public transportation systems within the State;


(6) At least once every three years, the SSOA audits every rail fixed guideway public transportation system's compliance with the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan required by 49 U.S.C. 5329(d) and part 673 of this chapter; and


(7) At least once a year, the SSOA reports the status of the safety of each rail fixed guideway public transportation system to the Governor, the FTA, and the board of directors, or equivalent entity, of the rail fixed guideway public transportation system.


(b) At the request of the Governor of a State, the Administrator may waive the requirements for financial and legal independence and the prohibitions on employee conflicts of interest under paragraphs (a)(1) and (3) of this section, if the rail fixed guideway public transportation systems in design, construction, or revenue operations in the State have fewer than one million combined actual and projected rail fixed guideway revenue miles per year or provide fewer than ten million combined actual and projected unlinked passenger trips per year. However:


(1) If a State shares jurisdiction over one or more rail fixed guideway public transportation systems with another State, and has one or more rail fixed guideway public transportation systems that are not shared with another State, the revenue miles and unlinked passenger trips of the rail fixed guideway public transportation system under shared jurisdiction will not be counted in the Administrator's decision whether to issue a waiver.


(2) The Administrator will rescind a waiver issued under this subsection if the number of revenue miles per year or unlinked passenger trips per year increases beyond the thresholds specified in this subsection.
