# ยง 674.31   Triennial audits: general requirements.

At least once every three years, an SSOA must conduct a complete audit of an RTA's compliance with its Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan. Alternatively, an SSOA may conduct the audit on an on-going basis over the three-year timeframe. If an SSOA audits an RTA's compliance on an ongoing basis, the SSOA shall issue interim audit reports at least annually. At the conclusion of the three-year audit cycle, the SSOA shall issue a report with findings and recommendations arising from the triennial or ongoing audit, which must include, at minimum, an analysis of the effectiveness of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan, recommendations for improvements, and a corrective action plan, if necessary or appropriate. The RTA must be given an opportunity to comment on the findings and recommendations.
