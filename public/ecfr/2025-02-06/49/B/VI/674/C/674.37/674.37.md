# ยง 674.37   Corrective action plans.

(a) The SSOA must, at a minimum, require the development of a CAP for the following:


(1) Results from investigations, in which the RTA or SSOA determined that causal or contributing factors require corrective action;


(2) Findings of non-compliance from safety reviews and inspections performed by the SSOA; or


(3) Findings of non-compliance from internal safety reviews performed by the RTA.


(b) In any instance in which an RTA must develop and carry out a CAP, the SSOA must review and approve the CAP before the RTA carries out the plan. However, an exception may be made for immediate or emergency corrective actions that must be taken to ensure immediate safety, provided that the SSOA has been given timely notification, and the SSOA provides subsequent review and approval.


(c) A CAP must describe, specifically, the actions the RTA will take to correct the deficiency identified by the CAP, the schedule for taking those actions, and the individuals responsible for taking those actions. The RTA must periodically report to the SSOA on its progress in carrying out the CAP. The SSOA may monitor the RTA's progress in carrying out the CAP through unannounced, on-site inspections, or any other means the SSOA deems necessary or appropriate.


(d) In any instance in which a safety event on the RTA's rail fixed guideway public transportation system is the subject of an investigation by the NTSB or FTA, the SSOA must evaluate whether the findings or recommendations by the NTSB or FTA require a CAP by the RTA, and if so, the SSOA must order the RTA to develop and carry out a CAP.
