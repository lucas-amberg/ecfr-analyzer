# § 802.14   Review procedure and judicial review.

(a) A requester may appeal from any adverse determination within 30 days after actual receipt of a denial from the System Manager. The appeal must be in writing addressed to the Chairman, National Transportation Safety Board, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20594, and shall contain a statement on the envelope and in the appeal: “Appeal from Privacy Act Adverse Determination.”


(b) The Board shall make a determination with respect to the appeal within 30 working days after the actual receipt of the appeal by the Chairman, except as provided for in “unusual circumstances” infra.


(c)(1) *Review of denial of access.* If the appeal upholds the denial of access to records, the Board shall: Notify the requester in writing, explaining the Board's determination; state that the denial is a final agency action and that judicial review is available in a district court of the United States in the district where the requester resides or has his principal place of business, or where the agency records are located, or in the District of Columbia; and request a filing with the Board of a concise statement enumerating the reasons for the requester's disagreement with the denial, pursuant to subsection (g) of the Act.


(2) *Review of denial of correction or amendment.* If the appeal upholds the denial in whole or in part for correction or amendment of the record, the same notification and judicial review privileges described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall apply.


(d) If the denial is reversed on appeal, the Board shall notify the requester in writing of the reversal. The notice shall include a brief statement outlining those portions of the individual's record which were not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete, and corrections of the record which were made, and shall provide the individual with a courtesy copy of the corrected record.


(e) Copies of all appeals and written determinations will be furnished by the System Manager to the Board.


(f) In unusual circumstances, time limits may be extended by not more than 10 working days by written notice to the individual making the request. The notice shall include the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be forthcoming. “Unusual circumstances” as used in this section shall include circumstances where a search and collection of the requested records from field offices or other establishments are required, cases where a voluminous amount of data is involved, and cases where consultations are required with other agencies or with others having a substantial interest in the determination of the request.


(g) *Statements of Disagreement.* (1) Written Statements of Disagreement may be furnished by the individual within 30 working days of the date of actual receipt of the final adverse determination of the Board.

(3) The Director, Bureau of Administration, or his designee, may, if he deems it appropriate, prepare a concise Statement of Explanation indicating why the requested amendments or corrections were not made. Such Statement of Explanation shall be included in the system of records in the same manner as the Statement of Disagreement. Courtesy copies of the NTSB Statement of Explanation and the notation of dispute, as marked on the original record, shall be furnished to the individual who requested correction or amendment of the record.


(h) *Notices of correction and/or amendment, or dispute.* After a record has been corrected or a Statement of Disagreement has been filed, the Director, Bureau of Administration, or his designee, shall within 30 working days thereof, advise all previous recipients of the affected record as to the correction or the filing of the Statement of Disagreement. The identity of such recipients shall be determined pursuant to an accounting of disclosures required by the Act or any other accounting previously made. Any disclosure of disputed information occurring after a Statement of Disagreement has been filed shall clearly identify the specific information disputed and shall be accompanied by a copy of the Statement of Disagreement and a copy of any NTSB Statement of Explanation.


(i) *Disclosure to others of records concerning individuals.* Neither the Board nor other NTSB personnel shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records maintained by NTSB, by any means of communication, including oral communication, to any person, or to another Government agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent, of the individual to whom the record pertains, unless disclosure of the record is:
