# § 803.1   Description.

The official seal of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is described as follows: An American bald eagle with wings displayed, holding an olive branch in its right talon and a bundle of 13 arrows in its left talon. Above the eagle's head is a white scroll inscribed “E Pluribus Unum” in black. The eagle bears a shield that resembles the United States flag with vertical stripes of alternating white and red and a blue top; all are within an encircling inscription, “National Transportation Safety Board”. The eagle's wings, body, and upper portion of the legs are shades of brown. The head, neck, and tail are white. The beak, lower portion of the legs, feet, arrows, olive branch, and encircling inscription are gold. When the full color seal is illustrated on print or digital media, the background of the seal must be white. When the full color seal is embroidered on official NTSB uniform items, the seal's background must be the color of the material. When the monochrome seal is used on print or digital media, the seal can be displayed in black, blue, or in white on contrasting background. When used on official NTSB uniform items, the monochrome seal can be illustrated in yellow-gold on navy blue material. The monochrome version of the NTSB's official seal appears in Figure 1.
