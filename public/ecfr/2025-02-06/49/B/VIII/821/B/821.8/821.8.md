# § 821.8   Service of documents.

(a) *Who must be served.* (1) Copies of all documents filed with the Board must be simultaneously served on (*i.e.,* sent to) all other parties to the proceeding, on the date of filing, by the person filing them. A certificate of service shall be a part of each document and any copy or copies thereof tendered for filing, and shall certify concurrent service on the Board and the parties. A certificate of service shall be in substantially the following form:


(2) Service shall be made on the person designated in accordance with § 821.7(f) to receive service. If no such person has been designated, service shall be made directly on the party.


(b) *Method of Service.* (1) Service of documents by any party on any other party shall be accomplished by any method prescribed in § 821.7(a)(3) for the filing of documents with the Board. A party may waive the applicability of this paragraph, and elect to be served with documents by the other parties to the proceeding solely by electronic mail, by filing a written document with the Board (with copies to the other parties) expressly stating such a preference.


(2) Notices of hearing, written initial decisions, law judges' appealable orders and Board orders on appeal shall be served by the Board on parties other than the Administrator by certified mail. Such documents may be served on the Administrator by first-class mail or facsimile. The Board may serve all other documents on the parties by first-class mail or facsimile. 


(c) *Where service shall be made.* Except for electronic mail, personal service, parties shall be served at the address appearing in the official record, which the Board must receive under §§ 821.6(d) and 821.7(f). In the case of an agent designated by an air carrier under 49 U.S.C. 46103, service may be accomplished only at the agent's office or usual place of residence.


(d) *Presumption of service.* There shall be a presumption of lawful service:


(1) When receipt has been acknowledged by a person who customarily or in the ordinary course of business receives mail at the residence or principal place of business of the party or of the person designated under § 821.7(f);


(2) When a properly addressed envelope, sent to the most current address in the official record, by regular, registered or certified mail, has been returned as unclaimed or refused; or


(3) When a document is transmitted by facsimile or electronic mail and there is evidence to confirm its successful transmission to the intended recipient.


(e) *Date of service.* The date of service shall be determined in the same manner as the filing date is determined under § 821.7(a)(4).
