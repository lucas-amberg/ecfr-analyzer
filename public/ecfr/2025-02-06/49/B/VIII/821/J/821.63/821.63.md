# ยง 821.63   Requirement to show cause and imposition of sanction.

(a) Upon receipt of a communication made or knowingly caused to be made by a party in violation of ยง 821.61, the presiding law judge (or the chief law judge, if the proceeding has not been assigned to a law judge) or the Board may, to the extent consistent with the interests of justice and the policy of the underlying statutes it administers, require the party to show cause why its claim or interest in the proceeding should not be dismissed, denied, disregarded or otherwise adversely affected on account of such violation. 


(b) The Board may, to the extent consistent with the interest of justice and the policy of the underlying statutes it administers, consider a violation of ยง 821.61 sufficient grounds for a decision adverse to a party who has knowingly committed or knowingly caused such a violation to occur. Alternatively, the Board may impose a sanction on the party's attorney or representative, including suspending or barring the attorney or representative from practicing before it, where such action would be appropriate and penalizing the party represented would not be in the interest of justice.
