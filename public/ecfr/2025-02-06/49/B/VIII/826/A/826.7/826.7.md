# ยง 826.7   Rulemaking on maximum rates for attorney fees.

(a) In addition to increases based on cost of living (*see* ยง 826.6), attorney fees in some or all of the proceedings covered by this part may also be increased beyond the statutory cap of $75 if warranted by special factors (such as limited availability of attorneys qualified to handle certain types of proceedings). The Board will conduct any rulemaking proceedings for this purpose under the informal rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act.


(b) Any person may file with the Board a petition for rulemaking to increase the maximum rate for attorney fees by demonstrating that a special factor(s) justifies a higher fee. The petition shall identify the rate the petitioner believes the Board should establish and the proceeding(s) or types of proceedings in which the rate should be used. It should also explain fully the reasons why the higher rate is warranted. The Board will respond to the petition within 60 days after it is filed, by initiating a rulemaking proceeding, denying the petition, or taking other appropriate action.
