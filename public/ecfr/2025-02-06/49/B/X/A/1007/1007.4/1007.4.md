# ยง 1007.4   Procedures for identifying the individual making the request.

When a request for information or for access to records has been made pursuant to ยง 1007.3, before information is given or access is granted pursuant to ยง 1007.5 of these rules, the Board shall require reasonable identification of the person making the request to insure that information is given and records are disclosed only to the proper person. 


(a) An individual may establish his identity by: 


(1) Submitting with his written request for information or for access to photocopy, two pieces of identification bearing his or her name and signature, one of which shall bear his or her current home or business address; or 


(2) Appearing at any office of the Board during the regular working hours for that office and presenting either: 


(i) One piece of identification containing a photograph and signature, such as a driver's license or passport, or, in the case of a Board employee, his or her STB identification card; or 


(ii) Two pieces of identification bearing the individual's name and signature, one of which shows the individual's current home or business address; and 


(3) Providing such other proof of identity as the Board deems satisfactory in the circumstances of a particular request. 


(b) Nothing in this section shall preclude the Board from requiring additional identification before granting access to the records if there is reason to believe that the person making the request may not be the individual to whom the record pertains, or where the sensitivity of the data may warrant. 


(c) The requirements of this subsection shall not apply if the records involved would be available to any person under the Freedom of Information Act.
