# ยง 1013.3   Review and reporting requirements for regulated carriers.

(a) Any carrier choosing to utilize a voting trust may voluntarily submit a copy of the voting trust to the Board for review. The Board's staff will give an informal, nonbinding opinion as to whether the voting trust effectively insulates the settlor from any violation of Board policy against unauthorized acquisition of control of a regulated carrier. 


(b) Any person who establishes an independent trust for the receipt of the voting stock of carrier must file a copy of the trust, along with any auxiliary or modifying documents, with the Board. 


(c) Any carrier required to file a Schedule 13D with the Securities and Exchange Commission (17 CFR 240.13d-1) which reports the purchase of 5 percent or more of the registered securities of another Board regulated carrier (or the listed shares of a company controlling 10 percent or more of the stock of a Board regulated carrier), must simultaneously file a copy of that schedule with the Board, along with any supplements to that schedule.


(d) Failure to comply with the reporting requirements in paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section will result in denial of the application in which acquisition of control, through the acquisition of the voting stock of another carrier, is sought, unless the applicant shows, by clear and convincing evidence, and the Board finds, that the failure to comply was unintentional and that denial of the application will substantially and adversely affect the public interest and the national transportation policy.
