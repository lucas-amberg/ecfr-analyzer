# § 1016.101   Purpose of these rules.

The Equal Access to Justice Act (5 U.S.C. 504) (called the “Act” in this part), provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain administrative proceedings (called “adversary adjudications”) before the Surface Transportation Board. An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over the Board or another agency of the United States participating in the Board proceeding, unless the Board's position in the proceeding, or that of the other agency, was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in this part describe the parties eligible for awards and the proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, and the procedures and standards that the Board will use to make them.
