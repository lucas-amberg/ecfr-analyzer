(a) *Administrative offset* means withholding money payable by the United States to, or held by the Government for, a person to satisfy a debt the person owes the Government. 


(b) *Claim* and *debt* are used synonymously and interchangeably for purposes of this part. These terms refer to an amount of money or property which has been determined by an appropriate agency official to be owed to the United States by any person, organization, or entity except another Federal agency.


(c) *Delinquent.* A debt is considered delinquent if it has not been paid by the date specified in the initial written demand for payment or applicable contractual agreement with the Board, unless other satisfactory payment arrangements have been made by that date. If the debtor fails to satisfy an obligation under a payment agreement with the Board after other payment arrangements have been made, the debt becomes a delinquent debt. 


(d) *Payment in full* means payment of the total debt due the United States, including any interest, penalty, and administrative costs of collection assessed against the debtor.
