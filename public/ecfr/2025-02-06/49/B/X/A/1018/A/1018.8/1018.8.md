# ยง 1018.8   Subdivision of claims.

The Board shall consider a debtor's liability arising from a particular transaction or contract as a single claim in determining whether the claim is less than the monetary limitation for the purpose of compromising, suspending, or terminating action. A claim may not be subdivided to avoid the monetary limitation established by 31 U.S.C. 3711(a)(2) and ยง 1018.5 of this part.
