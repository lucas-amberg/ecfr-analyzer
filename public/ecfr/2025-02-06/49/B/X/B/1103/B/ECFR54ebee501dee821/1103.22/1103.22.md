# ยง 1103.22   Restraining clients from improprieties.

A practitioner should see that his clients act with the same restraint that the practitioner himself uses, particularly with reference to the client's conduct toward the Board, fellow practitioners, witnesses and other litigants. If a client persists in improper conduct, the practitioner should terminate their relationship.
