# § 1104.14   Protective orders to maintain confidentiality.

(a) *Segregation of confidential material.* A party submitting materials which it believes are entitled to be kept confidential and not made part of the public docket should submit these materials as a separate package, clearly marked on the outside “Confidential materials subject to a request for a protective order.” When confidential documents are filed, redacted versions must also be filed.


(b) *Requests for protective orders.* A request that materials submitted to the Board be kept confidential should be submitted as a separate pleading and clearly headed “Motion for protective order.”


(c) *Requests for protective orders in stand-alone cost and simplified standards cases.* A motion for protective order in stand-alone cost and simplified standards cases shall specify that evidentiary submissions will designate confidential material within single braces (*i.e.,* {X}), highly confidential material within double braces (*i.e.,* {{Y}}), and sensitive security information within triple braces (*i.e.,* {{{Z}}}). In stand-alone cost cases, the motion for protective order shall be filed together with the notice pursuant to 49 CFR 1111.1.
