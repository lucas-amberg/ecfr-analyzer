# § 1105.5   Determinative criteria.

(a) In determining whether a “major Federal action” (as that term is defined by the Council on Environmental Quality in 40 CFR 1508.18) has the potential to affect significantly the quality of the human environment, the Board is guided by the definition of “significantly” at 40 CFR 1508.27. 


(b) A finding that a service or transaction is not within the STB's jurisdiction does not require an environmental analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act or historic review under the National Historic Preservation Act. 


(c) The environmental laws are not triggered where the STB's action is nothing more than a ministerial act, as in: 


(1) The processing of abandonments proposed under the Northeast Rail Services Act (45 U.S.C. 744(b)(3)); 


(2) Statutorily-authorized interim trail use arrangements under 16 U.S.C. 1247(d) [*see,* 49 CFR 1152.29]; or 


(3) Financial assistance arrangements under 49 U.S.C. 10904 (*see* 49 CFR 1152.27).
