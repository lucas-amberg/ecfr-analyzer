# ยง 1108.32   Assessment of the Small Rate Case Arbitration Program.

The Board will conduct an assessment of the Small Rate Case Arbitration Program to determine if the program is providing an effective means of resolving rate disputes for small cases. The Board's assessment will occur upon the completion of a reasonable number of arbitration proceedings such that the Board can conduct a comprehensive assessment, though not later than three years after start of the program. In conducting this assessment, the Board will obtain feedback from relevant parties. As part of the Board's assessment, it will study the cost to arbitrate a rate dispute as compared to the cost of adjudicating a formal rate case. Depending on the outcome of such review, the Board may determine that the arbitration program will be terminated, modified, and/or extended beyond the initial 5-year period.
