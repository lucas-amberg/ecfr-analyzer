# § 1108.33   Exemption from Final Offer Rate Review.

Carriers that opt into the arbitration program under § 1108.23(a) will be exempt from having their rates challenged under Final Offer Rate Review if the program becomes operative. The exemption from Final Offer Rate Review will become operative upon publication of the Board's notice commencing the arbitration program required under § 1108.22(b) in the _Federal Register._ The exemption will terminate upon the effective date of the participating carrier no longer participating in the arbitration program under this part, including, due to withdrawal from the arbitration program, as set forth in § 1108.23(c) or termination of the program under the sunset-provision of § 1108.22(b). Upon termination of the exemption, parties are permitted to challenge a carrier's rate using Final Offer Rate Review.
