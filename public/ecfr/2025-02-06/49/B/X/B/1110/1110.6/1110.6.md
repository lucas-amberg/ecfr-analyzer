# ยง 1110.6   Petitions for extension of time to comment.

(a) Any person may petition the Board for an extension of time to submit comments in response to a notice of proposed rulemaking. The petition must be submitted at least 10 days prior to the deadline for filing comments. The filing of the petition does not automatically extend the time for the filing of petitioner's comments.


(b) The Board will grant the petition only if the petitioner shows a substantive interest in the proposed rule and good cause for the extension, and if the extension is in the public interest. If an extension is granted, notice of it will be published in the _Federal Register,_ and it will apply to all persons.
