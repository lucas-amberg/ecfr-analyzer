# ยง 1111.2   Content of formal complaints; joinder.

(a) *General.* A formal complaint must contain the correct, unabbreviated names and addresses of each complainant and defendant. It should set forth briefly and in plain language the facts upon which it is based. It should include specific reference to pertinent statutory provisions and Board regulations, and should advise the Board and the defendant fully in what respects these provisions or regulations have been violated. The complaint should contain a detailed statement of the relief requested. Relief in the alternative or of several different types may be demanded, but the issues raised in the formal complaint should not be broader than those to which complainant's evidence is to be directed. In a complaint challenging the reasonableness of a rail rate, the complainant should indicate whether, in its view, the reasonableness of the rate should be examined using constrained market pricing or using the simplified standards adopted pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 10701(d)(3). If the complainant seeks to use the simplified standards, it should support this request by submitting, at a minimum, the following information:


(1) The carrier or region identifier.


(2) The type of shipment (local, received-terminated, etc.).


(3) The one-way distance of the shipment.


(4) The type of car (by URCS code).


(5) The number of cars.


(6) The car ownership (private or railroad).


(7) The commodity type (STCC code).


(8) The weight of the shipment (in tons per car).


(9) The type of movement (individual, multi-car, or unit train).


(10) A narrative addressing whether there is any feasible transportation alternative for the challenged movements.


(11) For matters for which voluntary, binding arbitration is available pursuant to 49 CFR part 1108, the complaint shall state that arbitration was considered, but rejected, as a means of resolving the dispute.


(b) *Disclosure with simplified standards complaint.* The complainant must provide to the defendant all documents relied upon in formulating its assessment of a feasible transportation alternative and all documents relied upon to determine the inputs to the URCS Phase III program.


(c) *Multiple causes of action.* Two or more grounds of complaint concerning the same principle, subject, or statement of facts may be included in one complaint, but should be stated and numbered separately.


(d) *Joinder.* Two or more complainants may join in one complaint against one or more defendants if their respective causes of action concern substantially the same alleged violations and like facts.


(e) *Request for access to waybill data.* Parties needing access to the Waybill Sample to prepare their case should follow the procedures set forth at 49 CFR 1244.9.


(f) *Discovery in stand-alone cost cases.* Upon filing its complaint, the complainant shall certify that it has served its initial discovery requests on the defendant.
