# § 1112.2   Decisions directing modified procedure.

A decision directing that modified procedure be used will set out the schedule for filing verified statements by all parties and will list the names and addresses of all persons who at that time are on the service list in the proceeding. In this part, a statement responding to an opening statement is referred to as a “reply”, and a statement responding to a reply is referred to as a “rebuttal”. Replies to rebuttal material are not permitted. The filing of motions or other pleadings will not automatically stay or delay the established procedural schedule. Parties will adhere to this schedule unless the Board issues an order modifying the schedule.
