# ยง 1113.19   Pleadings: part of the record.

Matters of fact that are verified and filed prior to oral hearing and that are not specifically denied constitute evidence and are part of the record. A witness, who would present such evidence, must be made available for cross-examination if a request is reasonably made. This rule does not apply to protests against tariffs or schedules.
