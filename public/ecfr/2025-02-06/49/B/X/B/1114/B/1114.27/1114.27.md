# ยง 1114.27   Request for admission.

(a) *Availability; procedures for use.* Subject to the provisions of ยง 1114.21(a), a party may serve upon any other party a written request for the admission, for purposes of the pending proceeding only, of the truth of any matters within the scope of ยง 1114.21 set forth in the request, including the genuineness of any documents described in the request for admission. Copies of documents should be served with the request unless they have been or are otherwise furnished or made available for inspection and copying. Each matter of which an admission is requested should be separately set forth. The matter is admitted unless, within a period designated in the request, not less than 15 days after service thereof, the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the party requesting the admission a written answer or objection addressed to the matter, signed by the party or his representative or counsel. If objection is made, the reasons therefor should be stated. The answer should specifically deny the matter or set forth in detail the reasons why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny the matter. A denial should fairly meet the substance of the requested admission, and when good faith requires that a party qualify his answer or deny only a part of the matter of which an admission is requested, he shall specify so much of it as is true and qualify or deny the remainder. An answering party may not give lack of information or knowledge as a reason for failure to admit or deny unless he states that he has made reasonable inquiry and that the information known or readily obtainable by him is insufficient to enable him to admit or deny. A party who considers that a matter of which an admission has been requested presents a genuine issue for hearing may not, on that ground alone, object to the request; he may, subject to the provisions of ยง 1114.31, deny the matter or set forth reasons why he cannot admit or deny it. 


(b) *Effect of admission.* Any matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless upon petition and a showing of good cause the Board enters an order permitting withdrawal or amendment of the admission. Any admission made by a party under this rule is for the purpose of the pending proceeding only and is not an admission by him for any other purpose nor may it be used against him in any other proceeding.


(c) *Service of written requests for admission in those proceedings not requiring a petition.* No requests for admission should be served within 20 days prior to the date assigned for commencement of hearing or the filing of opening statements of fact and argument under the modified procedure, and when requests for admission are to be served in a foreign country they should not be served within 40 days prior to such date.
