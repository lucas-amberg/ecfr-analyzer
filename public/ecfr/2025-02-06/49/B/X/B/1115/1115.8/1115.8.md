# § 1115.8   Petitions to review arbitration decisions.

An appeal of right to the Board is permitted. The appeal must be filed within 20 days upon the Board of a final arbitration decision, unless a later date is authorized by the Board, and is subject to the page limitations of § 1115.2(d). For arbitrations authorized under part 1108, subparts A and B, of this chapter, the Board's standard of review of arbitration decisions will be narrow, and relief will only be granted on grounds that the decision is inconsistent with sound principles of rail regulation economics, a clear abuse of arbitral authority or discretion occurred, the decision directly contravenes statutory authority, or the award limitation was violated.

 For labor arbitration decisions, the Board's standard of review is set forth in *Chicago and North Western Transportation Company—Abandonment—near Dubuque & Oelwein, Iowa,* 3 I.C.C.2d 729 (1987), *aff'd sub nom. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers* v. *Interstate Commerce Commission,* 862 F.2d 330 (D.C. Cir. 1988). The timely filing of a petition will not automatically stay the effect of the arbitration decision. A stay may be requested under § 1115.3(f).
