# ยง 1130.1   When no damages sought.

(a) *Form and content.* Informal complaint may be by letter or other writing filed with the Board and will be serially numbered as filed. The complaint must contain the essential elements of a formal complaint as specified at 49 CFR 1111.2 and may embrace supporting papers.


(b) *Correspondence handling.* When an informal complaint appears susceptible of informal adjustment, the Board will send a copy or statement of the complaint to each subject of the complaint in an attempt to have it satisfied by correspondence, thereby avoiding the filing of a formal complaint. 


(c) *Discontinuance of informal proceeding.* The filing of an informal complaint does not preclude complainant from filing a formal complaint. If a formal complaint is filed, the informal proceeding will be discontinued.
