# § 1150.21   Scope of rules.

These special rules apply to operations over abandoned rail lines, which have been acquired (through purchase or lease) by a State. The rail line must have been fully abandoned, or approved for abandonment by the Board or a bankruptcy court. As used in these rules, the term “State” includes States, political subdivisions of States, and all instrumentalities through which the State can act. An operator has the option of applying for a modified certificate of public convenience and necessity under this subpart or a common carrier certificate under Subpart A of this part. A copy of the modified certificate shall be served on the Association of American Railroads.
