# ยง 1150.31   Scope of exemption.

(a) Except as indicated below, this exemption applies to all acquisitions and operations under section 10901 (*See* 1150.1, *supra*). This exemption also includes:


(1) Acquisition by a noncarrier of rail property that would be operated by a third party;


(2) Operation by a new carrier of rail property acquired by a third party;


(3) A change in operators on the line; and


(4) Acquisition of incidental trackage rights. Incidental trackage rights include the grant of trackage rights by the seller, or the assignment of trackage rights to operate over the line of a third party that occur at the time of the exempt acquisition or operation. This exemption does not apply when a class I railroad abandons a line and another class I railroad then acquires the line in a proposal that would result in a major market extension as defined at ยง 1180.3(c).


(b) Other exemptions that may be relevant to a proposal under this subpart are the exemption for control at ยง 1180.2(d)(1) and (2), and the exemption from securities regulation at 49 CFR part 1177.
