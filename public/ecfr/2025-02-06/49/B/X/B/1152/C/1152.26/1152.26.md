# ยง 1152.26   Board determination under 49 U.S.C. 10903.

(a) The following schedule shall govern the process for Board consideration and decisions in abandonment and discontinuance application proceedings from the time the application is filed until the time of the Board's decision on the merits: 


(b) If an application for abandonment or discontinuance is filed by a bankrupt railroad, the Board shall base its decision (Report to the Bankruptcy Court) on the application and any responses to the application that are filed. In each such instance, the Board shall establish a reasonable period of time for filing responses to the application so that public input can be included in the Board's decision (Report) and so that the Board will be able to meet a deadline imposed or requested by the Bankruptcy Court. Because Board action on abandonment applications by bankrupt railroads is advisory only, no environmental filings or analysis is necessary. See 49 CFR 1105.5(c).
