# ยง 1155.12   Participation in petition proceedings.

(a) An interested person may file a reply to the petition challenging any of the information contained in the petition that is required by 49 CFR 1155.10(c) through (e) and may offer evidence to support its contention. The petitioner will have an opportunity to file a rebuttal.


(b) A facility can acknowledge that it was a solid waste rail transfer facility on October 16, 2008, but no longer operates as such and therefore is not required to seek a land-use-exemption permit. To do so, a facility must file with the Board a certification stating that it:


(1) No longer operates as a solid waste transfer facility;


(2) Understands that by certifying that it no longer operates as a solid waste transfer facility, it no longer qualifies as a facility in existence on October 16, 2008 for purposes of the Clean Railroad Act and these regulations; and


(3) Understands that if it seeks a land-use-exemption permit in the future, it would be required to do so as a proposed facility.


(c) *Filing and service of replies.* (1) Any reply shall be filed with the Board (the Chief, Section of Administration, Office of Proceedings, Surface Transportation Board, 395 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20423) within 20 days of the filing with the Board of the petition.


(2) A copy of the reply shall be served on petitioner or its representative at the time of filing with the Board. Each filing shall contain a certificate of service.


(3) Any rebuttal to a reply shall be filed and served by petitioner no later than 30 days after the filing of the petition.
