# ยง 1155.24   Environmental review.

(a) A land-use-exemption permit generally will require the preparation of an EIS. OEA may reclassify the environmental review requirements of land-use-exemption proceedings on a case-by-case basis, pursuant to 49 CFR 1105.6(d).


(b) An applicant for a land-use-exemption permit must submit an Environmental Report, at least 45 days prior to filing a land-use-exemption-permit application, containing the information described at 49 CFR 1105.7 to the extent applicable to solid waste rail transfer facilities. Applicants shall concurrently file a Historic Report containing the information at 49 CFR 1105.8 if applicable. The Environmental Report must also contain a discussion of the five factors for consideration listed at 49 U.S.C. 10909(d)(1) through (5) and address any associated environmental impacts as they relate to the facility for which a land-use-exemption permit is sought.


(c) The Board strongly encourages applicants to use third-party contractors to assist OEA in preparing the appropriate environmental documentation in land-use-exemption-permit proceedings. *See* 49 CFR 1105.10(d). The environmental reporting requirements outlined above that would otherwise apply are waived if an applicant hires a third-party contractor, OEA approves the scope of the contractor's work, and the contractor works under OEA's direct supervision. *See* 49 CFR 1105.10(d). If an applicant does not hire an independent third-party contractor, the Board may hire a third-party contractor and charge the costs for the contractor to the applicant. *See* 49 U.S.C. 10909(h).


(d) The Board's procedures set forth in 49 CFR 1105.10 for implementation of environmental laws are controlling unless superseded by provisions in this Part.


(e) An applicant for a land-use-exemption permit must follow the Board's procedures at 49 CFR 1105.9 for compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act, 16 U.S.C. 1451 through 1465, if that act is applicable.
