# § 1180.3   Definitions.

(a) *Applicant.* The term *applicant* means the parties initiating a transaction, but does not include a wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiary of an applicant if that subsidiary is not a rail carrier. Parties who are considered applicants, but for whom the information normally required of an applicant need *not* be submitted, are:


(1) In *minor* trackage rights applications, the transferor and 


(2) In responsive applications, a primary applicant.


(b) *Applicant carriers.* The term *applicant carriers* means: any applicant that is a rail carrier; any rail carrier operating in the United States, Canada, and/or Mexico in which an applicant holds a controlling interest; and all other rail carriers involved in the transaction. Because the service provided by these commonly controlled carriers can be an important competitive aspect of the transactions that we approve, applicant carriers are subject to the full range of our conditioning power. Carriers that are involved in an application only by virtue of an existing trackage rights agreement with applicants are not applicant carriers.


(c) *Major market extension.* A major market extension is a transaction which may significantly increase competition by extending service into a new market, expanding service in a currently served market when another carrier concurrently contracts its service to that market as part of the same transaction, or providing significantly more efficient and effective competitive service to a market presently being served. Criteria which can be used to determine if a railroad is proposing to provide a more competitive service to a currently served area include: (1) Creating a shorter route; (2) providing enhanced service capabilities (speed is not the only factor); (3) entering an interchange or market generating more than 5,000 cars per year or 5 percent of applicant's traffic; (4) filing the application as a condition of relief to a pending proceeding; and (5) permitting a carrier to become more competitive (extending its length of haul) See. *Burlington Northern, Inc.—Control & Merger—St. L.,* 354 I.C.C. 616, 617 (1978).


(d) *Petition for clarification.* A request that the Board clarify the applicability of any part of these regulations to a particular situation or explain the type of material needed to comply with these regulations.


(e) *Petition for waiver.* A request that the Board either dispense with material required by the regulations, or accept material in place of that required by these regulations.


(f) *Primary application.* A proposal for approval filed under 49 U.S.C. 11323 which begins a new proceeding and is not proposed either as a condition to or as an alternative to Board approval of another pending application.


(g) *Railroad.* Any common carrier by railroad as defined in 49 U.S.C. 10102(5)-(6).


(h) *Responsive applications.* Applications filed in response to a primary application are those seeking affirmative relief either as a condition to or in lieu of the approval of the primary application. Responsive applications include inconsistent applications, inclusion applications, and any other affirmative relief that requires an application, petition, notice, or any other filing to be submitted to the Board (such as trackage rights, purchases, constructions, operation, pooling, terminal operations, abandonments, and other types of proceedings not otherwise covered). For fees covering inconsistent applications or responsive applications not otherwise covered in the Board's fee schedule, see 49 CFR 1002.2(f) (38)-(41) and 1180.4(d)(2). The fees for all other responsive applications are set forth in 49 CFR 1002.2(f).


(i) *Transferee.* The transferee is: 


(1) The acquiring corporation in a control proceeding, 


(2) The surviving corporation in a merger, 


(3) The resulting corporation in a consolidation, 


(4) The leasee in a lease, 


(5) The purchaser in an acquisition, and 


(6) The grantee of trackage rights in a trackage rights proceeding. 


(j) *Transferor.* The transferor is: 


(1) The corporation acquired in a control proceeding, 


(2) The merging corporation in a merger, 


(3) All corporations to be consolidated in a consolidation, 


(4) The lessor in a lease, 


(5) The seller in an acquisition, and 


(6) The grantor of trackage rights in a trackage rights proceeding.
