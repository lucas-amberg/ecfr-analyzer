# PART 1201—RAILROAD COMPANIES


## Authority

**Authority:** 49 U.S.C. 11142 and 11164.




31. *Salvage value* means the amount received from the sale of operating property retired less any expenses in connection with the sale or in preparing the property for sale. If the property is retained for reuse, the salvage value shall be recorded in account 712, Materials and Supplies, or other appropriate account at an amount not to exceed its recorded cost (actual or average), or current market value, whichever is lower.


32. *Segment of a business* refers to a component of an entity whose activities represent a separate major line of business or class of customer. A segment may be in the form of a subsidiary, a division, or a department, and in some cases a joint venture or other non-subsidiary investee, provided that its assets, results of operations, and activities can be clearly distinguished, physically and operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the other assets, results of operations, and activities of the entity. The fact that the results of operations of the segment being sold or abandoned cannot be separately identified strongly suggests that the transaction should not be classified as a disposal of a segment of business.


(a) *Measurement date* means the date on which the management having authority to approve the action commits itself to a formal plan to dispose of a segment of the business, whether by abandonment or sale. The measurement date for disposals requiring Commission approval shall be the service date of the Order authorizing the disposal.


(b) *Disposal date* refers to the date of closing the sale, if the disposal is by sale or the date that operations cease if the disposal is by abandonment.


33. *Service life* means the period between the date when operating property is placed in service and the date of its retirement.


34. *Service value* means the ledger value of operating property less its salvage value (see definition 17).


35. *Track maintenance* is material and labor costs of routine track repairs such as sporadic tie replacement, repair of broken rails, tightening track bolts and track spikes. A more complete list of maintenance items are included in notes to the text of Accounts 8, 9 and 11.


36. *Work equipment* means equipment which can be coupled in a train for movement over the carrier's tracks, and which is used in the carrier's work service. See equipment listing for account 57, *Work equipment.*

1-1 *Classification of carriers.* (a) For purposes of accounting and reporting, carriers are grouped into the following three classes:


*Class I:* Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues of $900 million or more after applying the railroad revenue deflator formula shown in Note A.


*Class II:* Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues of less than $900 million but in excess of $40.4 million after applying the railroad revenue deflator formula shown in Note A.


*Class III:* Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues of $40.4 million or less after applying the railroad revenue deflator formula shown in Note A.


(b)(1) The class to which any carrier belongs shall be determined by annual carrier operating revenues after the railroad revenue deflator adjustment. Families of railroads operating within the United States as a single, integrated rail system will be treated as a single carrier for classification purposes. Upward and downward reclassification will be effected as of January 1 in the year immediately following the third consecutive year of revenue qualification.


(2) If a Class II or Class III carrier's classification is changed based on three years' adjusted revenues the carrier shall complete and file the Classification Index Survey Form with the Board by March 31 of the year following the end of the period to which it relates.


(3) Newly organized carriers shall be classified on the basis of their annual carrier operating revenues after railroad revenue deflator adjustment for the latest period of operation. If actual data are not available, new carriers shall be classified on the basis of their carrier operating revenues known and estimated for a year (after railroad revenue deflator adjustment).


(4) When a business combination occurs, such as a merger, reorganization, or consolidation, the surviving carrier shall be reclassified effective January 1 of the next calendar year on the basis of the combined revenue for the year when the combination occurred (after railroad revenue deflator adjustment).


(5) In unusual circumstances, such as partial liquidation and curtailment or elimination of contracted services, where regulations will unduly burden the carrier, the carrier may request the Board for an exception to the regulations. This request shall be in writing specifying the conditions justifying an exception.


(c) Class I carriers shall keep all of the accounts of this system which are applicable to their operations. Class II and III carriers are not required to maintain the accounts of this system.


(d) All switching and terminal companies, regardless of their operating revenues will be designated Class III carriers.


(e) Unless provided for otherwise, all electric railway carriers, regardless of operating revenues, will be designated Class III carriers.


1-2 *Classification of accounts.* (a) Accounts are prescribed to cover cost of property used in transportation operations and operations incidental thereto and for revenues, expenses, taxes, rents, and other items of income for such operations. Separate accounts are prescribed for investment in property not used in transportation operations and for other investments and income therefrom; for unusual and infrequent items; for operations and disposal of discontinued segments; for extraordinary items and accounting changes; and for assets, liabilities and capital includable in the balance sheet statement. Retained earnings accounts form the connecting link between the income account and the equity section of the balance sheet. They are provided to record the transfer of net income or loss for the year; certain capital transactions; and, when authorized by the Board, other items.


(b) The cost of property, and the revenues, expenses, taxes and rents for miscellaneous operations involving the use of such facilities as hotels, restaurants, grain elevators, storage warehouses, power plants, cold storage plants, etc., shall not be included in the accounts prescribed for transportation operations unless the operation of the facilities is conducted by the railway companies in connection with furnishing transportation services. Likewise, the cost of property, the revenues, expenses, taxes, and rents arising from the operation of stockyards shall not be included in accounts prescribed for transportation operations unless operation of the facilities is conducted in connection with transportation of livestock. It is not intended that cost of property and income arising from incidental public stockyards service rendered by stockyards primarily devoted to transportation services shall be excluded from transportation operation accounts.


(c) Joint facility accounts are provided for the joint users of tracks, bridges, yards, wharves, stations, and other facilities in which to record items in settlement for use of such facilities. When the compensation for the use of facilities is a fixed amount or is based upon a charge per passenger, ton, car or other unit, the amount shall be fairly apportioned by the operating company among the joint facility operating expense and income accounts. The creditor shall show the distribution of these charges upon its bills, and such distribution shall be adhered to by the debtor. Train service in connection with the line haul of traffic, including that operated under a joint arrangement for the benefit of two or more carriers, is not considered a joint facility operation.


(d)(1) *Extraordinary Items.* All items of profit and loss recognized during the year are includable in ordinary income unless evidence clearly supports their classification as extraordinary items.


Extraordinary items are characterized by both their unusual nature and infrequent occurrence taking into account the environment in which the firm operates; they must also meet the materiality standard.


Unusual means the event or transaction must possess a high degree of abnormality and be of a type clearly unrelated to, or only incidentally related to the ordinary and typical activities of the entity.


Infrequent occurrence means the event or transaction shall be of a type not reasonably expected to recur in the foreseeable future.


(2) *Unusual or Infrequent Items.* Material events unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence but not both, thus not meeting both criteria for classification as extraordinary, shall be includable in the accounts provided as separate components of income/expense from continuing operations.


(3) *Discontinued Operations.* The results of continuing operations shall be reported separately from discontinued operations and any gain or loss resulting from disposal of a segment of a business (see definition 23(a)) shall be reported in conjunction with the related results of discontinued operations and not as an extraordinary item. The disposal of a segment of a business shall be distinguished from other disposals of assets incident to the evolution of the entity's business, such as the disposal of part of a line of business, the shifting of production or marketing activities for a particular line of business from one location to another, the phasing out of a product line or class of service, and other changes occasioned by technological improvements. If a loss is expected from the proposed sale or abandonment of a segment, the estimated loss shall be provided for at the measurement date (see definition 23(b)). If a gain is expected, it shall be recognized when realized, which ordinarily is the disposal date (see definition 23(c)).


(4) *Prior period adjustments.* Only the following two items of profit and loss shall be accounted for and reported as prior period adjustments and excluded from the determination of net income for the current period:


(1) Correction of an error in the financial statements of a prior period, and


(2) Adjustments that result from realization of income tax benefits of preacquisition operating loss carryforwards of purchased subsidiaries.


With the exception of the two items just mentioned, all items of profit and loss recognized during a period shall be included in the determination of net income for that period.


(5) *Accounting Changes.* Errors in financial statements result from mathematical mistakes, mistakes in the application of accounting principles, or oversight or misuse of facts that existed at the time the financial statements were prepared. In contrast, a change in an accounting estimate results from new information or subsequent developments and from better insight or judgment. Correction of an error should be accomplished through a prior period adjustment [See Instruction 1-2(d)(4)]. Changes in an accounting estimate should be accounted for in the period of change (and future period if the change affects both)(See Instruction 1-7). A change in an accounting principle or accounting entity should be referred to this Board for approval. The cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle should ordinarily be reflected in the account provided for in determining net income.


(6) *Materiality.* As a general standard an item shall be considered material when it exceeds 10 percent of annual income (loss) before extraordinary items. An item may also be considered in relation to the trend of annual earnings before extraordinary items or other appropriate criteria. Items shall be considered individually and not in the aggregate in determining materiality. However, the effects of a series of related transactions arising from a single specific and identifiable event or plan of action shall be aggregated to determine materiality.


(7) *Board Approval and Accountant's Letter.* Items shall be included in the accounts provided for extraordinary items, unusual or infrequent items, discontinued operations, prior period adjustments and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles only upon approval of the Board. If the carrier retains the service of an independent accountant, a request for using these accounts shall be accompanied by a letter from the independent accountant approving or otherwise commenting on the request.


1-3 *Records.* (a) Each carrier shall keep its books of account, and all other books, records, and memoranda which support the entries in such books of account so as to be able to furnish readily full information as to any item included in any account. Each entry shall be supported by such detailed information as will permit ready identification, analysis, and verification of all facts relevant thereto.


(b) All expenditures including the expense accounts of officers and employees shall be supported by vouchers, payrolls, receipted bills, canceled checks, receipts for petty cash payments, or other evidences of the expenditures incurred.


(c) The books referred to herein include not only books of accounts in a limited technical sense but all other records such as minute books, stock books, reports, correspondence, memoranda, etc., which will be useful in developing the history of or facts regarding any transaction.


(d) No carrier shall destroy any books, records, memoranda, etc., which support entries to its accounts unless destruction is permitted by the regulations governing preservation of records, Part 1220 of this chapter.


(e) In addition to prescribed accounts, clearing accounts, temporary accounts, and subdivisions of any accounts may be kept, provided the integrity of the prescribed accounts is not impaired.


(f) Cost detail shall be maintained by cost centers for purposes of cost assignments effective 1-1-79. This provides for cost control and cost planning at any designated area of responsibility. These cost centers shall be similarly defined as the railroads' existing responsibility centers. Cost center information shall therefore be kept at the same level of detail presently collected, categorized, and maintained in railroad internal managerial accounting systems. This detailed information shall not be reported to the Board on an ongoing basis. However, the carrier shall keep the detailed information to provide a ready analysis and verification of the costs collected by cost center.


1-4 *Accounting period.* (a) Each carrier shall keep its books on a monthly basis so that known transactions, as nearly as may be ascertained, shall be entered in the accounts not later than 60 days after the last day of the period for which the accounts are stated, except that the time within which the final entries for the year ending December 31 shall be made may be extended to such date in the following March as shall not interfere with the preparation and filing of annual report.


(b) A trial balance of the general ledger accounts shall be prepared at the close of each month setting out the account number, title, and amount of each ledger account. (Mechanical, electronic or automatic data processing printout documentation producing the equivalent of manually prepared trial balances shall identify balances by account numbers.) At the end of the calendar year, the revenue, expense, and other income accounts shall be closed into retained earnings account, and the balance sheet account balances shall be brought forward to the general ledger for the succeeding year.


(c) No changes shall be made in the accounts for periods covered by quarterly and annual reports that have been filed with the Board unless the changes have first been authorized by the Board.


1-5 *Accrual method of accounting.* The accounting for operating revenues, operating expenses, income and other items each month and year shall be, as nearly as practicable, upon the basis of accruals consistently applied. Any change in practice of accounting for accruals or any unusual accruals involving material amounts shall be reported promptly to the Board.


1-6 *Charges to be just and reasonable.* All charges to the accounts prescribed in this system of accounts for carrier property, operating revenues, operating and maintenance expenses, and other carrier expenses, shall be just, reasonable and not exceed amounts necessary to the honest and efficient operation and management of carrier business. Payments shall not exceed the fair market value of goods and services acquired in an arm's length transaction. Any payments in excess of such just and reasonable charges shall be included in account 551, *Miscellaneous income charges.*

1-7 *Changes in accounting estimates.* Changes in accounting estimate arising during the current year which are applicable to prior years shall be included in the same account which would have been charged or credited if the item had been taken up or the adjustment made in the year to which it pertained. [See Instruction 1-2(d)(5) for Accounting Changes].


1-8 *Accounting for computer systems and word processing costs.* (a) Capitalized costs for computer systems and word processing equipment shall be charged to property account 59, when such costs are not dedicated to a particular function (See Account 59). Related depreciation expenses for capitalized costs shall be charged to account 62-23-00, Depreciation, Other Equipment.


(b) Repair and maintenance costs related to computer systems and word processing equipment shall be charged to function 46 of the Other equipment subactivity by appropriate natural expense (labor, material, purchased services, other). Repairs performed by an outside company shall be charged to operating expense account 39-23-46.


(c) Operating costs related to computer systems and word processing equipment shall be charged to function 87, Management services and data and word processing, when the equipment benefits more than one activity. When the equipment benefits one activity only, such operating costs shall be charged to the activity/function benefited.


1-9 *Transactions with affiliated companies.* (a) The records and supporting data of all transactions with affiliated companies shall be maintained in a separate file. The types of transactions referred to in this paragraph are for management services or any other type of services rendered, sale or use of facilities or any other type of assets or property. The file shall be maintained so as to enable the carrier, upon a Board request, to furnish accurate information with supporting documentation about particular transactions within 15 days of the request. We do not intend the file to include data relating to ordinary carrier operations (e.g. lawful tariff charges or interchange of equipment).


(b) Each bill rendered by an affiliated company shall state specifically the basis used for determining charges, unless the file contains the information to support the specific basis for charges.


(c) Punched cards, magnetic tapes, discs, or other machine-sensible devices used for recording, consolidating, and summarizing accounting transactions and records with a carrier's electronic or automatic data processing system may constitute a file within the meaning of this instruction.


(d) The carrier shall record, as the cost of assets or services received from an affiliated supplier, the invoice price (plus any incidental costs related to those transactions) in those cases where the invoice price can be determined from a prevailing price list of the affiliated supplier available to the general public in the normal course of business. If no such price list exists, the charges shall be recorded at the lower of their cost to the originating affiliated supplier (less all applicable valuation reserves in case of asset sales, or their estimated fair market value determined on the basis of a representative study of similar competitive and arm's-length or bargained transaction. Any difference between actual transaction price and the above, as well as charges that are not transportation related, shall be considered of a financing nature and shall be recorded, accordingly, as nonoperating charges or credits. (See instruction 1-6.)


(e) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as restraining the carrier from subdividing accounts (see instruction I-3(e)) for the purpose of recording separately transactions with affiliated companies.


(f) Carriers reporting information on a consolidated or combined basis in railroad Annual Report Form R-1 shall maintain a file with appropriate records and supporting data. This shall include work sheets showing revenues, expenses, earnings, investment in assets and accumulated depreciation for all affiliated railroads and rail-related affiliated companies. The work sheets shall also disclose any eliminations. Carriers shall also disclose the methodology used to support segregation of rail-related or other items as appropriate. Further, a file shall be maintained to support and reconcile entity sales, transfers and reclassifications as well as taxes deducted from gains or losses.


1-10 *Accounting for income taxes.* (a) The interperiod tax allocation method of accounting shall be applied where material timing differences (see definition 17(e)) occur between pretax accounting income and taxable income. Carriers may elect, as provided by the Revenue Act of 1971, to account for the investment tax credit by either the flow through method or the deferred method of accounting. See paragraphs (d) and (e) below. All income taxes (Federal, state and other) currently accruable for income tax return purposes shall be charged to account 556, *Income taxes on ordinary income,* and account 590, *Income Taxes on Extraordinary Items,* as applicable.


(b) Under the interperiod tax allocation method of accounting the tax effect of timing differences (see definition 17) originating in the current accounting period are allocated to income tax expense of future periods when the timing differences reverse. Similar timing differences originating and reversing in the current accounting period should be combined into groups and the current tax rates applied to determine the tax effect of each group. A carrier shall not apply other than current tax rates in determining the tax effect of reversing differences except upon approval of the Board. When determining the amount of deferred taxes, rather than computing state and other taxes individually by jurisdiction, the Federal income tax rate may be increased by a percent equivalent to the effect of taxes imposed by the jurisdictions. In classifying a deferred charge or credit as current or noncurrent a carrier shall follow the classification criteria used for the related asset or liability which caused the timing difference. A deferred charge or credit that is not related to an asset or liability because (a) there is no associated asset or liability or (b) reduction of an associated asset or liability will not cause the timing difference to reverse shall be classified based on the expected reversal date of the specific timing difference. Such classification disregards any additional timing differences that may arise and is based on the criteria used for classifying other assets and liabilities.


(c) The future tax benefits of loss carryforwards shall normally be recognized in the year in which such loss is applied to reduce taxes. Only in those unusual instances when realization is assured beyond any reasonable doubt should the future tax benefits of loss carryforwards be recognized in the year of loss. The tax effects of any realizable loss carrybacks shall be recognized in the determination of net income (loss) of the loss periods; appropriate adjustments of existing net deferred tax credits may also be necessary in the loss period.


(d) Carriers electing to account for the investment tax credit by the flow through method shall credit account 556 *Income taxes on ordinary income,* or account 590, *Income taxes on extraordinary items,* as applicable, and charge account 760, *Federal income taxes accrued,* with the amount of investment tax credit utilized in the current accounting period. When the flow through method is followed for the investment tax credit, account 557, *Provision for Deferred Taxes,* shall reflect the difference between the tax payable (after recognition of allowable investment tax credit) based on taxable income and tax expense (with full recognition of investment tax credit that would be allowable based on accounting income) based on accounting income.


(e) Carriers electing to account for the investment tax credit by the deferred method shall concurrently with making the entries prescribed in (d) above charge account 557, *Provision for deferred taxes,* or account 591, *Provision for deferred taxes—extraordinary item,* as applicable, and shall credit account 786, *Accumulated deferred income tax credits,* with the investment tax credit utilized as a reduction of the current year's tax liability but deferred for accounting purposes. The investment tax credit so deferred shall be amortized by credits to account 557, *Provision for deferred taxes.*

1-11 *Items in texts of accounts.* The items appearing in the texts of the accounts or elsewhere herein are for the purpose of more clearly indicating the application of the prescribed accounting. The items are intended to be representative, but not exhaustive. The appearance of an item in the text of a primary account warrants the inclusion of the item in the account mentioned only when the whole text also indicates inclusion inasmuch as the same item frequently appears in more than one primary account. The proper entry in each instance must be determined by the entire text of each primary account.


1-12 *Distribution of pay and expenses of employees.* (a) The pay and expenses of officers or employees regularly assigned to specific duties who perform incidental services of a different nature involving small expense may be included in the appropriate expense accounts for the duties to which such officers or employees are regularly assigned.


(b) When it is necessary to apportion the pay of officers and employees among various accounts, the carrier shall apportion the pay on the basis of the directly assignable pay to the various accounts.


1-13 *Payroll related expenses.* (a) Fringe benefits (account series 12-00-00) distributed to the activities using one of the following techniques (in order of preference):


(1) Apply appropriate factors to the total of the fringe expense account, in such a way as to distribute an equitable proportion of cost to each activity. These factors shall be developed to take into account variables such as the following:


(i) The effect of seniority on the expense. For example, profit sharing or pensions may be available to only certain categories of employees, which may be more predominant in one activity than another.


(ii) The effect of the type of work performed. For example, workmen's compensation expense may vary for each category of employees because of the rate charged or the claims experience of the category.


(iii) Any other variable which may have an appreciable effect on the equity of the apportionment.


(2) Distribute the amount in the same proportion as the pay charged to each activity in account series 11-00-00 (salaries and wages).


(3) Distribute the amounts using any other equitable basis which the carrier can substantiate.


(b) All carriers shall be prepared to describe the basis of apportionment used to distribute expenses included in this instruction.


(c) Any carrier which finds it impracticable to distribute expenses as required by this instruction should furnish the Board with full particulars of the conditions which prevent the proper distribution. Upon receipt of such information carrier will be advised of the procedure to be followed.


1-14 *Submission of questions.* To maintain uniformity of accounting, carriers shall submit questions of doubtful interpretation to the Board for consideration and decision.


1-15 *Transfers from government authorities.* When a Federal, State, or municipal government transfers cash or other assets to a railroad, the transaction shall be accounted for in accordance with the provisions set forth hereunder.


(a) The following forms of government transfers shall be included in account 502, *Railway Operating Revenues—Transfers from Government Authorities for Current Operations* when received:


(1) Payments as reimbursement for operating losses sustained on a specific line, or in a certain region. Examples include support of commuter operations of a railroad, and local rail service assistance subsidies granted to a railroad under authority of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976;


(2) Subsidies designated by the donor to offset operating expenses of the railroad, and


(3) Subsidies which may be applied at the discretion of the recipient to operating expenses and/or operating property.


(b) Government transfers relating to the acquisition, addition to, or improvement of depreciable operating property shall be included in account 783, *Deferred Revenues—Transfers from Government Authorities* when received. Account 783 shall be periodically charged, and account 503, *Railway Operating Revenues—Amortization of Deferred Transfers from Government Authorities* shall be credited with amounts equal to the depreciation costs of the assets to which they apply.


(c) Government transfers in the form of, or designated for the purchase of nondepreciable operating property shall be included in account 796, *Other Capital Surplus* in the manner described in the text of that account.


(d)(1) Transfers from the Federal Government to Amtrak and ConRail relating to the acquisitions, addition to, or improvement of depreciable or nondepreciable operating property shall be included in account 796 in the manner described in the text of that account.


(2) Transfers from the Federal Government to Amtrak and ConRail other than those described in paragraph (d)(1) shall be accounted for in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.


(e) The provisions of this section do not apply to the following forms of government transfers:


(1) Government contributions in connection with construction projects in which government agencies and railroads participate. Transfers of this type shall be accounted for in accordance with the provisions of instruction 2-17. Paragraph (b) of that instruction lists applicable construction projects.


(2) Government payment for specific services rendered by the carrier in transporting property or persons by rail line other than services described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Such payments shall be included in account 501, *Railway Operating Revenues (Exclusive of Transfers from Government Authorities).*

(3) Government transfers relating to other than carrier operations.


(4) Government transfers in exchange for debt and/or equity securities of recipients.


(f) Government transfers shall generally be recorded when made available to the railroad. However, transfers relating to specific operations shall be recorded as earned.


(g) Government transfers in the form of assets other than cash shall be recorded at fair value when received.


1-16 *Business entertainment expenses.* (a) Business entertainment expenses are to be accounted for as operating expenses when incurred in conjunction with sales or marketing related activities. Sales or marketing related activities are those that emphasize a carrier's ability to provide efficient, timely and competitive service. These activities include outlays designed to promote new business as well as outlays incurred in maintaining existing business. The entertainment expenditures must be reasonable in relation to the business conducted and the business purpose for the entertainment must be adequately supported. Examples of this type of activity include the following:


(1) Salespersons' salaries and travel expenses, advertising, promotional and educational material;


(2) The conduct of shipper symposiums, conferences, meetings and traffic related functions;


(3) The use of direct mail solicitations and the publication and distribution of routing guides and service directories;


(4) Incidental promotional materials such as road atlases, calendars, pens, scratchpads, and other materials of nominal value;


(5) The conduct of business oriented lunches and dinners, public affairs programming, conferences and customer service calls;


(6) Sponsoring sales promotion functions, involving a number of customers or potential customers.


(b) Business entertainment expenses are to be accounted for as non-operating expenses when they cannot be shown to be related to the sales or marketing activity. These are expenses that are primarily related to recreation or to the convenience and comfort of the individuals rather than to the transaction of business. Examples of this type of activity include the following:


(1) Recreational or resort entertainment, including but not limited to, fishing, hunting, tennis, golfing, skiing or other sporting or recreational trips or outings;


(2) Expense paid transportation in any carrier owned, leased or furnished vehicles, planes, helicopters, boats, yachts, or other methods;


(3) Expense paid lodging in any carrier owned, leased or furnished motels, hotels, apartments, condominiums, lodges, rooms and other places of overnight accommodation;


(4) Paid admission to any sporting, cultural, educational, recreational, or entertaining occurrence or event;


(5) Gifts such as athletic equipment, food or liquor, beverages of all types, smoking materials, clothing and personal accessories;


(6) The furnishing of lunches, dinners, appetizers or beverages where there is no true business purpose;


(7) Social occasions such as holiday parties.


1-17 *Disclosure guideline.* In addition to the accounting policies presented in these regulations, all disclosures relating to APB Opinions and FASB Statements adopted by the Board are required.


1-18 *Distribution of expenses for material, tools, fuel, lubricants, purchased services and general.* (a) These expenses shall be assigned directly to activities based on usage whenever possible.


(b) When it is necessary to apportion these expenses to two or more activities they shall be equitably apportioned only to the activities in which they are actually used or to the activities they support.


1-19 *Accounting for Other Comprehensive Income.* (a) Railroads will record items of Other Comprehensive Income in account 799.1, *Other comprehensive income.* Amounts included in this account will be maintained by each category of Other Comprehensive Income. Examples of categories of Other Comprehensive Income include foreign currency items, minimum pension liability adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale type securities and cash-flow hedge amounts.


(b) Supporting records will be maintained for account 799 so that the company can readily identify the cumulative amount of Other Comprehensive Income for each item included in this account.


(c) When an item of Other Comprehensive Income enters into the determination of earnings in the current or subsequent periods, a reclassification adjustment will be recorded in account 799 to avoid double counting of when an item included in net income was also included in Other Comprehensive Income in the same or prior period.


1-20 *Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities.* (a) A carrier will recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the financial statements and measure those instruments at fair value. A derivative instrument is a financial instrument or other contract with all three of the following characteristics:


(1) The derivative instrument has one or more underlyings and a notional amount or payment provision. Those terms determine the amount of the settlement or settlements, and, in some cases, whether or not a settlement is required.


(2) The derivative instrument requires no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have similar responses to changes in market factors.


(3) The derivative instrument's terms require or permit net settlement; the derivative instrument can readily be settled net by a means outside the contract; or the derivative instrument's terms provide for delivery of an asset that puts the recipient in a position not substantially different from net settlement.


(b) The accounting for the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments depends upon their intended use and designation. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges will be recorded in account 713.5, *Derivative instrument assets,* or account 763.5, *Derivative instrument liabilities,* as appropriate, with the gains or losses charged to earnings in account 551, *Miscellaneous income charges*.


(c) A derivative instrument may be specifically designated as a fair-value or cash-flow hedge. A hedge may be used to manage risk to price, interest rates, or foreign currency transactions. An entity will maintain documentation of the hedge relationship at the inception of the hedge that details the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how hedge effectiveness will be determined.


(d) If the carrier designates the derivative instrument as a fair-value hedge against exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset, liability, or a firm commitment, it will record the change in fair value of the derivative instrument designated as a fair-value hedge to account 713.6, *Derivative instruments assets—hedges,* or account 763.6, *Derivative instrument liabilities—hedges,* as appropriate, with a corresponding adjustment to the sub-account of the item being hedged. The ineffective portion of the hedge transaction will be reflected in the same income or expense account that would have been used if the hedged item had been disposed of or settled. In the case of a fair-value hedge of a firm commitment, a new asset or liability is created. As a result of the hedge relationship, the new asset or liability will become part of the carrying amount of the item being hedged.


(e) If the carrier designates the derivative instrument as a cash-flow hedge against exposure to variable cash flows of a probable forecasted transaction, it will record changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument in account 713.6, *Derivative instrument assets—hedges,* or account 763.6, *Derivative instrument liabilities—hedges,* as appropriate, with a corresponding amount in account 799.1, *Other comprehensive income,* for the effective portion of the hedge. The ineffective portion of the hedge transaction will be reflected in the same income or expense account that would have been used if the hedged item had been disposed of or settled. Amounts recorded in Other Comprehensive Income will be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods that the hedged forecasted item affects earnings.


2-1 *Items to be charged.* (a) To the road and equipment property accounts shall be charged the cost of purchasing land, the cost of purchasing and constructing buildings, facilities and equipment, and the cost of additions and betterments to property, *Cost* means the amount of cash disbursed, or the fair value of other assets distributed, or the present value of amounts to be paid. Where the fair market value of resources given up (assets, services or items of stockholder's equity) is not clearly determinable, the cost may be determined by the fair market value of the resources acquired. The carrier shall be prepared to furnish the Board with the particulars of its method of determining cash value when the consideration is other than monetary. The amount of liabilities incurred with suppliers in the normal course of business, which are due in customary trade terms not exceeding approximately one year, shall be recorded at the maturity value. Acquisition date is the date title passes to the carrier.


(b) The cost of road and equipment purchased under a plan involving other deferred payments (debt or capital lease) shall be recorded at the discounted present value of the payment, net of executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes. The interest rate used to discount the payments should be the prevailing market rate for similar debt instruments of issues with similar credit ratings. In any event, the rate used for valuation purposes will normally be at least equal to the rate at which the carrier can obtain financing of a similar nature from other sources at the date of the transaction (the carrier's incremental borrowing rate). In the case of a capital lease, when it is practical to ascertain the implicit rate computed by the lessor, and that rate is less than the carrier's incremental borrowing rate, the carrier should use the implicit rate. Acquisition date for a capital lease is the date the lease agreement is signed. If the property covered by the lease has yet to be constructed or has not been acquired by the lessor at the date the lease agreement or commitment is signed, the acquisition date shall be the date the property under construction is completed or the date the property not yet acquired is acquired by the lessor. (See Instruction 2-20.)


(c) Where actually incurred, interest cost is to be added to the cost of road and equipment deemed *qualifying assets* during the period of time required to get them ready for their intended use (acquisition period). *Qualifying assets* are those that are (1) either constructed or otherwise produced for a carrier's own use (including assets constructed or produced for the carrier by others for which deposits or progress payments have been made) or (2) assets intended for sale or lease that are constructed or otherwise produced as discrete projects. The amount of interest to be capitalized for qualifying assets shall be based upon the average amount of accumulated expenditures for the asset during the acquisition period at the rate used on specific new borrowings associated with the qualifying asset. If average accumulated expenditures for the asset exceed the amount of specific new borrowings associated with the asset, the rate to be applied to such excess shall be a weighted average of the rates applicable to other borrowings of the enterprise. The total amount of interest cost capitalized in an accounting period shall not exceed the total amount of interest cost incurred by the enterprise during that period.


(d) Suitable records shall be maintained showing expenditures during the year for original road and equipment and road extensions; for merger and purchase of existing lines and reorganizations; for additions and betterments; and credits for property retirement.


(e) When the carrier exchanges road and equipment for other road and equipment with no other consideration involved, the road and equipment received shall be recorded at the ledger value of the road and equipment relinquished. Where the carrier receives a monetary consideration in the exchange, the carrier shall recognize gain on the exchange to the extent that the consideration received exceeds a proportionate share of the recorded cost of the road and equipment surrendered. The portion of the cost applicable to the realized amount shall be based on the ratio of the monetary consideration to the total consideration received (monetary consideration plus the estimate fair value of the road and equipment received) or, if more clearly evident, the fair value of the road and equipment transferred. Where the carrier pays a monetary consideration in the exchange, it shall not recognize any gain on the transaction but shall record the road and equipment received at the amount of the monetary consideration paid plus the recorded costs of the road and equipment surrendered. If a loss is indicated by the terms of an exchange transaction, the carrier shall recognize the entire loss on the exchange. Immaterial gains and losses on these exchanges shall be included in account 519, Miscellaneous Income, or 551, Miscellaneous Income Charges, as appropriate. Material amounts shall be recorded in accordance with Instruction 1-2(d).


2-2 *Minimum rule applicable to additions to property.* An exception to the rule in Instruction 2-1 is that when the cost of acquisition of units of road property and of additions to existing units of road property (other than land and tracks) is less than $5,000, such costs may be charged to operating expenses. This amount (rounded to the nearest $100) will be adjusted by the June Producer Price Index for all commodities when an aggregate adjustment is $500 or more. The revision will be published in the _Federal Register_ and be effective as of January 1 of the following year. The carrier shall not parcel expenditures under a general plan bringing the accounting for such expenditures within this minimum rule. An amount of less than the current minimum capitalization level, for the railroad as a whole or for individual property accounts may be adopted for purposes of this rule provided the carrier first notifies the Board of the amount it proposes to adopt and thereafter makes no change in the amount unless authorized by the Board. An amount adopted shall be adhered to in reporting property changes for valuation purposes.


2-3 *Land.* (a) Accounts are provided for the cost of land used in transportation operations and also for land used in other than transportation operations. When land is retired from transportation operations but is retained by the carrier the original cost (estimated, if not known) shall be transferred to the account prescribed for property used in other than transportation operations. It is not contemplated that irregular parcels of land acquired in connection with acquisition of right-of-way which have no value as commercial property shall be thus transferred, either for the purpose of making right-of-way boundaries run more or less regular or for the purpose of eliminating from transportation property account the cost of unoccupied lands between tracks in yards and terminals. When any land, the cost of which is included in the accounts, is sold or otherwise retired, the ledger value shall be credited to the appropriate property investment account. The profit or loss from sale or loss from retirement or land shall be included in the accounts prescribed for such amounts.


(b) [Reserved]


2-4 *Structures.* Accounts are provided for the cost of several classes of buildings and facilities, including fixtures permanently attached to and made a part thereof. When a building or other structure is used or held primarily for transportation operations and is an integral part of the carrier's transportation plant, but a part thereof is used or held for commercial purposes such as for rental to others or for use in other than transportation operations by the carrier, the entire cost of the building or other structure is includable in the accounts for transportation property. When a building or other structure is used or held primarily for commercial purposes or for use in other than transportation operations by the carrier, the entire cost of the building or structure is includable in account 737, *Property used in other than carrier operations.* Reclassification of property from its primary classification as transportation or other than transportation property, as the case may be, to the other classification is not required where changes in use are of a temporary nature or for a short period of time. The accounting for costs of maintenance, taxes, other operating costs, and for revenues and rentals shall be consistent with the classification of the building or other structure.


2-5 *Equipment.* Accounts are provided for several classes of equipment, such as locomotives, passenger-train cars, freight-train cars, highway revenue equipment, work equipment, floating equipment, and the necessary appurtenance, furniture, and fixtures first to equip for service, including the cost of inspection, setting up, and trying out, and transportation over foreign lines; also the cost of additions and betterments, such as improved appliances, parts, or appurtenances. When retired equipment is held without being torn down, the estimated value of the salvage therefrom shall be included in account 741, *Other assets,* until the salvage is recovered, except that the estimated scrap value of retired equipment held for sale in the ordinary course of business, and on which sale and realization of the proceeds within one year is assured, is includable in account 713, *Other current assets.*

2-6 *Components of construction cost.* The cost of constructing property includable in the property accounts shall include the direct and other costs as described hereunder.


(a) *Cost of labor.* This includes the amount paid for labor expended by the carrier's own employees, including the cost of labor expended for preliminary work, such as sinking test holes or making soundings for tunnels, grading, buildings, and other structures; and cost of labor expended in laying and taking up tracks for temporary use in construction, except the cost of labor expended on tracks provided for the protection of traffic during the progress of addition and betterment work. The cost of labor shall also include the accounting company's expenditures for associated fringe benefits, such as vacation and holiday pay, health and welfare group insurance, pensions and retirement plans, payroll taxes and unemployment insurance. Office expenses and traveling and other personal expenses of employees, when borne by the carrier, shall be considered a part of the cost of the labor, as shall also the cost of fidelity bonds and employer's liability insurance premiums. When officers or employees are especially assigned to construction work their pay and their traveling and incidental expenses while thus engaged shall be included in the cost of the work. No charge shall be made against road and equipment accounts for the pay of officers and employees who merely render services incidentally in connection with extensions, additions, or betterments, although traveling and incidental expenses incurred by such officers and employees solely on account of such work shall be included in the account to which the cost of the work is chargeable.


(b) *Cost of materials and supplies.* This includes the purchase price of materials and supplies, including small tools, at the point of free delivery plus the cost of inspection and loading assumed by the carrier; a suitable proportion of store expenses; also sales and excise taxes on materials and supplies except as otherwise provided in the text of account 712, *Material and supplies.* In calculating the cost of materials used, proper allowance shall be made for the value of unused portions and of cuttings, turnings, borings, etc.; for the value of the material recovered from temporary tracks, scaffolding, cofferdams, and other temporary structures used in construction; and for the value of small tools recovered and used for other purposes.


(c) *Cost of work-train service.* This includes amounts paid to others for rent and maintenance of equipment used; cost of labor of enginemen, trainmen, and enginehousemen, including wages of engine crews and train crews held in readiness for such service; and cost of fuel and other supplies consumed in connection with the operation of work trains. It shall also include the cost of maintaining the carrier's own equipment used in construction service. Amounts representing constructive rent or return upon the investment in owned equipment shall not be included as a part of the cost of work-train service.


(d) *Cost of special machine service.* This includes the cost of labor expended and of materials and supplies consumed in maintaining and operating power shovels, scrapers, rail unloaders, ballast unloaders, pile drivers, dredges, ditchers, weed burners, and other labor-saving machines; also rents paid for use of such machines.


(e) *Cost of transportation.* This includes the amounts paid to other companies or individuals for the transportation of men, materials and supplies, special machine outfits, appliances, and tools in connection with construction. Freight charges paid foreign lines for the transportation of construction material to the carrier's line shall be included, so far as practicable, as a part of the cost of the material.


(f) *Cost of contract work.* This includes amounts paid for work performed under contract by other companies, firms, or individuals, and costs incident to the award of the contract.


(g) *Cost of protection from casualties.* This includes expenditures for protection against fire, such as payments for discovery or extinguishment of fires, cost of detecting and prosecuting incendiaries, witness fees in relation thereto, amounts paid to municipal corporations and other for fire protection, and other analogous items of expenditure incurred directly in connection with construction work.


(h) *Cost of injuries and damages.* This includes expenditures on account of injuries to persons or damage to property when incurred directly as a result of construction projects, and shall be included in the cost of the work in connection with which the injury or damage occurs. It also includes that portion of premiums paid for insuring property applicable to the period prior to the completion or coming into service of the property insured. Insurance recovered on account of compensation paid for injuries to persons incident to construction shall be credited to the accounts to which such compensation is charged, and insurance recovered on account of damages to property incident to construction shall be credited to the accounts chargeable with the expenditures necessary for restoring the damaged property. The cost of injuries and damages incident to the removal of old structures, or parts thereof, shall be charged to operating expenses, except that such costs in connection with the removal of old structures which are incumberances on newly acquired lands shall be included in accounts 2, *Land for transportation purposes,* or 3, *Grading,* as appropriate.


(i) *Cost of privileges.* This includes compensation for temporary privileges, such as the use of public property or streets, in connection with the construction of the property of the carrier.


(j) *Material excavated.* The cost of disposing of material excavated in connection with construction shall be considered as a part of the cost of work, except that when such material is used for filling, the cost of removal and dumping shall be equitably apportioned between the work in connection with which the removal occurs and the work in connection with which the material is used.


(k) *Interest cost.* [See Instruction 2-1(c)].


2-7 *Additions to and retirements of property—General.* (a) In accounting for additions to and retirements and replacements of road and equipment property (excluding land) used in transportation operations, such property changes shall be considered as consisting of: (1) Units of property, and (2) other than units of property as prescribed in Instruction 2-19. Track property changes will be distinguished by units of property as approved by the Commission.


(b) The cost of removal of retired property, both depreciable and other than depreciable, when borne by the carrier, shall be charged, as appropriate, to account 11-13-39, *Personnel—Salaries and Wages—Way and Structures—Other—Dismantling retired property,* or 11-23-39. *Personnel—Salaries and Wages—Equipment—Other Equipment—Dismantling retired property,* and other appropriate accounts (including subactivities 11 and 12). 
1

(c) An equitable proportion of a balance in property accounts 76, *Interest During Construction,* and 80, *Other elements of investment,* applicable to retired property shall be cleared from these accounts concurrently with the retirement accounting. Unless provided for otherwise, interest costs shall be capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.


(d) When retired property is held and not removed, the estimated value of the salvage therefrom shall be included in account 741, *Other assets,* until the salvage is recovered, except that the estimated scrap value of retired property held for sale in the ordinary course of business, and on which sale and realization of the proceeds within one year is assured, is includible in account 713, *Other current assets.*

(e) The accounting for track additions and retirements (with and without replacement) shall be guided by Instruction 2-10.


2-8 *Additions to and retirements of units of property.* (a) When a unit of road or equipment property is added to the plant, the cost thereof shall be included in the appropriate primary account. When a unit of property is retired, with or without replacement, the cost thereof shall be written out of the property account at time of retirement.


(b) When a unit of road or equipment property (or a minor item not replaced) classified as depreciable and included in the accounts prescribed for depreciable property is retired the service value shall be charged to account 735, *Accumulated depreciation; Road and equipment property.*

(c) When road property (other than a minor item constituting repairs) classified as other than depreciable property is retired, the cost thereof shall be cleared from the property account and the service value shall be charged to account 61-13-99, *General—Other Expenses—Way and Structures—Other—Other.* When the retirement requires Board approval, the carrier shall clear the cost from the property account upon the effective date of the abandonment. Subactivities 11 and 12 also apply.


(d) When property included in the depreciable accounts but excluded from the depreciation base is retired, the service value (including engineering expenditures assignable to retired property but not included in the depreciation base) shall be charged to operating expense.


2-9 *Additions and retirements of other than units of property.* (a) When an item of road or equipment property, other than a complete unit, is added to the plant and the addition is not a replacement, the cost thereof shall be accounted for in the same manner as an addition of a complete unit of property, subject to the minimum rule applicable to road property (see Instruction 2-2). When an item of property other than a complete unit (minor item) is replaced, independent of the complete unit of which it is a part, the cost of replacement shall be treated as maintenance and charged to operating expenses. If the replacement constitutes an improvement then the cost of replacement should be accounted for as a rebuilding expenditure under Instruction 2-12.


(b) When second-hand property acquired is in such physical condition that it is necessary to rehabilitate the property to bring it up to the standard required by the carrier, the cost of such rehabilitation shall be included in the appropriate account for the property.


2-10 *Additions to and retirements of track.*

(a) When track or its components are added to the plant, the cost shall be included in the track primary account. When track components are replaced as part of a track replacement program, the replacement cost shall be accounted for as an addition to the track property account. The cost of track components which are retired with or without replacement shall be written out of the track property account at the time of retirement.


(b) When track is retired the service value (ledger value less net salvage) shall be charged to account 735, *Accumulated depreciation; Road and equipment property.*

(c) All repairs of tracks shall be accounted for as operating expenses.


(d) Track investment written out of the accounts shall be at original cost or estimated standard or average cost for that density category. Material to be reused shall be put in an investment pool at unrecovered cost and, when reused, included in the appropriate density category at the average cost of the investment pool.


2-11 *Expenses in connection with additions and betterments.* The cost of removing old material from equipment and from buildings, bridges, wharves, tracks, and other fixed improvements, shall be charged to the appropriate operating expense accounts. Such charges shall include the cost of removing old foundations and filling old excavations, and restoring condition of grounds after addition and betterment work; and maintaining or protecting traffic during the progress of addition and betterment work, including the cost of constructing, maintaining, and removing temporary tracks required for maintaining traffic during the progress of the work.


2-12 *Units of property rebuilt or converted*—(a) *Rebuilding expenditures.* Carriers shall be governed by the following provisions when determining and accounting for depreciable road and equipment property rebuilding expenditures:


(1) Rebuilding expenditures are those cost actually incurred which substantially extend the service life or substantially increase the utility of depreciable road and equipment property. The rebuilding expenditures shall be material in nature relative to the current replacement cost of a similar new unit of road or equipment property. Expenses resulting from delayed maintenance and repairs shall not be considered in determining materiality.


(2) The phrase *extend the service life* means to extend the life of a property unit past its estimated service life.


(3) The term *increased utility* means that the road or equipment property has become more useful, more efficient, more durable, or has greater capacity.


(4) Rebuilt or converted road or equipment property shall be accounted for as an addition to the appropriate property accounts, with the old units accounted for as retired from service. The charge to the appropriate property accounts shall be composed of (i) the cost (estimated if necessary) less a fair allowance for depreciation, or salvage value, whichever is lower, of the parts reused, (ii) the cost of labor expended in rebuilding or in the conversion process, (iii) the cost of additional materials applied, and (iv) any other expenses incurred directly with the rebuilding or conversion. In no case shall the total amount charged to the property accounts for these units exceed the current replacement costs of similar new units that would be used for the same purpose. When a unit of road property or equipment is transferred from one class of service to another, with or without physical conversion, the unit shall be accounted for as retired from its original account and be recorded in a primary investment account appropriate to its new class of service.


(5) If it is necessary to repair the secondhand or reused parts remaining in a rebuilt unit, the repair cost may be added to the value assigned parts in determining the related cost to be capitalized. Associated dismantling costs shall be included in operating expenses.


(b) *Repair expenses.* Expenses pertaining to road and equipment property, which represent normal or delayed repairs and maintenance, shall be expensed in the year incurred.


(c) *File and Storage.* Carriers shall keep records of each rebuilding program readily available. These records shall be provided to representatives of the Board when requested. The retention period shall be as required by 49 CFR part 1220, Preservation of Records.


2-13 *Changes in line of road and relocation of yard tracks.*

(a) When changes are made in a line of road for the purpose of reducing curves or grades, or to eliminate bridges, tunnels, tracks in the installation of a centralized traffic control system, or other physical features, the part of the line so changed shall be considered property retired and its ledger value credited to the property accounts. The new line of road, including land, grading, ballast, track elements, and other transportation facilities serving the road shall be considered an addition and the cost charged to the property accounts. The cost of track changes which do not involve change in the existing roadbed shall be charged to operating expenses, even though the tracks may be dismantled in the process, but the resulting track extensions or reductions shall be accounted for as additions or retirements as appropriate.


(b) The cost of shifting or rearranging tracks within a yard shall be charged to operating expenses, even though the tracks may be dismantled in the process, but resulting increases or decreases in grading, ballast, or track length shall be accounted for as additions or retirements, as appropriate. Where tracks in whole or in part within a yard are determined to be no longer permanently used, the ledger value of such tracks shall be eliminated from the property account. If yard tracks and facilities are constructed in another location to take the place of tracks retired, such tracks and facilities shall be accounted for as additions and the cost thereof shall be included in the property account.


2-14 *Track connections.* (a) When the accounting carrier bears the construction cost of a connecting track situated on the property of another carrier, but acquires the salvage rights to the track, the cost of the track construction shall be charged to account 731, *Road and equipment property.*

(b) When carriers (1) share the cost of constructing a connecting track of which a portion is situated on each carrier's right-of-way, and (2) own and obtain the salvage rights to the track segment located on their respective properties, the construction cost borne by each carrier shall be charged to account 731, *Road and equipment property.*

(c) The cost of constructing a track connection on the right-of-way of another carrier which acquires the ownership of and salvage rights to the track, shall be charged by the carrier bearing such cost to accounts 37-11-00, *Purchased service—Joint facility—Debit—Way and Structures—Running,* or 37-12-00, *Purchased services—Joint facility—Debit—Way and Structures—Switching.* The owner carrier shall charge the amount of the construction cost to account 731, *Road and equipment—property,* with contra credit to accounts 38-11-00, *Purchases services—Joint facility—Credit—Way and Structures—Running,* or 38-12-00, *Purchases services—Joint facility—Credit—Way and Structures—Switching.* Material amounts for such costs shall be referred to the Board for consideration and decision.


(d) The cost of constructing a side track under a deposit refund agreement shall be charged to account 731, *Road and equipment property.* The deposit shall be credited to account 782, *Other liabilities.* Deposit amounts refunded during the agreement period shall be charged to account 782, *Other liabilities.* Upon termination of the agreement, the amount of any unrefunded deposit shall be credited to the applicable primary property accounts on an equitable basis.


2-15 *Merger, consolidation, and purchase of a railway operating entity or system.*

(a) When a railway or portion thereof constituting an operating unit or system is acquired in a business combination, that business combination shall be recorded in the accounts in the manner stated hereunder. 


(b) Purchase:


(1) The amount includable in account 731, Road and equipment property, shall be the cost at the date of acquisition to the purchaser of the transportation property acquired. The cost assigned the property, as well as other assets acquired, shall be the amount of the cost consideration given. Where property and other assets are acquired for other than cash, including liabilities assumed and shares of stock issued, cost shall be determined by either the fair value of the consideration given or the fair value of the assets acquired, whichever is more clearly evident. In addition to any liabilities assumed, provision shall be made for such estimated liabilities as may be necessary.


(2) When the costs of individual units or classes of transportation property are not specified in the agreement, the cost assigned such property shall be apportioned among the appropriate primary accounts using the percentage relationship between the fair values for each class of property acquired and the total of such values.


(c) Merger of subsidiaries:


The acquisition and merger of property of subsidiaries controlled through ownership of the majority shares of voting stock is to be accounted for using the acquisition accounting methodology.


2-16 *Reorganization of railway.* (a) When a railway reorganization or receivership has been consummated, the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and the capital stock or other securities issued or assumed, and other consideration, shall be recorded in the accounts in the manner stated hereunder. An adjustment of capitalization resulting in modification and reformation of classes of securities pursuant to voluntary action of the holders of securities but not resulting in a formal reorganization following a bankruptcy or other receivership proceedings (sometimes called a quasi-reorganization) is not covered by this instruction 2-16. Reduction of capital stock and other contributions to capital by stockholders shall be recorded in accordance with the instructions in the text of account 795, *Other capital.*

(b) The amounts includable in primary road and equipment property accounts shall be recorded at cost as shown in the predecessor companies' accounts except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this instruction 2-16. The remaining assets and the liabilities of the predecessor companies, adjusted as necessary to conform with the accounting rules of the Board, together with the balances in the accumulated amortization and depreciation accounts, shall be recorded in the appropriate balance sheet accounts.


(c) When the amount recorded for assets acquired is more than the par or stated value of no par capital stock issued and other consideration paid, including liabilities assumed, the difference shall be applied to such extent as necessary and is available to provide first for any deficiency in past accrued depreciation on property classified as depreciable; and, second, for any estimated loss from retirement of a branch line, segment of track or other important facility indicated by supporting records to be imminent. The remaining amount of the difference, if any, shall be applied proportionately to reduce the amounts includable in the property accounts in accordance with paragraph (b) of this instruction 2-16, based on the percentage relationship between such difference and the aggregate cost of the property shown in the predecessor companies' accounts.


(d) When the amount applicable to the assets acquired is less than the par or stated value of no par capital stock issued and other consideration paid, including liabilities assumed, the accounting shall be referred to the Board for consideration and decision.


2-17 *Construction projects in which governmental agencies, individuals, or others, and the carrier participate.* (a) The amount includible in the property account for construction projects in which the carrier and governmental agencies, individuals, or others participate shall be (1) the payment made by the carrier for its share of the cost of construction plus (2) the recorded cost (estimated if unknown) of property relinquished as a direct result of the arrangement and retired from service less the value of salvage recovered therefrom by the carrier and less depreciation accrued on depreciable property, which is part of the carrier's cost of the project. The amount so includable in the property account shall be distributed equitably among the primary accounts applicable to railway property constructed. This amount shall first be applied to railway facilities includable in accounts other than 4, *Other right-of-way expenditures,* or 39, *Public improvements—Construction,* then any remaining balance shall be included in account 4 or 39, as appropriate. In no case shall the amount included in the primary accounts for the railway facilities acquired exceed the actual cost of constructing such facilities. The property account shall not include any cost or value for facilities or land contributed or paid for by governmental agencies, individuals or others. Property acquired as a specific contribution to capital by stockholders does not come under this rule. (See text of account 795, *Other capital.*)


(b) Construction projects as used in this section means widening of highways, construction of spillways, drainage canals, farm and other private passes, pipelines, drains or other facilities across the right-of-way; construction of overhead highway bridges, and railroad bridges over public highways and across streams, which provide a railroad use in the operation of trains and a public use in the uninterrupted passage of highway and river traffic; installation of warning signals to protect highway traffic; and industrial side tracks. Also, reconstruction and relocation of tracks and appurtenant facilities such as occur in connection with carrying out flood control, reclamation, and other public improvement projects where it becomes necessary to abandon part of the line of railroad and relocate the tracks.


2-18 *Leased property improvements and retirements.* The cost to lessee of structures, facilities, additions and betterments on leased property and for retirement of property the cost of which is included in account 732 *Improvements on leased property,* shall be accounted for in conformity with the principles in the instructions for property owned. When lessor's property is retired and replaced and lessee is not obligated to reimburse the lessor for the retired property other than through the replacement, the lessee shall (1) charge the cost of the replacement to account 732, *Improvements on leased property,* (2) discontinue accruing depreciation for lessor's retired property, and (3) when recording final settlement with the lessor, consider jointly the amount accrued in account 772, *Accrued liability; Leased property,* for lessor's retired property and the respective amounts for the replacement included in accounts 732, *Improvements on leased property,* and 733, *Accumulated depreciation; Improvements on leased property.* When lessee is obligated to reimburse the lessor currently or at the termination of the lease for property retired other than through replacement, the lessee shall include the amount of the obligation in the appropriate liability account. The lessee shall furnish the lessor such information as is required to enable the lessor to perform necessary accounting. The accounting by the lessee and the lessor shall be consistent with contractual arrangements.


2-19 *List of units of property.* (a) This list of units is established for the purpose of designating the units of property to be used in accounting for additions to and retirements and replacements of property. Detailed information is included in instructions 2-7 and 2-8. Items listed under road property accounts are subject to the minimum rule applicable to additions to property. See instruction 2-2 pertaining to the minimum rule.


(b) This list of units will be revised from time to time as may be necessary to meet conditions. A carrier desiring to include in any account an appropriate unit not now specified therein may, upon approval of the Board, make such authorized addition to this list of units.


(c) Rules applicable to units of property rebuilt or converted and to changes in line of road or tracks which involve accounting for units or property retired are set forth in instructions 2-12 and 2-13.


2-20 *Accounting for leases.* (a) Leases shall be accounted for as capital leases whenever the lease meets one or more of the following four criteria:


(1) The lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by the end of the lease term,


(2) The lease contains a bargain purchase option,


(3) The lease term is equal to 75 percent or more of the estimated economic life of the property, and,


(4) The present value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum lease payments equals or exceeds 90 percent of the fair value of the leased property to the lessor at the inception of the lease less any related investment tax credit retained by the lessor.


(b) If the lease does not meet any of the four criteria, the lease shall be classified and accounted for as an operating lease.


(c) When accounting for capital leases the lessee shall record the asset and the related obligation. The amount recorded as the asset and the obligation shall be the present value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum lease payments during the lease term, excluding that portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor. However, if that amount exceeds the fair value of the leased property, the amount recorded as the asset and the obligation shall be the fair value. The lessee shall compute the present value of the minimum lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate unless (1) it is practicable to learn the implicit rate computed by the lessor and (2) the implicit rate computed by the lessor is less than the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. If both of those conditions are met, the lessee shall use the implicit rate.


(d) Leased assets that meet the criteria for classification as a capital lease shall be subject to depreciation over their useful lives in the same manner as assets owned. If the capital lease meets the criteria of either Instruction 2-20(a)(1) or 2-20(a)(2), the asset shall be amortized in a manner consistent with the lessee's normal depreciation policy for owned assets. If the lease does not meet either of these two criteria, the asset shall be amortized in a manner consistent with the lessee's normal depreciation policy except that the period of amortization shall be the lease term.


(e) The accounting accorded the lease shall be subject to the same considerations as other obligations in classifying them with current and noncurrent liabilities in the classified balance sheet. Leases that meet the criteria requiring capitalization shall be recorded in those accounts that provide for carrier operating property or property used in other than carrier operations, as appropriate. The accounts shall segregate the amounts pertaining to capital leases.


(f) If the lease qualifies as an operating lease it should be accounted for by charging the rent to expense over the lease term. The rental expense should be recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term unless another method is more representative of the use and the benefits derived.


(g) The criteria specified in paragraph (a) should be applied to all leases regardless of the relationship between the lessor and the lessee unless it is clear that the terms of the lease transaction have been significantly affected by their relationship. In this situation, the accounting should be modified to recognize economic substance rather than legal form.


(h) In the case of subsidiary companies or companies under common control whose principal business activity is leasing property or facilities to the carrier, the carrier is encouraged to request special authority to file consolidated or combined financial statements. If the carrier does not wish to file consolidated or combined financial statements, capitalization of the lease will be required if the lease meets the criteria that would require capitalization.


2-21 *Freight train car repair costing.* Class I railroads shall report the costs of repairing freight train cars by car types.


(a) The accounting for freight train car repair costs shall agree with the applicable instructions and texts of accounts in 49 CFR Part 1201 relating to the equipment repair process (see Note A).


(b) Railroads may assign either actual costs, standard costs, or a combination of both to the accounting process. Standard costs, if used, shall recognize the differences in performing repairs on various types of equipment, and the differences related to specific repair facilites. Standard costs shall be based on adequate operational data which are reviewed at least annually. The resulting variances (price, efficiency, capacity, etc.) shall be reasonably allocated back to the car types to derive the amounts reported in Form R-1.


(c) Railroads shall report repair costs by the freight train car types shown in Schedule 415 of Form R-1. In assigning repair costs, railroads may use either one of the following methodologies:


(1) The repair costs relating to heavy, program, or project repairs of freight train cars shall be directly assigned to the car types repaired by using actual or standard costs. A heavy repair is defined as a repair that is relatively so material in cost, repair time, or physical damage that management's involvement in the determination of the repair to be made is necessary and relatively greater than usual. Program or project repairs are those repairs which are performed under a predetermined plan where estimates costs, time periods, and car types to be repaired are identified.


(2) The repair costs relating to light and running repairs of system cars shall be allocated to the car types by using the Association of American Railroads' Car Repair Billing System (CRBS) as the process for distributing light and running repairs. The CRBS will be the tracking system for recording the number of repairs, the car types and types of repairs. Then by applying the CRBS standard costs to the particular repairs, standard costs relationships by car type can be developed and used to distribute actual light and running repair cost pools to the car types.


(3) Railroads shall match repair costs billed by and paid to foreign roads with the car types that were repaired. Foreign billings for light and running repairs are usually conducted through CRBS, and therefore, the car types can be identified. For heavy off-line repairs, car type identification is possible because system management is generally involved with the authorization of such heavy repairs and car identification numbers are generally included in the billing process.


(4) Repair costs relating to foreign freight train cars shall also be reported by car types. However, a separate breakdown between foreign and system repair costs is not required for Board reporting purpose. Car type identification for light and running repairs to foreign cars can be obtained from CRBS tapes. The cost of heavy repairs to foreign cars should be accumulated by car types. The resulting expense credits from foreign railroads should be assigned to the car types to which they relate.


(5) Railroads shall match any resulting expense credits with the car types to which they relate. This can occur, for example, when a railroad is charged with the repair costs of system cars, but the responsibility of the repair ultimately rests with and is paid by a foreign road.


(d) Railroads shall submit to the Board any repair cost by car type methodology which does not agree with item (c) above. The Board shall review the methodology and determine if it is acceptable for reporting purposes.


(e) Railroads may submit justification and supporting documents requesting waiver from provisions required by this instruction. This provision is intended to provide relief for those smaller Class I railroads that might be unduly burdened by the cost of developing and maintaining the required system. Waivers shall be directed to the Board's Accounting and Valuation Board.


(f) Equipment repair cost records, including the allocation methods used, shall be maintained and made available to the Board upon request.


2-22 *Map specifications.*

(a) Class I Railroad companies shall maintain current maps of its property and shall promptly record any changes that may take place.


(b) Class I companies shall furnish, on request, copies of maps showing its property as it exists on such date or dates as may be fixed by the Board.


(c) Class I companies shall maintain planimetric maps that show right-of-way, track and other important facilities at a scale to show sufficient detail.


(d) Maps shall be indexed and titled to clearly indicate the specific area depicted.


(e) All maps shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted mapping practices.


2-23 *Accounting for engineering costs.*

(a) The pay and expenses of engineers, assistants and clerks engaged in the survey and construction of new lines and extensions shall be included in the cost of the particular property involved. This accounting treatment also applies in making additions to and improvements of the carriers road, including wharves and docks.


(b) When employees listed in (a) above are engaged in the repair and maintenance of the roadway, their pay and expenses shall be charged to the appropriate operating expense accounts.


(c) Expenditures for tentative or preliminary surveys shall be carried in account 743, *Other deferred debits,* until it is determined whether or not to continue the work. If the project is continued, expenditures for all surveys shall be transferred to the appropriate property account and, if abandoned, to appropriate income accounts.


(d) The cost of designing, making plans and specificaitons, and supervising the construction of equipment shall be included in the cost of the particular equipment.


(e) Fees and expenses of architects specially employed for designing or supervising the construction of buildings shall be included in the accounts appropriate for the cost of the buildings constructed.


2-24 *Accounting for other general expenditures.*

Expenditures of a general nature that are attributable but not directly assignable to original construction or important expansion of road shall be equitably assigned to the cost of specific units or segments of property. These expenditures include the pay and expenses of executive and general officers and their assistants engaged exclusively with such construction, law expenses (other than organization expenses), stationery and printing, and taxes before property is used in transportation operations.


3-1 *Items to be charged.* (a) The accounts provided for maintenance of road property and of equipment are designed to show the cost of repairs and also the loss through depreciation of the property used in transportation operations, including expenses resulting from ordinary wear and tear of service, exposure to the elements, inadequacy, obsolesence, or other depreciation, or from accident, fire, flood, or other casualty.


(b) These accounts shall include the cost of labor, materials and supplies, work-train service, floating equipment work service, special machine service, contract work, privileges, protection from casualties, and other analogous items of expense in connection with the maintenance of the plant used in railway service. The cost of materials and supplies, which shall include small tools, shall include the cost at the point of free delivery plus freight charges of foreign lines, and the costs of inspection and loading assumed by the carrier; also a proportion of store expenses. Such costs shall not include expenses of transportation over the carrier's line. Royalties for patent rights on mechanical appliances used in repairs of equipment shall be included in the cost of the repairs. The cost of boarding, traveling, and other incidental expenses of employees shall be included in the accounts to which the pay of the employees is chargeable, except where otherwise specified in the text of the accounts. In calculating the cost of materials used proper allowance shall be made for the value of unused portions and of cuttings, turnings, borings, etc., and for the value of the material recovered from property repaired and from temporary tracks, scaffolding, cofferdams, and other temporary structures used in repair work.


(c) The cost of repairs shall include the cost of inspecting to determine the repairs necessary, and of adjusting or repairing parts, both of road property and of equipment, such as the repairing of locomotives, cars, frogs, switches, rails, etc.; the cost of inspecting and testing after repairs have been made such as the testing of locomotives after repairs to determine whether the repairs have been properly made, and the running of repaired locomotives light in order to break them in for regular service; incidental costs of repairs, such as the construction or removal of false work in connection with maintenance, cost of demolishing retired road property and disposing of the wreckage therefrom when the property is dismantled by or for the carrier; cost of maintaining or protecting traffic during the progress of construction work, including the cost of constructing, maintaining and removing temporary tracks required for maintaining traffic during the progress of the work; cost of mowing and beautifying grounds around buildings; repairing fences, sidewalks, driveways, and streets within or adjacent to such grounds; cost of removing snow from roofs of buildings (when not removed by those employed in the buildings); cost of periodical restorations of seasonal features, such as gardens, shrubbery, and lawns; cost of operating hothouses in connection with the work of beautifying grounds; and cost of clearing and removing casual incumbrances, such as ice, snow, and fallen timber.


(d) An employee's job classification shall not govern the accounting for work performed. Charges to a particular expense function shall be based on the nature of the work performed.


4-1 *Method.* (a) There shall be charged monthly to operating expenses or other appropriate accounts and credited to account 735, *Accumulated depreciation; Road and equipment property,* during the service life of depreciable road and equipment property, includable in accounts classed as depreciable, amounts which will approximate the loss in service value not restored by current repairs or covered by insurance. The charges for accruing depreciation currently shall be computed in conformity with the group plan by applying to the cost of property such percentage rates as will distribute the service value by the straight-line method in equal annual charges to operating expenses or other accounts during the estimated life of the property. In the case of track accounts 8, 9 and 11, service value shall reflect net salvage value. For road property, the cost shall be original cost or estimated original cost, as used in the valuation records, adjusted to current date. If a carrier submits proof that the actual cost of depreciable property is substantially different from cost figures in the valuation records, the carrier may, with the approval of the Board, use such cost figures as the depreciation base.


(b) The term group plan means the plan under which depreciation charges are accrued upon the basis of the cost of depreciable property includable in accounts classed as depreciable using the service lives of the individual depreciable units in the accounts and properly weighing to determine the composite annual rate of depreciation.


(c) For the purpose of the group plan of depreciation accounting, the following primary accounts are classed as depreciable accounts:


(d) When abandonment of a branch line or other important segment of the track structure or other part of the plant for which depreciation charges are not includable in the accounts as foreseeable within a reasonable period of time due to exhaustion of traffic, obsolescence or other causes, application may be made to the Board for authority to record a suitable provision in anticipation of a probable loss.


4-2 *Rates of depreciation.* (a) A separate composite annual percentage rate for each depreciable property account, or a subgroup in that account, shall be used in computing annual depreciation expenses and accumulated depreciation. The composite rates shall be based on the results of a depreciation study performed by each railroad. A depreciation study shall, in general, contain the following components:


(i) Actuarial or semiactuarial methods for determining service lives for road and equipment properties;


(ii) Salvage value calculations for road and equipment properties;


(iii) Accumulated depreciation for each account or subaccount as appropriate;


(iv) Other factors and related calculations involving the depreciation process; and


(v) A commentary on any adjustments and judgmental factors used in the study.


(b) Railroads shall submit to the Board for review and approval a report on depreciation studies and proposed depreciation rates every three years for equipment property, and every six years for road property. Railroads can, however, submit depreciation studies prior to its scheduled year, in which case a new cycle will begin.


(c) In computing monthly depreciation charges, the annual percentage rates shall be applied to the depreciation base as of the first of each month and the results shall be divided by twelve.


(d) Class II railroads are exempt from the three-year and six-year cyclical reviews, but shall submit depreciation studies when requested by the Board. Class III railroads are not required to submit depreciation studies.


(e) A separate track depreciation rate shall apply to each primary property account in each track density category as provided in Instruction 4-3(d). Track depreciation rates shall be developed by estimating the average life based on an acceptable depreciation methodology, consistently applied, including as an option the units of production method based on gross ton-miles per mile of track.


4-3 *Depreciation records to be kept.* (a) The carrier shall maintain for each class of property in convenient and accessible form engineering and other data bearing on prospective service lives.


(b) The carrier also shall keep such records of depreciable property and property retirements as will reflect the service life of each class of property which has been retired, or will permit the determination of service life indications by past experience of useful life tenure of comparable property, turnover, or other appropriate methods; also such records as will reflect the percentage of value of the salvage for property retired from each class of depreciable property.


(c) For purposes of analysis the carrier shall maintain subsidiary records in which the accumulated depreciation account is broken down into component parts corresponding to each primary account to show the current credits and debits and the balance for each account. Such detailed information shall be reported annually to this Board. For balance sheet purposes, the accumulated depreciation account shall be treated as a single composite account for depreciable property.


(d) Carriers shall be prepared to justify all track depreciation rates by keeping appropriate data on the service lives and salvage values of track components which went into the life and net salvage computation of each primary account in each density category.


(e) The investment and related accumulated depreciation for accounts 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 39 must be maintained by distinct traffic density categories. Each line segment shall be identified on January 1 of each year as belonging to one of the following traffic density classes, based on the average traffic density in the preceding three years:

Density


4-4 *Leased property—depreciation.* (a) The carrier shall include in operating expenses charges for depreciation on road property and equipment used but not owned, the rent for which is includable in the lease rental accounts, and shall maintain the same records of service lives, salvage values, etc., as provided for owned road property and equipment. The excess of the total compensation paid over the amount chargeable for depreciation shall be included in the rent account. If settlement between the carrier and the lessor is not currently made, the amount of the depreciation accrued during the period of the lease shall be credited by the carrier to account 772. *Accrued liability; Leased property.* The necessary adjustments of the difference between the balance thus accrued in that account and the actual amount of settlement shall be made appropriately through accounts 519, *Miscellaneous income,* or 551, *Miscellaneous income charges,* at the time settlement for depreciation on the property is made with the lessor.


(b) The carrier shall not include in the depreciation account in operating expenses any charges for depreciation of equipment used but not owned when the rents therefor are not included in the lease rental accounts but shall include such charges in the appropriate other rent expense accounts.


4-5 *Jointly used property—depreciation.* The owning carrier shall include in the depreciation accounts in operating expenses the charges for depreciation on units of depreciable property jointly used with one or more other carriers. The owning carrier shall credit and each using carrier shall charge the appropriate joint facility accounts in operating expenses with the amounts billed by the owning carrier against each using carrier for its proportion of the service loss on property retired from service whether billed currently as depreciation or when retirements occur as the loss in service value. The using carriers shall be required to account for depreciation or retirement of units of road property jointly used but not owned to the extent of their contract liability. The same principle shall apply to terminal companies and their nonowner tenants in accounting for depreciation accruals or retirement charges recorded in the accounts of the terminal companies.



5-1 *Current assets.* (a) In the group of accounts designated as current assets shall be included cash, those assets which are readily convertible into cash or are held for current use in operations, current claims against others and amounts accruing to the carrier which are subject to settlement in the ordinary course of business within one year. There shall not be included in this group of accounts any amount the collection of which is not reasonably assured within one year because of the known financial conditions of the debtor or otherwise. Such items shall be included in account 741, *Other assets,* at an amount not in excess of a reasonable estimate of realizable value. Items of current character but of doubtful value shall be written down or written off by charge to account 63-61-00, *General—Uncollectible accounts—General and administrative,* or account 553, *Uncollectible accounts,* as appropriate. Adjustment of these items of doubtful value shall be made by direct reduction of the asset account in which such items are carried or by provision in account 709.5, *Allowance for uncollectible accounts,* for the estimated uncollectible amount.


(b) The carrier shall transfer the estimated realizable value of obsolete material to account 741, *Other assets,* equitably distribute the loss due to obsolescence among the accounts ordinarily chargeable for such classes of material, and concurrently credit account 712, *Material and Supplies.*

5-2 *Recorded value of securities owned.* (a)(1) The investment in securities other than those issued or assumed by the accounting company shall be recorded in these accounts at cost, but excluding amounts paid for accrued interest and accrued dividends.


(2) Account 702, *Temporary cash investments,* account 721, *Investments and advances; affiliated companies,* and account 722, *Other investments and advances,* shall be maintained in such a manner as to reflect the marketable equity portion (see definition 26) and other securities or investments.


(3) For the purpose of determining net ledger value, the marketable equity securities in account 702 shall be considered the current portfolio and the marketable equity securities in accounts 721 and 722 (combined) shall be considered the noncurrent portfolio.


(4) Carriers will categorize their security investments as held-to-maturity, trading, or available-for-sale. Unrealized holding gains and losses on trading type investment securities will be recorded in account 551, *Miscellaneous income charges.* Unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale type investment securities will be recorded in account 799.1, *Other comprehensive income.*

(5) If there is a change in the classification of a marketable equity security between current and noncurrent, the security shall be transferred at the lower of its cost or market value at date of transfer. If market value is less than cost, the market value shall become the new cost basis, and the difference shall be accounted for as if it were a realized loss and included in the determination of net income.


(6) The accounting company shall write down the ledger value of any securities to the extent of impairment in their value or write off entirely if there is no reasonable prospect of realizing any value therefrom. For long term investments in marketable equity securities, when the decline in market value below cost is judged to be other than temporary, the cost basis of the individual security shall be writen down to a new cost basis. The amount of the write-down shall be accounted for as realized loss by a charge to account 551, *Other Income Charges,* and a credit to account 723, *Reserve for Adjustment of Investment in Securities.* The new cost basis shall not be changed for subsequent recoveries in value.


(b)(1) For financial statement purposes the carrier shall follow the principles of equity accounting for (1) all investments in corporate joint ventures (see definition 21(c)), and (2) all investments in voting stock of affiliated companies giving the carrier the ability to significantly influence the operating and financial policies of an investee (see definition 21(b)). For purposes of this instruction an investment of 20 percent or more of the outstanding voting stock of an investee will indicate the ability to exercise significant influence over an investee in the absence of evidence to the contrary.


(2) Since the equity method is not to be effected by entries in the books of accounts but is to apply only in financial reports to the Board, the carrier shall establish worksheet or memorandum accounts. Three basic worksheet or memorandum accounts are needed:


(i) An investment account to include (1) equity in the undistributed earnings or losses of the investee since the date of acquisition (see definition 21(g)); (2) accumulated amortization of the difference between cost and net assets at date of acquisition (see (b)(3) below); and other adjustments for disposition or writedown of investments.


(ii) An income account to include (1) the investor's share of the investee's undistributed profits or losses for each reporting period subsequent to acquisition of the investment except that in the year of acquisition such amount shall be determined from the date of acquisition; (2) amortization for the reporting period of the difference between cost and net assets at date of acquisition. This account shall be closed at year-end to the retained earnings memorandum account discussed in paragraph (iii) below.


(iii) A retained earnings account to include (1) equity in the undistributed earnings or losses of the investee since the date of acquisition; (2) accumulated amortization of the difference between cost and net assets acquired at date of acquisition (see (b)(3) below).


(iv) Other memorandum accounts will be needed for such adjustments as gains and losses on disposition of investments, recognition of impairments in value, the investor's share of extraordinary and prior period adjustments reported in the investee's financial statements (see instruction 1-2(d)), and provision for deferred taxes where it is reasonable to assume that undistributed earnings of an investee will be transferred to the investor in a taxable distribution. These memorandum accounts shall be closed at year-end to the retained earnings memorandum account discussed in paragraph (iii) above.


(3) The carrier shall retain the following information for each investee in support of the worksheet or memorandum accounts:


(i) Original cost of investment.


(ii) Equity in net assets of investee at date of acquisition.


(iii) Allocation of difference between cost and equity in net assets, namely, to specific assets of investee or to goodwill.


(iv) Accumulated amortization of difference between cost and equity in net assets.


(v) Unamortized balance of difference between cost and equity in net assets.


(vi) Equity in undistributed earnings/losses for each year since date of acquisition.


(vii) Dividends received since date of acquisition if determinable.


(viii) Proceeds from sale of investments.


(4) Any difference between the investor's cost and its share of the net assets of the investee at date of acquisition shall be allocated to specific assets of the investee to the extent the difference is attributable to them. When the difference is allocated to depreciable or amortizable assets, depreciation and amortization (through the investment and income memorandum accounts) should absorb the difference over the remaining life of the related assets. If the difference is not related to specific accounts, it should be considered goodwill and amortized over a reasonable period not to exceed 40 years. For investments made prior to November 1, 1970, amortization of goodwill is not required in the absence of evidence that the goodwill has a limited term of existence.


(5) The financial statements of the investee that are used for equity accounting should be timely. If the accounting year of the investee differs from that of the investor then the most recent available financial statements may be used. The lag in reporting should be consistent from period to period.


(6) Material profits or losses on transactions between the investor and investee shall be eliminated until realized by either company as if the two were consolidated.


(7) A transaction of the investee of a capital nature that affects the investor's share of the investee's stockholder's equity should be reported in the financial statements as if the two were consolidated.


(8) The investor shall deduct any dividends applicable to outstanding cumulative preferred stock whether or not declared, and any other dividends declared when computing its share of undistributed earnings or losses.


(9) The investor shall suspend application of the equity method when the investment (including the investment memorandum account) together with any net advances made to the investee is reduced to zero. Additional losses shall not be provided for unless the investor has guaranteed obligations of the investee or is otherwise committed to provide further financial support for the investee. If the investee subsequently reports net income the investor shall resume applying the equity method at such time as its share of that net income equals the share of net losses not recognized during the period of suspension.


(10) When the investor's voting stock interest falls below the level of ownership described in paragraph (b)(1) of this instruction, the investment no longer qualifies for the equity method. Should dividends received on the investment in subsequent periods exceed the investor's share of earnings for such periods, the investment memorandum and income memorandum accounts shall be reduced by the excess amount.


(11) When the level of ownership of an investment increases to that described in paragraph (b)(1) of this instruction, the equity method shall be applied. The memorandum accounts for the investment, income (for current year's equity in undistributed earnings less amoritzation), and retained earnings (for prior years' equity in undistributed earnings less amortization) shall be adjusted retroactively on a step-by-step basis determining the equity in net assets at date of acquisition, amortization adjustment, and equity in undistributed earnings or losses at each level of ownership. Where small purchases are made over a period of time and then a purhase is made which qualifies the investment for the equity method, the date of latest purchase may be used as date of acquisition.


(12) Information having significance with respect to the investor's ownership in investees shall be disclosed in notes to financial statements of annual reports filed with the Board in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.


(c) When securities with a fixed maturity date are purchased at a discount (i.e., when total cost including brokerage fees, taxes, commissions, etc., is less than par), such discounts may be amortized over the remaining life of the securities through periodic debits to the account in which the securities are carried (preferably coincident with entries recording interest accruals) and credits to the same account in which interest income is credited. No debits shall be made in respect to discounts upon securities held as investments or in special funds if there is reason to believe that such securities will be disposed of by redemption or otherwise at less than par or will not be paid at date of maturity. When securities with a fixed maturity date are purchased at a premium (i.e., when the total cost including brokerage fees, taxes, commissions, etc., is in excess of par), such premium may be amortized over the remaining life of the securities through periodic credits to the account in which the securities are carried (preferably coincident with entries recording interest accruals) and debits to the same accounts in which the interest income is recorded.


5-3 *Discounts, expenses, and premiums on debt.* (a) Ledger accounts shall be provided to cover the discounts, expenses, and premiums on the sale or resale of each subclass of funded debt and of receivers' and trustees' securities issued for the benefit of or assumed by the company. (For explanation of *subclass* see account 765, *Funded debt unmatured.*) The net debit balances remaining in the ledger accounts for discount and premium shall be included in account 770.1, *Unamortized debt discount,* and the net credit balances in account 770.2, *Unamortized premium on debt.* Debt expense shall be included in account 743, *Other deferred debits.*

(b) Each fiscal period there shall be charged to account 548, *Amortization of discount on funded debt,* a proportion on a consistent basis of each of the debit balances in the discount and premium accounts and correspondingly there shall be credited to income account 517, *Release of premiums on funding debt,* a similar proportion of each of the credit balances in these accounts. Related debt expense shall also be charged to account 548 on a proportional and consistent basis. The amounts for the respective debit balances for discount and expenses applicable to a particular issue of obligations may be charged directly to account 548 at time of issue when the aggregate of such amounts does not appreciably affect the accounts. The method of apportioning debt discount, issue costs, and premium to accounts 517 and 548 shall be the *interest method,* where the effective interest rate on the date of issuance is applied to the carrying value (debt, less related discount, and issue cost, plus related premium of each specific issue to the beginning of any given period.) However, other methods of amortization may be used if the results obtained are not materially different from those which would result from the interest method.


(c) When any funded debt which has been actually issued to bona fide holders for value is reacquired by the accounting company, that proportion of the balance remaining in accounts containing discount, expense and premium on funded debt for the subclass of the security reacquired applicable to the portion reacquired shall be credited or charged thereto, as appropriate, and concurrently charged or credited to account 519, *Miscellaneous income,* account 551, *Miscellaneous income charges*; or to account 570, *Extraordinary items,* as appropriate, in accordance with the text of these accounts. Such proportion shall be based upon the ratio of the par value of the security reacquired to the par value of all the securities of the subclass actually outstanding immediately before such reacquirement. Gains and losses from extinguishment of debt (excluding debt maturing serially) which is acquired to satisfy sinking fund requirements, shall not be recorded as extraordinary items regardless of amount, but shall be included in accounts 519 and 551, as appropriate. Such gains and losses shall be separately disclosed in reports to this Board.


5-4 *Discount, premium, and assessment on capital stock.* (a) Separate ledger accounts shall be provided for each subclass of capital stock issued or assumed by the accounting company to cover discount suffered and premium realized at the time of sale of capital stock. General levies or assessments against stockholders shall be credited to the appropriate ledger accounts for the subclass of capital stock against which the levy or assessment is made.


(b) The total of net debit balance in these ledger accounts shall be included in account 793, *Discount on capital stock,* and the total of net credit balances in account 794, *Premiums and assessments on capital stock.*

(c) Discount on each subclass of capital stock may be offset or reduced by charges to account 794, *Premiums and assessments on capital stock,* to the extent that net gains from premiums or assessments have been included therein or to account 795, *Other capital,* to the extent that net gains from reacquisition and resale or retirement of capital stock applicable to such subclass have been included therein. Any remaining discount may be amortized by charge to account 616. *Other debits to retained earnings,* or may be retained and carried in account 793, *Discount on capital stock,* until the stock to which the discount applies is retired.


(d) In case the accounting company is permitted and elects with the approval of the Board, to distribute all or any part of the net balance of other paid-in capital to its stockholders, the amount thus distributed shall be charged to account 795, *Other capital.*

(e) When capital stock is reacquired, either by purchase or donation, and is retired or cancelled, account 791, *Capital stock,* shall be charged with the par value, stated value of no par stock, or if no par stock without stated value, the proportionate amount at which the particular class of stock is included in account 791. Any excess of reacquisition cost over the recorded value of the stock shall be charged to account 795, *Other capital,* to the extent of the accumulated net gains included in this account applicable to reacquisition and resale or retirement of such subclass. Any remaining excess reacquisition cost shall be charged to account 616, *Other debits to retained earnings.* Any excess of recorded value over reaquisition cost shall be credited to account 795, *Other capital.*

(f) When capital stock is reacquired, either by purchase or donation, and is not retired or cancelled, nor properly includable in sinking or other funds, the reacquisition cost shall be charged to account 798.5, *Treasury stock.*

(g) When treasury stock is resold, account 798.5, *Treasury stock,* shall be credited with the cost paid for it. Gains shall be credited to account 795, ‘Other capital.’ Losses shall be charged to account 795, *Other capital,* to the extent that previous net gains from sales or retirements of the same class of stock are included therein; otherwise, to account 616, *Other debits to retained earnings.*

5-5 *Joint liabilities.* The accounting company shall state as a liability in its balance sheet the difference between the total par value of securities jointly or severally issued by it and others and the portion of such liability which, under the joint arrangement, it is expected will be liquidated by the other party or parties to the joint arrangement. The amount of the jointly or severally issued securities expected to be liquidated by the other party or parties shall be shown as a contingent liability in accordance with instruction 5-6 pertaining to contingent assets and liabilities.


5-6 *Contingencies.* (a) The proper accounting treatment for contingencies depends upon whether the contingency is: *Probable:* the event or events are likely to occur; *Reasonably possible:* the chance of occurrence of the future event or events is more than remote, but less than likely; or *Remote:* the chance of occurrence of the future event or events is slight.


(b) Loss contingencies must be accrued when they are probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Where they are only reasonably possible, only footnote disclosure is required. Where they are remote, footnote disclosure is not required, but is permitted.


(c) Gain contingencies usually are not reflected in the accounts since to do so might be to recognize revenue prior to its realization. Adequate disclosure shall be made of contingencies that might result in gain, but care shall be exercised to avoid misleading implications as to the likelihood of realization.


5-7 *Long-term obligations.* Commitments under unconditional purchase obligations associated with suppliers' financing arrangements and future payments on long-term borrowings and redeemable stock shall be disclosed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Such disclosures shall not preclude accounting recognition if the substance of a financing arrangement is the acquisition of an asset or incurrence of a liability.


6-1 *Items to be charged.* In recognition of the fact that certain expenditures incident to the construction and the operation of property are not chargeable directly to any particular property investment or expense account, clearing accounts have been provided for the purpose of securing an equitable distribution of such items to the proper primary accounts.


6-2 *Material and stationery store expenses.* (a) To clearing accounts called *Material store expenses* and *Stationery store expenses* shall be charged expenses in connection with purchasing, handling and storing material and stationery in and distributing it from the company's storehouses. Including the pay of officers and employees in the purchasing and store departments and their traveling, office, and other expenses; also expenses, including wages, fuel, and supplies, of operating switching locomotives when exclusively assigned to the service of switching at material storehouses. (Expenses of incidental switching at material yards by locomotives in regular switching service shall be charged to the appropriate transportation accounts.) The pay and expenses of men employed in purchasing or inspecting a single class of material, such as ties, shall be added as store expenses to the cost of that particular material.


(b) The total amount of storehouse expenses charged to these accounts shall be distributed among the accounts to which material and stationery has been charged, in proportion to the amounts charged to each account for the items issued, except that the amount representing the purchasing department expenses shall be apportioned on the value of the items issued which were purchased by that department. To avoid monthly fluctuations in the ratio of store expenses to the value of material and stationery purchased or issued, carriers may make a monthly apportionment on the basis of fair percentage rates, provided the store expense accounts are adjusted and closed out at the end of each year.


6-3 *Shop expenses.* (a) To a clearing account entitled *Shop expenses* shall be charged items of expense at shops, enginehouses, repair tracks, and other places where mechanical work is performed, not assignable directly to specific accounts. Such expenses shall be apportioned among the various accounts affected. The basis of distribution shall be the relative proportion which the total amount of charges to *Shop expenses* bears to the total of the directly distributed labor. To avoid monthly fluctuations in the ratio of shop expenses to the total of distributed labor, carriers are permitted to make the monthly apportionment on the basis of a percentage of the distributed labor, provided the shop expense account is adjusted and closed out at the end of the year.
