# Subpart Bâ€”Branch Line Accounting System



Unless otherwise required by context, the following definitions apply in this subpart:


*Account* means an account in the STB's Uniform System of Accounts (USOA), for Railroad companies (49 CFR Part 1201, Subpart A).


*IC Act* means the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C. 1 *et seq.*), as amended.


*Branch Line* or *Branch* means a rail line or segment of line which (a) has been designated on a transportation system diagram in categories (1), (2), (3), or (4) (49 CFR 1152.10(b) (1), (2), (3), (4)); or (b) is the subject of a directed service order under section 304(d)(3) of the 3R Act; or (c) is the subject of a rail continuation service agreement entered into prior to the designation of the line on a system diagram.


*STB* or *Board* means the Surface Transportation Board.


*Designated State agency* means the instrumentality created by a State or designated by appropriate authority to administer or coordinate its State rail plan as required by section 5(j)(2) of the Department of Transportation Act (90 Stat. 131) or section 402(c)(1)(A) of the 3R Act (87 Stat. 985) or regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.


*Railroad* means a common carrier by railroad, as defined in section 1(3) of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C. 1(3)).


*3R Act* means the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, Pub. L. 93-236, 87 Stat. 985, as amended.


*4R Act* means the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976, Pub. L. 94-210, 90 Stat. 31.


*XX,* when used in place of digits in a six-digit account number, means that all accounts containing the remaining four-digits are included. Example: *11-21-XX* refers to all salary and wage accounts for locomotives because *11* designates salaries and wages and *21* designates locomotives. Thus, *11-21-XX* includes all of the following accounts: 11-21-01; 11-21-40; 11-21-48; 11-21-39; and 11-21-99. Similarly, *XX-31-67* means all accounts containing *31* (train operations) and *67* (locomotive fuel).


Section 205(e)(1)(A) of the 3R Act directs the office to issue regulations which will permit the collection and publication by the Consolidated Rail Corp. (ConRail), or by profitable railroads of information necessary to determine accurately the revenues attributable, avoidable costs, and service units of light-density lines scheduled for abandonment. This accurate information is intended to facilitate the determination of the revenues and avoidable costs in abandonment proceedings and in potential offers of subsidy. This information is intended to be compatible with the Regional Subsidy Standards, for those lines which were not conveyed to ConRail under the final system plan and with the National Subsidy Standards (49 CFR Part 1152, Subpart D), for all other lines. The purpose of the Branch Line Accounting System regulations is to specify an accounting system for the collection and publication of this information.


(a) *Lines for which data collection is required.* The railroad shall collect data on all branch lines which meet the criteria listed in paragraphs 1 through 4 below. The data to be collected are specified in section 920(b).


(1) Branch lines in categories (1), (2), and (3) on the System Diagram Map include, respectively, lines for which a carrier intends to file an abandonment application within three years, lines which the carrier has under study and are potentially subject to abandonment, and lines for which an abandonment application is pending before the Board. The collection of data on such lines shall commence on the first day of the month after the line has been designated in one of the categories and will continue so long as the branch line is retained in one of these categories. The assignment and apportionment methodology set forth in Part 1152, Subchapter B (National Subsidy Standards), shall be applied.


(2) For branch lines operated under an order directing service, under section 304(d)(3) of the 3R Act, data shall be collected from the effective date of the order until the order is withdrawn. 


(3) For branch lines operated under a rail service continuation agreement under section 1a(6)(a) of the IC Act, data shall be collected from the effective date of the agreement until the termination of the agreement. The assignment and apportionment methodology set forth in Part 1152, Subchapter B (National Subsidy Standards), shall be applied.


(4) For branch lines operated under a rail service continuation agreement under section 304 of the 3R Act, data collection shall commence on the effective date of the agreement and shall continue until the termination date of the agreement. 


(b) *Data to be collected.* The data collected shall include the items of revenue, expense, and service units which are specified in 49 CFR 1152, as described in the account texts listed in section 950. The format for presentation of these data is specified in section 940.


(a) *General.* The railroad shall file on or before June 30 of each calendar year the certification included in these regulations as Appendix I. The railroad shall include a description of each branch line using the format set forth in Appendix I of these regulations. The description of each branch line requires the same data as that submitted under 49 CFR 1152.11. This section prescribes the branch line information required in conjunction with the system diagram maps specifying the line's designation, states and counties traversed, delineation of mileposts, and location of agency and terminal stations.


(b) [Reserved]


(c) *Access to records.* The records, accounts, working papers, and other documents reflecting the revenues, cost, and service unit data of each branch line for which the railroad must maintain data shall be made available for inspection and examination by the Board and, for lines situated within its State, by the designated State agency at a time and place mutually agreeable to the parties. The railroad shall also reproduce such records for the designated State agency, provided the agency pays the reasonable cost thereof.


(d) *Waivers and modifications.* The STB's Office of Economics may, with respect to individual requests, upon good cause shown, waive or modify any requirement of this section not required by law.


This section specifies the format in which the data collected for each branch line shall be maintained. Definitions of each account are presented in section 950.
