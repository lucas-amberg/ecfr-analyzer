# § 1245.3   Employees; definition, service hours, and compensation.

(a) *Definition of “employees”.* The word *employees,* as used in this part, is intended to include every person in the service of the reporting carrier subject to its continuing authority to supervise and direct the manner of rendition of his service. Persons engaged to render only specifically defined service and not subject to the continuing authority of the carrier to supervise and control their acts, such as customhouse brokers, lawyers retained only for specific cases and not under general or continuing retainer, etc., are not employees in the meaning of the term used in this part.


(b) *Counting employees.* Since the number of employees fluctuates, carriers are required to classify and count all of their employees at twelve different times each year.


(c) *Joint employees.* Each person jointly employed shall, if carried on the payrolls of the several joint employers, be counted by each employer and represented in its return of number of employees by a fraction based on the number of employers reporting him; if a person, for example, is reportable by three employers, each should include him in its number of employees as one-third of an employee. When the entire compensation of a joint employee is shown on the payroll of a single joint employer and is paid to the employee by that employer such employee should, for the purpose of returns, be treated as if employed solely by such employer.


(d) *Service hours.* (1) The number of hours on duty, or held for duty, and the number of hours paid for are to be ascertained and recorded for every class of employee. For enginemen and trainmen, the actual number of miles run and miles paid for but not run are to be recorded, as well as the number of hours on duty and the number of hours paid for. (The service time of all classes of employees shall be recorded in hours instead of days or hours as heretofore.)


(2) Whenever an employee works at more than one occupation, or in more than one class of service, both the number of hours worked and the compensation paid, should be separated and reported under the proper Reporting Divisions.


(3) If an employee is paid a day's wage for a smaller number of hours than constitutes a day's work, the number of hours paid for as well as the actual number of hours the employee is on duty should be ascertained and recorded. Time allowed for meals, part holidays, holidays, absences on leave, vacations, etc., should be excluded from time actually worked, but if such time is paid for it should be appropriately reported as “Time paid for but not worked” on Form A or as a “constructive allowance” on Form B. These requirements apply to enginemen and trainmen paid on the basis of trips or of miles run, and to employees paid at piece rates, as well as to employees paid on hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or other time basis. Service hours for officers and employees who do not receive payment for overtime should be reported as the number of hours in each month at 8 hours per day contemplated for the position.


(e) *Compensation.* The compensation of employees as defined in the rules in this part is to be stated in such manner and detail as the forms adopted for periodical returns require.
