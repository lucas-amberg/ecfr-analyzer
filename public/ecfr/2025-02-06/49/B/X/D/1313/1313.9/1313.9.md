# ยง 1313.9   Grounds for complaints and contract review.

(a) A complaint may be filed against a contract covered by this part:


(1) By any shipper on the ground that such shipper individually will be harmed because the contract unduly impairs the ability of the contracting rail carrier or carriers to meet their common carrier obligations to the complainant under 49 U.S.C. 11101;


(2) By a port on the ground that such port individually will be harmed because the contract will result in unreasonable discrimination against such port; and


(3) By a shipper of agricultural commodities on the ground that such shipper individually will be harmed because:


(i) The rail carrier has unreasonably discriminated by refusing to enter into a contract with such shipper for rates and services for the transportation of the same type of commodity under similar conditions to the contract at issue, and that such shipper was ready, willing, and able to enter into such a contract at a time essentially contemporaneous with the period during which the contract at issue was offered; or


(ii) The contract constitutes a destructive competitive practice.


(b) *Unreasonable discrimination,* for purposes of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, has the same meaning as the term has under 49 U.S.C. 10741.
