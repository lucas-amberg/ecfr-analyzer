# § 1503.3   Reports by the public of security problems, deficiencies, and vulnerabilities.

This section prescribes the reporting mechanisms that persons may use in order to obtain a receipt for reports to TSA regarding transportation-related security problems, deficiencies, and vulnerabilities.


(a) Any person who reports to TSA a transportation security-related problem, deficiency, or vulnerability—including the security of aviation, commercial motor vehicle, maritime, pipeline, any mode of public transportation, or railroad transportation—will receive a receipt for their report if they provide valid contact information and report through one of the following:


(1) U.S. mail to Transportation Security Administration HQ, TSA-2; Attn: 49 CFR 1503.3 Reports; 601 South 12th Street; Arlington, VA 20598-6002;


(2) Internet at *http://www.tsa.gov/contact,* selecting “Security Issues”; or


(3) Telephone (toll-free) at 1-866-289-9673.


(b) Reports submitted by mail will receive a receipt through the mail, reports submitted by the Internet will receive an e-mail receipt, and reports submitted by phone will receive a call identifier number linked to TSA documents held according to published record schedules. To obtain a paper copy of reports provided by phone, the person who made the report, or their authorized representative, must contact TSA at the address identified in (a)(1) of this section within that period and provide the identifier number.


(c) TSA will review and consider the information provided in any report submitted under this section and take appropriate steps to address any problems, deficiencies, or vulnerabilities identified.


(d) Nothing in this section relieves a person of a separate obligation to report information to TSA under another provision of this title, a security program, or a security directive, or to another Government agency under other law.


(e) Immediate or emergency security or safety concerns should be reported to the appropriate local emergency services operator, such as by telephoning 911. Alleged waste, fraud, and abuse in TSA programs should be reported to the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General: telephone (toll-free) 1-800-323-8603, or e-mail *DHSOIGHOTLINE@dhs.gov.*
