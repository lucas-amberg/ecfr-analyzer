# § 1503.427   Request for a formal hearing.

(a) *General.* Any respondent may request a formal hearing, pursuant to § 1503.413(c)(3) or § 1503.421(c)(3), to be conducted in accordance with the procedures in subpart G of this part. The filing of a request for a formal hearing does not guarantee a person an opportunity to appear before an ALJ in person, because the ALJ may issue an initial decision or dispositive order resolving the case prior to the commencement of the formal hearing.


(b) *Form.* The person submitting a request for hearing must date and sign the request, and must include his or her current address. The request for hearing must be typewritten or legibly handwritten.


(c) *Submission of request.* A person requesting a hearing must file a written request for a hearing with the Enforcement Docket Clerk in accordance with § 1503.429 and must serve a copy of the request on the agency attorney or other agency official who issued the Notice of Proposed Civil Penalty, or Notice of Violation, as applicable, and any other party, in accordance with § 1503.429.
