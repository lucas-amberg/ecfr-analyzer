# ยง 1503.611   Answer.

(a) *Filing.* A respondent must file a written answer to the complaint in accordance with ยง 1503.429, or may file a written motion pursuant to ยง 1503.629(f)(1)-(4) instead of filing an answer, not later than 30 days after service of the complaint. Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, the answer may be in the form of a letter, but must be dated and signed by the person responding to the complaint. An answer may be typewritten or may be legibly handwritten. The person filing an answer should suggest a location for the hearing when filing the answer.


(b) *Contents.* An answer must specifically state any affirmative defense that the respondent intends to assert at the hearing. A person filing an answer may include a brief statement of any relief requested in the answer.


(c) *Specific denial of allegations required.* A person filing an answer must admit, deny, or state that the person is without sufficient knowledge or information to admit or deny, each numbered paragraph of the complaint. Any statement or allegation contained in the complaint that is not specifically denied in the answer may be deemed an admission of the truth of that allegation. A general denial of the complaint is deemed a failure to file an answer.


(d) *Failure to file answer.* A person's failure to file an answer without good cause, as determined by the ALJ, will be deemed an admission of the truth of each allegation contained in the complaint.
