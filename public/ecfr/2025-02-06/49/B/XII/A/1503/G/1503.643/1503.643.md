# ยง 1503.643   Public disclosure of evidence.

This section applies to information other than Sensitive Security Information (SSI). All release of SSI is governed by ยง 1503.415 and 49 CFR part 1520.


(a) The ALJ may order that any other information contained in the record be withheld from public disclosure. Any person may object to disclosure of information in the record by filing a written motion to withhold specific information with the ALJ and serving a copy of the motion on each party. The party must state the specific grounds for nondisclosure in the motion.


(b) The ALJ must grant the motion to withhold information in the record if, based on the motion and any response to the motion, the ALJ determines that disclosure would be detrimental to transportation safety, disclosure would not be in the public interest, or that the information is not otherwise required to be made available to the public.
