# § 1511.5   Imposition of Aviation Security Infrastructure Fees.

(a) Effective February 18, 2002, an Aviation Security Infrastructure Fee will be imposed on air carriers and foreign air carriers engaged in air transportation. 


(b) The amount of the Aviation Security Infrastructure Fee for each fiscal year will not exceed, in the aggregate, the amounts paid in calendar year 2000 by air carriers and foreign air carriers for the screening of passengers and property transported by passenger aircraft in the United States, as determined by the Administrator. 


(c) For fiscal years 2002, 2003 and 2004, the amount of the Aviation Security Infrastructure Fee imposed on each air carrier and foreign air carrier will not exceed the amount each such carrier paid for the screening of passengers and property transported by passenger aircraft in the United States during calendar year 2000, as determined by the Administrator. 


(d) Each air carrier and foreign air carrier that paid for the screening of passengers and property in calendar year 2000 must fully complete the form set forth in Appendix A to this part titled, “Calendar Year 2000 Costs Paid for Passenger and Property Screening,” and submit the completed form to the Transportation Security Administration by May 18, 2002. 


(e) In the case of a merger, acquisition, corporate restructuring, reorganization, or name change involving an air carrier or foreign air carrier that paid for the screening of passengers and property transported by passenger aircraft in the United States during calendar year 2000, the successor entity must include those screening costs in Appendix A of this part and submit those costs together with its own costs on one form in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. Any other air carrier or foreign air carrier that paid for the screening of passengers and property transported by passenger aircraft in the United States during calendar year 2000 but is no longer providing air transportation must also complete the form set forth in Appendix A and submit the form in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. 


(f) The Administrator has determined that the information submitted pursuant to this part and 49 U.S.C. 44940(a)(2)(B) is Sensitive Security Information and is subject to the non-disclosure requirements of 49 U.S.C. 40119(b). 


(g) The amount of the Aviation Security Infrastructure Fee imposed on each air carrier and foreign air carrier will be redetermined for fiscal years 2005 and beyond, and such redeterminations may be based on the carrier's respective market share or any other appropriate measure in lieu of the measure provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
