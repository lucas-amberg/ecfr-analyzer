(ii) Indicate clearly the scope of the individual's access and movement privileges;


(iii) Indicate clearly an expiration date; and


(iv) Are of sufficient size and appearance as to be readily observable for challenge purposes.


(2) Procedures to ensure that each individual in the secured area or SIDA continuously displays the identification medium issued to that individual on the outermost garment above waist level, or is under escort.

(i) Retrieving expired identification media.


(ii) Reporting lost or stolen identification media.


(iii) Securing unissued identification media stock and supplies.
