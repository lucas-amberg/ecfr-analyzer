# § 1548.5   Adoption and implementation of the security program.

(a) *Security program required.* No indirect air carrier may offer cargo to an aircraft operator operating under a full program or a full all-cargo program specified in part 1544 of this subchapter, or to a foreign air carrier operating under a program under § 1546.101(a), (b), or (e) of this subchapter, unless that indirect air carrier has and carries out an approved security program under this part. Each indirect air carrier that does not currently hold a security program under part 1548, and that offers cargo to an aircraft operator operating under a full all-cargo program or a comparable operation by a foreign air carrier must comply with this section not later than December 1, 2006.


(b) *General requirements.* (1) The security program must provide for the security of the aircraft, as well as that of persons and property traveling in air transportation against acts of criminal violence and air piracy and against the introduction into the aircraft of any unauthorized person, and any unauthorized explosive, incendiary, and other destructive substance or item as provided in the indirect air carrier's security program. This requirement applies—


(i) From the time the indirect air carrier accepts the cargo to the time it transfers the cargo to an entity that is not an employee or agent of the indirect air carrier;


(ii) While the cargo is stored, en route, or otherwise being handled by an employee or agent of the indirect air carrier; and


(iii) Regardless of whether the indirect air carrier has or ever had physical possession of the cargo.


(2) The indirect air carrier must ensure that its employees and agents carry out the requirements of this chapter and the indirect air carrier's security program.


(c) *Content.* Each security program under this part must—


(1) Be designed to prevent or deter the introduction of any unauthorized person, and any unauthorized explosive, incendiary, and other destructive substance or item onto an aircraft.


(2) Include the procedures and description of the facilities and equipment used to comply with the requirements of §§ 1548.9 and 1548.17 regarding the acceptance and offering of cargo.


(3) Include the procedures and syllabi used to accomplish the training required under § 1548.11 of persons who accept, handle, transport, or deliver cargo on behalf of the indirect air carrier.


(d) *Availability.* Each indirect air carrier having a security program must:


(1) Maintain an original of the security program at its corporate office.


(2) Have accessible a complete copy, or the pertinent portions of its security program, or appropriate implementing instructions, at each office where cargo is accepted. An electronic version is adequate.


(3) Make a copy of the security program available for inspection upon the request of TSA.


(4) Restrict the distribution, disclosure, and availability of information contained in its security program to persons with a need to know, as described in part 1520 of this chapter.


(5) Refer requests for such information by other persons to TSA.
