In addition to the definitions in §§ 1500.3, 1500.5, and 1503.202 of subchapter A, the following terms are used in this subchapter:


*Adjudicate* means to make an administrative determination of whether an applicant meets the standards in this subchapter, based on the merits of the issues raised.

*Convicted* means any plea of guilty or nolo contendere, or any finding of guilt, except when the finding of guilt is subsequently overturned on appeal, pardoned, or expunged.
