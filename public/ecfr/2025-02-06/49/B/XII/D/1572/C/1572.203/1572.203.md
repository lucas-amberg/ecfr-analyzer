# § 1572.203   Transportation of explosives from Canada to the United States via railroad carrier.

(a) *Applicability.* This section applies to railroad carriers that carry explosives from Canada to the United States, using a train crew member who is not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident alien of the United States.


(b) *Terms under this section.* For purposes of this section:


*Customs and Border Protection* (CBP) means the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, an agency within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.


*Explosive* means a material that has been examined by the Associate Administrator for Hazardous Materials Safety, Research and Special Programs Administration, in accordance with 49 CFR 173.56, and determined to meet the definition for a Class 1 material in 49 CFR 173.50.


*Known railroad carrier* means a person that has been determined by the Governments of Canada and the United States to be a legitimate business, operating in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations governing the transportation of explosives.


*Known offeror* means an offeror that has been determined by the Governments of Canada and the United States to be a legitimate business, operating in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations governing the transportation of explosives.


*Known train crew member* means an individual used to transport explosives from Canada to the United States, who has been determined by the Governments of Canada and the United States to present no known security concern.


*Lawful permanent resident alien* means an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(20).


*Offeror* means the person offering a shipment to the railroad carrier for transportation from Canada to the United States, and may also be known as the “consignor” in Canada.


*Railroad carrier* means “railroad carrier” as defined in 49 U.S.C. 20102.


(c) *Prior approval of railroad carrier, offeror, and train crew member.* (1) No railroad carrier may transport in commerce any explosive into the United States from Canada, via a train operated by a crew member who is not a U.S. national or lawful permanent resident alien, unless the railroad carrier, offeror, and train crew member are identified on a TSA list as a known railroad carrier, known offeror, and known train crew member, respectively.


(2) The railroad carrier must ensure that it, its offeror, and each of its crew members have been determined to be a known railroad carrier, known offeror, and known train crew member, respectively. If any has not been so determined, the railroad carrier must submit the following information to Transport Canada:


(i) The railroad carrier's identification, including—


(A) Official name;


(B) Business number;


(C) Any trade names; and


(D) Address.


(ii) The following information about any offeror of explosives whose shipments it will carry:


(A) Official name.


(B) Business number.


(C) Address.


(iii) The following information about any train crew member the railroad carrier may use to transport explosives into the United States from Canada, who is neither a U.S. national nor lawful permanent resident alien:


(A) Full name.


(B) Both current and most recent prior residential addresses.


(3) Transport Canada will determine whether the railroad carrier and offeror are legitimately doing business in Canada and will also determine whether the train crew members present no known problems for purposes of this section. Transport Canada will notify TSA of these determinations by forwarding to TSA lists of known railroad carriers, offerors, and train crew members and their identifying information.


(4) TSA will update and maintain the list of known railroad carriers, offerors, and train crew members and forward the list to CBP.


(5) Once included on the list, the railroad carriers, offerors, and train crew members need not obtain prior approval for future transport of explosives under this section.


(d) *TSA checks.* TSA may periodically check the data on the railroad carriers, offerors, and train crew members to confirm their continued eligibility, and may remove from the list any that TSA determines is not known or is a threat to security.


(e) *At the border.* (1) Train crew members who are not U.S. nationals or lawful permanent resident aliens. Upon arrival at a point designated by CBP for inspection of trains crossing into the United States, the train crew members of a train transporting explosives must provide sufficient identification to CBP to enable that agency to determine if each crew member is on the list of known train crew members maintained by TSA.


(2) *Train crew members who are U.S. nationals or lawful permanent resident aliens.* If CBP cannot verify that the crew member is on the list and the crew member is a U.S. national or lawful permanent resident alien, the crew member may be cleared by CBP upon providing—


(i) A valid U.S. passport; or


(ii) One or more other document(s), including a form of U.S. Federal or state Government-issued identification with photograph, acceptable to CBP.


(3) *Compliance.* If a carrier attempts to enter the U.S. without having complied with this section, CBP will deny entry of the explosives and may take other appropriate action.
