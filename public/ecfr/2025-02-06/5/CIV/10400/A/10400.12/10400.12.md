# § 10400.12   Fees to be charged—miscellaneous provisions.

(a) Payment for FOIA services may be made by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States. IPEC will provide the requester with instructions on how to make the payment. IPEC will provide a receipt for fees paid upon request. IPEC will not refund fees paid for services actually rendered.


(b) IPEC may require advance payment (or a satisfactory written assurance of full payment) where the estimated fee exceeds $250, or a requester previously failed to pay within 30 calendar days of the billing date. IPEC will not process the request until the requester either makes the advance payment or provides a satisfactory written assurance.


(c) IPEC may assess interest charges beginning the 31st day of billing. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of Title 31, United States Code, and will accrue from the date of the billing.


(d) IPEC may assess search charges where records are not located or where records are exempt from disclosure.
