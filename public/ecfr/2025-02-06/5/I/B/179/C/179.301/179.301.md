# § 179.301   Scope of regulations.

These regulations apply to the collection of debts owed to the United States arising from transactions with OPM other than those involving payments made from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (the Fund), or where a request for an offset from OPM's administrative accounts—other than the Fund—is received by OPM from another Federal agency. Regulations for other agencies to request OPM's Retirement and Insurance Group to recover a debt from the Fund are provided at subpart R of part 831 and subpart D of part 845 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations. These regulations are consistent with the Federal Claims Collection Standards on Administrative Offset issued jointly by the Department of Justice and the General Accounting Office as set forth in 4 CFR 102.3.
