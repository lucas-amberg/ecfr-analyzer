Claims in excess of $500 shall be filed with the Office of the General Counsel, Office of Personnel Management, 1900 E Street NW., Washington, DC 20415. Claims shall be in writing, using G.C. Form 33 when available, and shall contain as a minimum:


(1) Name, address, and place of employment of the claimant;


(2) Place and date of the damage or loss;


(3) A brief statement of the facts and circumstances surrounding the damage or loss;


(4) Cost, date, and place of acquisition of each piece of property damaged or lost;


(5) Two itemized repair estimates, or value estimates, whichever is applicable;


(6) Copies of police reports, if applicable;


(7) A statement from the claimant's supervisor that the loss was incident to service;


(8) A statement that the property was or was not insured;


(9) With respect to claims involving thefts or losses in quarters or other places where the property was reasonably kept, a statement as to what security precautions were taken to protect the property involved;

(11) Other evidence as may be required.


(b) *Single claim.* A single claim shall be presented for all lost or damaged property resulting from the same incident.

Where the cost to repair damaged property does not exceed $100 per item and the claims investigator has inspected the damaged property, the claimant and the approving authority may agree upon a reasonable amount to be claimed for repair of an individual item in lieu of an independent estimate by a qualified repairman. In such a case, the claims investigator and the approving authority will certify that the property has been examined and that the amount claimed is a reasonable allowance for the cost of the repairs.
