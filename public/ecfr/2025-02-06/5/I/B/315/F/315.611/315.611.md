# § 315.611   Appointment of certain veterans who have competed under agency merit promotion announcements.

(a) *Agency authority.* An agency may appoint a preference eligible or a veteran who has substantially completed at least 3 years of continuous active military service provided 


(1) The veteran was selected from among the best qualified following competition under a merit promotion announcement open to candidates outside the agency's workforce; and 


(2) The veteran's most recent separation from the military was under honorable conditions. 


(b) *Definitions.* “Agency” in this context means an executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105. The agency determines in individual cases whether a candidate was released “shortly before” completing the required 3 years and should therefore be eligible for appointment.
