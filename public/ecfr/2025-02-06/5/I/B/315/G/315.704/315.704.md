# ยง 315.704   Conversion to career employment from indefinite or temporary employment.

(a) *General.* Employees serving after February 7, 1968, in competitive positions under indefinite appointments or temporary appointments pending establishment of a register or as status quo employees acquire competitive status and are entitled to have their employment converted to career employment when such employees:


(1) Complete a total of at least 3 years of service in such a position under one or more such appointments without a break in service of more than 30 calendar days or without an interruption by nonqualifying service of more than 30 calendar days;


(2) Have rendered satisfactory service for the 12 months immediately preceding the conversion; and


(3) Meet applicable qualification requirements for the positions and are otherwise eligible for career employment. This paragraph does not apply to employees serving under an overseas limited appointment or in positions above GS-15 or equivalent. 


(b) *Creditable service.* (1) In computing creditable service under paragraph (a) of this section for an employee who left a competitive position in which he or she was serving under a qualifying appointment covered in paragraph (a) of this section to enter the armed forces and who is reemployed in such a position within 120 calendar days after separation under honorable conditions, the period from the date he or she left the position to the date of reemployment is creditable. 


(2) The Office shall publish in its operating manuals the conditions under which full-time, part-time, and intermittent employment is creditable in meeting the service requirement under paragraph (a) of this section. 


(c) *Termination after failure to meet conversion requirements.* An employing agency shall terminate employees covered by paragraph (a) of this section not later than 90 days after they complete the 3-year service requirement referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if they have not met the requirements and conditions of paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this section before the end of the 90-day period. For an employee who is reemployed after intervening service in the armed forces, the 90-day period begins on the date of reemployment if the employee's combined civilian and military service satisfies the 3-year service requirement on that date. 


(d) *Administrative error.* When an employee has met the service requirement under paragraph (a)(1) of this section but, because of administrative error or oversight, has not been converted to career employment within the time limits prescribed in this section, the employing agency may effect the employee's conversion as of the date on which he or she met the service requirement, even though the time limit for such conversion has expired.
