# § 316.901   Appointment authority.

In accordance with the provisions of this section, an agency may make a time-limited appointment of an eligible and qualified post-secondary student, to any position in the competitive service, at the General Schedule (GS) 11 level or below (or equivalent), without regard to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 3309 through 3319 and 3330. An agency may appoint an individual for an initial period not to exceed 1 year, or for an initial period expected to last more than 1 year but less than 4 years, in accordance with §§ 316.401(c)(1) and 316.301(a) and (b), respectively, to coincide with the individual's academic curriculum. In either case an agency may extend or seek extension from OPM, as appropriate in accordance with this part, of an initial appointment for a period that will allow the post-secondary student to complete his or her academic requirements leading to the awarding of a degree or certificate, as appropriate.
