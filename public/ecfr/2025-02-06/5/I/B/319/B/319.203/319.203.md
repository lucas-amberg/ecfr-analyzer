(b) Before an SL or ST position may be established, an agency must:


(1) Prepare a description of the duties, responsibilities, and supervisory relationships of the position; and 


(2) Determine, consistent with published position classification standards and guides and accepted classification principles, that the position is properly classified above GS-15. In addition, for an ST position an agency must determine that the position meets the functional research and development criteria described in ยง 319.103.
