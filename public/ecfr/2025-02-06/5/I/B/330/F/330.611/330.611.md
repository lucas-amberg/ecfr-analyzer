# ยง 330.611   Establishing CTAP selection priority.

(a) CTAP selection priority for a specific agency vacancy begins when:


(1) The CTAP eligible submits all required application materials, including proof of eligibility, within agency-established timeframes; and,


(2) The agency determines the eligible is well-qualified for the vacancy.


(b) An agency may allow CTAP eligible employees to become CTAP selection priority candidates for positions in other local commuting areas only if there are no CTAP selection priority candidates within the local commuting area of the vacancy.


(c) An agency may deny future CTAP selection priority for agency positions if the CTAP eligible declines an offer of permanent appointment at any grade level (whether it is a competitive or excepted appointment).
