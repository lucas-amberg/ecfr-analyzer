# § 339.104   Definitions.

For purposes of this part—


*Accommodation* means *reasonable accommodation* as described in the ADA.


*Arduous or hazardous positions* means positions that are dangerous or physically demanding to such a degree that an employee's medical and/or physical condition is necessarily an important consideration in determining ability to perform safely and efficiently.


*Medical condition* means a health impairment which results from birth, injury or disease, including mental disorder.


*Medical documentation* or *documentation of a medical condition* means a copy of a dated, written and signed statement, or a dated copy of actual medical office or hospital records, from a licensed physician or other licensed health practitioner, as these terms are defined below, that contains necessary and relevant information to enable the agency to make an employment decision. To be acceptable, the diagnosis or clinical impression must be justified according to established diagnostic criteria and the conclusions and recommendations must be consistent with generally accepted professional standards. The determination that the diagnosis meets these criteria is made by or in coordination with a licensed physician or, if appropriate, a practitioner of the same discipline as the one who issued the documentation. An acceptable diagnosis must include the information identified by the agency as necessary and relevant to its employment decision. This information may include, but is not limited to, the following:


(1) The history of the medical condition(s), including references to findings from previous examinations, treatment, and responses to treatment;


(2) Clinical findings from the most recent medical evaluation, including any of the following: Findings of physical examination; results of laboratory tests; X-rays; EKGs and/or other special evaluations or diagnostic procedures; and, in the case of psychiatric examination or psychological assessment, the findings of a mental status examination and/or the results of psychological tests, if appropriate;


(3) Diagnosis, including the current clinical status;


(4) Prognosis, including plans for future treatment and an estimate of the expected date of full or partial recovery;


(5) An explanation of the impact of the medical condition(s) on overall health and activities, including the basis for any conclusion as to whether restrictions or accommodations are necessary and, if determined to be necessary, an explanation supporting that determination; and, either of the following:


(6) An explanation of the medical basis for any conclusion that indicates the likelihood that the applicant or employee will suffer sudden incapacitation or subtle incapacitation by carrying out, with or without accommodation, the tasks or duties of a specific position; or


(7) Narrative explanation of the medical basis for any conclusion that the medical condition has or has not become static or well-stabilized and the likelihood that the applicant or employee may experience sudden incapacitation or subtle incapacitation as a result of the medical condition. In this context, “static or well-stabilized” medical condition means a medical condition which is not likely to change as a consequence of the natural progression of the condition, such as a result of the normal aging process, or in response to the work environment or the work itself.


*Medical evaluation program* means a program of recurring medical examinations or tests established by written agency policy or directive, to safeguard the health of employees whose work may subject them or others to significant health or safety risks due to occupational or environmental exposure or demands. For example, an agency policy or directive may include medical clearances and medical surveillance to test for occupational exposure to biological, chemical, and/or radiological hazardous agents, occupational diseases, and occupational risk.


*Medical restriction* is a medical determination that an applicant or employee is limited, or prevented from performing a certain type or duration of work or activity (e.g., standing and/or ability to concentrate) or motion (e.g., bending, lifting, pulling), because of a particular medical condition or physical limitation. The purpose of a medical restriction is to try to prevent aggravation, acceleration, exacerbation, or permanent worsening of the medical condition or physical limitation.


*Medical standard* is a written description of the minimum medical requirements necessary for an applicant or employee to perform essential job duties as a condition of employment.


*Medical surveillance* is the on-going systematic collection and analysis of health data to improve and protect the health and safety of employees in the workplace, and to monitor for health trends both in individual workers and in population of workers. Medical surveillance can include the tracking of occupational injuries, illnesses, hazards, and exposures, as well as laboratory and examination-based medical data, in order to identify findings that could provide an early warning of, or indicate the risk for, an occupational disease. Medical surveillance also is part of compliance with those Federal and state regulations that require medical monitoring when employees use or are exposed to certain hazardous materials.


*Physical requirement* is a written description of job-related physical abilities that are essential for performance of the duties of a specific position.


*Physician* means a licensed Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of Osteopathy, or a physician who is serving on active duty in the uniformed services and is designated by the uniformed service to conduct examinations under this part.


*Practitioner* means a person providing health services who is not a medical doctor, but who is certified by a national organization, licensed by a State, and/or registered as a health professional to provide the health service in question.


*Subtle incapacitation* means gradual, initially imperceptible impairment of physical or mental function, whether reversible or not, which is likely to result in safety, performance and/or conduct issues that may undermine the agency's commitment to maintaining a safe working environment for all employees and others.


*Sudden incapacitation* means abrupt onset of loss of control of physical or mental function(s), whether reversible or not, which is likely to result in safety, performance or conduct issues that may undermine the agency's commitment to maintaining a safe working environment for all employees and others.
