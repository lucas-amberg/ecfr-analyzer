# § 340.202   General.

(a) *Definitions. Part-time career employment* means regularly scheduled work of from 16 to 32 hours per week performed by an employee of an agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 3401 (a) through (f), who has an appointment in tenure group I or II and who becomes employed on such part-time basis on or after April 8, 1979. 


*Tenure group I* applies to employees in the competitive service under career appointments who are not serving probation and permanent employees in the excepted service whose appointments carry no restrictions or conditions. 


*Tenure group II* applies to employees in the competitive service serving probation, career-conditional employees, and career employees in obligated positions. It also includes employees in the excepted service serving trial periods, whose tenure is indefinite solely because they occupy obligated positions; or whose tenure is equivalent to career-conditional in the competitive service. 


(b) *Agency Exceptions.* As an exception to the general definition of part-time employment in § 340.202(a) and under the authority provided in 5 U.S.C. 3402(a)(3), an agency may permit an employee who has an appointment in tenure group I or II to perform regularly scheduled work of from 1 to 15 hours per week. 


(c) *Mixed Tours of Duty.* The provisions of this subpart and the term “part-time career employment” do not apply to employees with appointments in tenure groups I or II who work under mixed tours of duty. For this purpose, a mixed tour of duty consists of annually recurring periods of full-time, part-time, or intermittent service as long as the employee does not work part-time more than 6 pay periods per calendar year.
