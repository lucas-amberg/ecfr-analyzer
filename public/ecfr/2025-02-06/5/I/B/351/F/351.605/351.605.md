# § 351.605   Liquidation provisions.

When an agency will abolish all positions in a competitive area within 180 days, it must release employees in group and subgroup order consistent with § 351.601(a). At its discretion, the agency may release the employees in group order without regard to retention standing within a subgroup, except as provided in § 351.606. When an agency releases an employee under this section, the notice to the employee must cite this authority and give the date the liquidation will be completed. An agency may also apply §§ 351.607 and 351.608 in a liquidation.
