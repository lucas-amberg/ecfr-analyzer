# ยง 351.807   Certification of Expected Separation.

(a) For the purpose of enabling otherwise eligible employees to be considered for eligibility to participate in dislocated worker programs under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 administered by the U.S. Department of Labor, an agency may issue a Certificate of Expected Separation to a competing employee who the agency believes, with a reasonable degree of certainty, will be separated from Federal employment by reduction in force procedures under this part. A certification may be issued up to 6 months prior to the effective date of the reduction in force. 


(b) This certification may be issued to a competing employee only when the agency determines:


(1) There is a good likelihood the employee will be separated under this part;


(2) Employment opportunities in the same or similar position in the local commuting area are limited or nonexistent;


(3) Placement opportunities within the employee's own or other Federal agencies in the local commuting area are limited or nonexistent; and


(4) If eligible for optional retirement, the employee has not filed a retirement application or otherwise indicated in writing an intent to retire.


(c) A certification is to be addressed to each individual eligible employee and must be signed by an appropriate agency official. A certification must contain the expected date of reduction in force, a statement that each factor in paragraph (b) of this section has been satisfied, and a description of Workforce Investment Act of 1998, title I, programs, the Interagency Placement Program, and the Reemployment Priority List. 


(d) A certification may not be used to satisfy any of the notice requirements elsewhere in this subpart.


(e) An agency determination of eligibility for certification may not be appealed to OPM or the Merit Systems Protection Board.


(f) An agency may also enroll eligible employees on the agency's Reemployment Priority List up to 6 months in advance of a reduction in force. For requirements and criteria, see subpart B of part 330 of this chapter.
