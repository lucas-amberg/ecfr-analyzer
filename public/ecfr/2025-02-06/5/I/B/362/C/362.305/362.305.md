# ยง 362.305   Conversion to the competitive service.

(a) An agency may noncompetitively convert a Recent Graduate who is a U.S. citizen to a competitive service term or permanent position when the Recent Graduate has:


(1) Successfully completed at least 1-year of continuous service in addition to all the requirements of the Recent Graduates Program;


(2) Demonstrated successful job performance consistent with the applicable performance appraisal program established under the agency's approved performance appraisal system that results in a rating of record (or summary rating) of at least Fully Successful or equivalent and a recommendation for conversion by the first-level supervisor; and


(3) Met the OPM Qualification Standard for the competitive service position to which the Recent Graduate will be converted.


(b) An agency must make the noncompetitive conversion effective on the date the service requirement is met, or at the end of an agency-approved extension, if applicable.


(c) A Recent Graduate may be converted to a permanent or term position at a different agency when the following conditions are met:


(1) The employing (or losing) agency is unable to convert the Recent Graduate to a term or permanent position in the competitive service in the current organizational unit of the employing agency or another component within the same Department or agency. The reasons for conversion at another agency may include unforeseen budgetary constraints; reorganizations; abolishment of positions; completion of cohort-based Pathways programs; or other appropriate reasons. Such a conversion to another agency may not be due to issues related to misconduct, poor performance, or suitability;


(2) Conversion must occur on or before the end of the agency prescribed Program period, plus any agency-approved extension; and


(3) The position at the new agency must have a full performance level that is equivalent or less than the position they would have been converted to at the prior agency.
