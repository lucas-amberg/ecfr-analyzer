# ยง 470.317   Project evaluation.

(a) *Compliance evaluation.* OPM will review the operation of the project periodically to determine its compliance with the requirements of this part and the approved project plan. If OPM determines that an agency is not meeting legal, regulatory, or project plan requirements, it may, as appropriate, direct the agency to take corrective action or terminate the project.


(b) *Results evaluation.* All approved project plans will contain an evaluation section to measure the impact of the project results in relation to its objectives and to determine whether or not permanent changes in law and/or regulation should be considered or proposed. Where the project plan provides for agency evaluation of project results, OPM will review those project evaluation efforts, may conduct evaluations of its own, on a sample basis, to verify results, and may report its own conclusions. If OPM or the agency determines that an experiment is creating a substantial hardship on, or is not in the best interest of, the public, the Federal Government, employees, or eligibles, even though the experiment is being conducted properly, OPM or the agency may jointly or unilaterally terminate the project.
