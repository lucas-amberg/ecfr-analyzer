An employee whose position is reclassified to a lower grade which is based in whole or in part on a classification decision is entitled to a prompt written notice from the agency.

(b) Of the time limits within which the employee's appeal must be filed in order to preserve any retroactive benefits under ยง 511.703; and


(c) Any other appeal or grievance rights available under applicable law, rule, regulation or negotiated agreement.
