# ยง 511.702   Agency or Office classification appeal decisions.

(a) Subject to ยง 511.703, the effective date of a change in the classification of a position resulting from a classification appeal decision by either an agency or the Office is not earlier than the date of the decision and not later than the beginning of the fourth pay period following the date of the decision, except when a subsequent date is specifically provided in the decision.


(b) The implementation of the decision may be suspended by the Office when it determines before the effective date that a review of the decision is warranted. The determination to suspend implementation may be made by the Director or the Director's designee. Suspending the implementation does not change the effective date of the decision except when the original decision requires that the grade or pay of the position be reduced and the employee is not entitled to grade or pay retention.


(c) When the original decision requires that the grade or pay of the position be reduced and the employee is not entitled to grade or pay retention, the reviewing authority, if sustaining the original decision, shall issue a new certificate and the effective date of the new certificate shall be not earlier than the date of the new decision and not later than the beginning of the fourth pay period following the date of the new decision, unless a subsequent date is specifically stated in the new decision.
