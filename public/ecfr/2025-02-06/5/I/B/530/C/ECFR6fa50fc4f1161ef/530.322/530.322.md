# ยง 530.322   Setting pay when a special rate schedule is newly established or increased.

(a) *General rule.* When an employee holds a position that becomes covered by a newly established special rate schedule (including a schedule for which coverage is expanded) or increased special rate schedule (including an increased special rate range within a schedule), the agency must set the employee's special rate at the step (or relative position in range for a GM employee) of the grade on the new special rate schedule that corresponds to the employee's existing numerical step (or relative position in range for a GM employee) as in effect immediately before the new special rate schedule takes effect, except as otherwise provided in this section. The corresponding special rate is determined by adding the applicable special rate supplement on top of the employee's GS rate, subject to the limitation that no special rate may exceed the rate for level IV of the Executive Schedule. For an employee receiving an LEO special base rate, add the applicable special rate supplement to the GS rate for the employee's grade and step, except as otherwise provided under ยง 530.304(d).


(b) *Employee entitled to a higher rate of basic pay.* As provided in ยง 530.303(d), if an employee meeting the coverage conditions for a newly established or increased special rate schedule is entitled to a higher rate of basic pay under other legal authority, the employee must be paid at that higher rate.


(c) *Employee receiving a retained rate.* When an employee is receiving a retained rate immediately before the employee's position is covered by a newly established or increased special rate schedule, the agency must determine the employee's rate of pay consistent with the requirements in 5 CFR part 536, subpart C (or 5 CFR 359.705 for a former member of the Senior Executive Service receiving a retained rate under that section).
