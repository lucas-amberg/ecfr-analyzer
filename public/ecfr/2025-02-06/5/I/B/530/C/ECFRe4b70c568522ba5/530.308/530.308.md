# ยง 530.308   Treatment of special rate as basic pay.

Except as otherwise specifically provided under other legal authority, a special rate is considered a rate of basic pay only for the following purposes:


(a) The purposes for which a locality rate is considered to be a rate of basic pay in computing other payments or benefits to the extent provided by 5 CFR 531.610, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section;


(b) Computation of foreign area post differentials under 5 U.S.C. 5925(a) and danger pay allowances under 5 U.S.C. 5928; and


(c) Application of pay administration provisions for prevailing rate employees which consider rates of basic pay under the GS pay system in setting pay (except as otherwise provided in 5 CFR part 532), subject to the requirement that, if the employee's actual special rate would not apply at the official worksite for the prevailing rate position, a special rate may be used only if it is a corresponding special rate on a special rate schedule that would cover the employee if his or her GS position of record were located at the same official worksite as the prevailing rate position, consistent with the geographic conversion rule in 5 CFR 531.205.
