# § 531.404   Earning within-grade increase.

An employee paid at less than the maximum rate of the grade of his or her position shall earn advancement in pay to the next higher step of the grade or the next higher rate within the grade (as defined in § 531.403) upon meeting the following three requirements established by law:


(a) The employee's performance must be at an acceptable level of competence, as defined in this subpart. To be determined at an acceptable level of competence, the employee's most recent rating of record (as defined in § 430.203 of this chapter) shall be at least Level 3 (“Fully Successful” or equivalent).


(1) When a within-grade increase decision is not consistent with the employee's most recent rating of record a more current rating of record must be prepared. 


(2) The rating of record used as the basis for an acceptable level of competence determination for a within-grade increase must have been assigned no earlier than the most recently completed appraisal period. 


(b) The employee must have completed the required waiting period for advancement to the next higher step of the grade of his or her position. 


(c) The employee must not have received an equivalent increase during the waiting period.
