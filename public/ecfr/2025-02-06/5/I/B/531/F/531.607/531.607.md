# ยง 531.607   Computing hourly, daily, weekly, and biweekly locality rates.

(a) Apply the following methods to convert an annual locality rate to an hourly, daily, weekly, or biweekly rate:


(1) To derive an hourly rate, divide the annual locality rate by 2,087 and round to the nearest cent, counting one-half cent and over as the next higher cent.


(2) To derive a daily rate, multiply the hourly rate by the number of daily hours of service required by the employee's basic daily tour of duty.


(3) To derive a weekly or biweekly rate, multiply the hourly rate by 40 or 80, as applicable.


(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, for a firefighter whose pay is computed under 5 U.S.C. 5545b, a firefighter hourly locality rate is computed using a divisor of 2,756 hours instead of 2,087, as prescribed in 5 CFR part 550, subpart M. Also, such a firefighter's weekly and biweekly locality rates must be based on the firefighter's extended tour of duty as prescribed in that subpart.
