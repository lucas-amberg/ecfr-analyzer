# Appendix C to Subpart B of Part 532â€”Appropriated Fund Wage and Survey Areas


This appendix lists the wage area definitions for appropriated fund employees. With a few exceptions, each area is defined in terms of county units, independent cities, or, in the New England States, of entire township or city units. Each wage area definition consists of:


(1) *Wage area title.* Wage areas usually carry the title of the principal city in the area. Sometimes, however, the area title reflects a broader geographic area, such as Wyoming or Eastern Tennessee.


(2) *Survey area definition.* Lists each county, independent city, or township in the survey area.


(3) *Area of application definition.* Lists each county, independent city, or township which, in addition to the survey area, is in the area of application.
