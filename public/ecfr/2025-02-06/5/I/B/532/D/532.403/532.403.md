(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a new appointment to a position shall be made at the minimum rate of the appropriate grade.


(b) An agency may make a new appointment at a rate above the minimum rate of the appropriate grade in recognition of an appointees' special qualifications. In determining the rate at which to set the appointee's pay:


(1) An agency must consider how the step has been set for employees who had similar qualifications (based on the level, type, or quality of the appointee's skills or competencies or other qualities and experiences) and who have been newly appointed to positions that are similar to the appointee's position (based on the position's occupational series, grade level, organization, geographic location, or other job-relevant factors), if applicable;


(2) An agency may not consider the appointee's pay history (*i.e.,* existing pay or prior pay) or a pay rate from a competing job offer; and


(3) An agency must consider other relevant factors (e.g., the level, type, or quality of the appointee's skills or competencies; or significant disparities between Federal and non-Federal salaries for the skills and competencies required in the position to be filled).


(c) An agency shall make a new appointment at a step-rate above the minimum rate of a grade if the lead agency for the wage area has designated, in accordance with ยง 532.249, a step-rate above the first step-rate of a grade as the minimum step-rate at which a position may be filled.
