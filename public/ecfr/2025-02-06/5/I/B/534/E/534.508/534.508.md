# § 534.508   Reductions in a rate of basic pay.

(a) Any reduction in a rate of basic pay for an SL or ST employee is subject to part 752, subpart D of this chapter except as otherwise provided in this section.


(b) If an employee is removed from an SL or ST position and placed in a General Schedule position under procedures in part 752, subpart D of this chapter or part 432 of this chapter providing for reduction in grade, or otherwise moves voluntarily or involuntarily to a General Schedule position, the employee is entitled to the minimum rate of basic pay, as defined in § 531.203 of this chapter, for the General Schedule grade unless the agency sets the employee's pay at a higher rate under—


(1) The maximum payable rate rule in § 531.221 of this chapter, if applicable;


(2) The superior qualifications and special needs pay-setting authority in § 531.212 of this chapter, if applicable; or


(3) The pay retention rules in part 536, subpart C of this chapter, if applicable.


(c) An agency may reduce an SL or ST employee's rate of basic pay, subject to part 752, subpart D of this chapter, upon movement to a different SL or ST position within the agency. If an SL or ST employee elects to accept a reduction in pay to facilitate a reassignment and the agency documents the voluntary nature of the action, the resulting pay reduction is not subject to part 752, subpart D of this chapter.


(d) If an agency justifies an increase in an SL or ST employee's rate of basic pay under § 534.510 upon the employee's movement to another SL or ST position having a substantially greater impact on agency performance with the understanding that the employee will be reduced to his or her former rate of basic pay upon movement out of the position, and the agency documents the voluntary nature of the action, the resulting reduction to the former rate of basic pay (or to a higher rate of basic pay determined under this subpart that is within the pay range applicable to the SL or ST position under § 534.504(a)) is not subject to part 752, subpart D of this chapter.


(e) A reduction in the rate of basic pay of an SL or ST employee under § 534.506(b) upon transfer is considered voluntary upon the employee's acceptance of the appointment and is not subject to part 752, subpart D of this chapter, except that an SL or ST employee's rate of basic pay may not be reduced upon transfer under circumstances described in § 534.509(a). A reduction in the rate of basic pay of an SL or ST employee upon a transfer of function under part 351, subpart C of this chapter from another agency is subject to part 752, subpart D of this chapter unless otherwise provided by statute.
