# § 534.510   Off-cycle pay increases.

(a) An authorized agency official may provide an off-cycle pay increase to a senior professional if, and only if, the agency head or a designee who provides the certifications described in § 430.404(a)(6)(i), (ii) and (iii) of this chapter for all senior professionals in the agency determines an off-cycle pay increase is warranted and approves the amount of the increase, subject to the requirements of this section and the agency's written procedures established under § 534.505. The authority to approve an off-cycle pay increase under this section may not be further delegated.


(b) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, an off-cycle pay increase must be supported by factors that distinguish the level of the senior professional's performance and/or contributions to agency performance from that of his or her peers, as applicable, and from that sufficiently rewarded through the annual pay adjustment. In assessing the warrant for an off-cycle pay increase, the approving official may consider such factors as—


(1) A senior professional's exceptionally meritorious accomplishments that contribute significantly to the agency's performance;


(2) The need to offer a pay increase to reassign a senior professional to a position that has a substantially greater impact on agency performance; and


(3) The need to retain a senior professional whose contributions are critical to the agency and who is likely to leave the agency in the absence of a pay increase.


(c) Each off-cycle pay increase that is based upon such factors as are described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section must be documented in accordance with § 534.507(b) through (e), except that the agency must also provide information to explain how each applicable factor was considered in determining the pay increase. This information may be derived from the agency's written pay procedures established under § 534.505, agency performance management system activities, or other sources the agency deems useful for this purpose.


(d) If the maximum rate of basic pay applicable to an agency's senior professionals increases during the 1 year period following the annual pay adjustment under § 534.507(a)(1) for reasons other than a change in the certification status of an applicable performance appraisal system, the agency head or a designee who provides the certifications described in § 430.404(a)(6)(i), (ii) and (iii) of this chapter for all senior professionals in the agency may consider whether, and to what extent, an additional pay increase may be warranted for a senior professional based on the same criteria used in determining his or her annual pay increase. However, if the increase in maximum rate of basic pay is due to a change in the certification status of an applicable performance appraisal system, the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section apply.


(e) An off-cycle pay increase granted under this section will be effective prospectively, not retroactively.
