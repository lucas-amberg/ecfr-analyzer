# § 536.205   Applicability of retained grade.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an agency must treat an employee's retained grade as the employee's grade for all purposes, including pay and pay administration, premium pay, retirement, life insurance, and eligibility for training. If the employee's actual position of record is under a different covered pay system than the covered pay system associated with the retained grade, the agency also must treat the employee as being under the covered pay system associated with the retained grade for the same purposes.


(b) An agency may not use an employee's retained grade—


(1) In any reduction in force procedure;


(2) To determine whether an employee has been reduced in grade for the purpose of terminating grade or pay retention (*i.e.*, based on personal cause or at the employee's request);


(3) To determine whether an employee retains status as a GM employee (as defined in 5 CFR 531.203); or


(4) To determine whether an employee is exempt or nonexempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended.
