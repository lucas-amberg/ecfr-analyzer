# § 536.208   Termination of grade retention.

(a) Grade retention under § 536.201 terminates if any of the conditions listed in § 536.207(a) occurs after commencement of the 2-year period of grade retention.


(b) Grade retention under § 536.202 terminates if any of the conditions listed in § 536.207(b) occurs after the commencement of the 2-year period of grade retention.


(c) Termination of grade retention benefits takes effect—


(1) At the end of the day before separation from service if termination is the result of a break in service;


(2) At the end of the day before placement if the termination is the result of the employee's placement in another position; or


(3) At the end of the last day of the pay period in which the employee—


(i) Declines a reasonable offer;


(ii) Elects to terminate grade retention benefits (except that, if an employee's election specifically provides that the termination will take effect at the end of a later pay period, the election is considered to be made effective on the last day of that later pay period for the purpose of applying this paragraph); or


(iii) Fails to enroll in, or comply with reasonable written requirements established to assure full consideration under, a program providing priority consideration for placement.


(d) If an employee's entitlement to grade retention terminates under this section, the employee's rate of basic pay must be set in accordance with the pay-setting rules and pay rates applicable to the employee's position of record (e.g., 5 CFR part 531, subpart B, for GS positions). An employee is not entitled to pay retention under subpart C of this part based on a reduction in basic pay resulting from waiver of the employee's grade retention entitlement under paragraph (a)(5) or (b) of § 536.207.
