(b) At the request of an employee, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2105, the head of an agency (or designee) may grant compensatory time off from an employee's basic work requirement under a flexible work schedule under 5 U.S.C. 6122 instead of payment under § 550.113 for an equal amount of overtime work, whether or not irregular or occasional in nature. 


(c) The head of an agency may provide that an employee whose rate of basic pay exceeds the maximum rate for GS-10 (including any applicable special rate of pay for law enforcement officers or special pay adjustment for law enforcement officers under section 403 or 404 of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (Pub.

(1) Receive payment for such unused compensatory time off at the dollar value prescribed in paragraph (g) of this section; or


(2) Forfeit the unused compensatory time off, unless the failure to take the compensatory time off is due to an exigency of the service beyond the employee's control, in which case the agency head must provide payment for the unused compensatory time off at the dollar value prescribed in paragraph (g) of this section.


(e) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, compensatory time off to an employee's credit as of May 14, 2007 must be used by the end of the pay period ending 3 years after May 14, 2007.

(f)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, an employee with unused compensatory time off under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section who transfers to another agency or separates from Federal service before the expiration of the time limit established under paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section may receive overtime pay or forfeit the unused compensatory time off, consistent with the employing agency's policy established under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.
