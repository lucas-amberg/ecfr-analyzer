# ยง 550.710   Suspension of severance pay.

When an individual entitled to severance pay is employed by the Government of the United States or the government of the District of Columbia under a nonqualifying time-limited appointment, severance pay must be suspended during the life of the appointment. Severance pay resumes, without any recomputation, when the employee separates from the nonqualifying time-limited appointment. The resumed severance payments are the responsibility of the agency that originally triggered the individual's severance pay entitlement by separating the individual while he or she was serving under a qualifying appointment.
