# § 550.1306   Relationship to other entitlements.

(a) A firefighter who is compensated under this subpart is entitled to overtime pay as provided under this subpart, but may not receive additional premium pay under any other provision of subchapter V of chapter 55 of title 5, United States Code, including night pay, Sunday pay, holiday pay, and hazardous duty pay. A firefighter is not entitled to receive paid holiday time off when not working on a holiday, but may be allowed to use annual or sick leave, as appropriate, or may be granted excused absence at the agency's discretion. 


(b) A firefighter who is subject to section 7(k) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and who is subject to this subpart is deemed to be appropriately compensated under section 7(k) of the FLSA if the requirements of § 550.1304(a) are satisfied.


(c) In computing a lump-sum payment for accumulated annual leave under 5 U.S.C. 5551 and 5552 for firefighters with an uncommon tour of duty established under § 630.210 of this chapter for leave purposes, an agency must use the rates of pay for the position held by the firefighter that apply to hours in that uncommon tour of duty, including regular overtime pay for such hours.


(d) A firefighter compensated under this subpart shall receive basic pay and overtime pay for his or her regular tour of duty in any week in which attendance at agency-sanctioned training reduces the hours in the firefighter's regular tour of duty, as provided in § 410.402(b)(6) of this chapter. 


(e) In applying the compensatory time off provision in § 550.114(c), compare the firefighter's annual rate of basic pay to the annual rate of basic pay for GS-10, step 10.
