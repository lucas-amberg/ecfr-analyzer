# § 551.421   Regular working hours.

(a) Under the Act there is no requirement that a Federal employee have a regularly scheduled administrative workweek. However, under title 5 United States Code, and part 610 of this chapter, the head of an agency is required to establish work schedules for his or her employees. In determining what activities constitute hours of work under the Act, there is generally a distinction based on whether the activity is performed by an employee during regular working hours or outside regular working hours. For purposes of this part, “regular working hours” means the days and hours of an employee's regularly scheduled administrative workweek established under part 610 of this chapter.


(b) [Reserved]
