# § 551.512   Overtime pay entitlement.

(a) An employee's overtime entitlement under this subpart includes:


(1) The straight time rate of pay times all overtime hours worked; plus


(2) One-half times the employee's hourly regular rate of pay times all overtime hours worked.


(b) An employee's “straight time rate of pay” is equal to the employee's rate of pay for his or her position (exclusive of any premiums, differentials, or cash awards or bonuses) except for an employee who is authorized annual premium pay under § 550.141 or § 550.151 of this chapter. For an employee who is authorized annual premium pay, straight time rate of pay is equal to basic pay plus annual premium pay divided by the hours for which the basic pay plus annual premium pay are intended.


(c) An employee has been paid in compliance with the overtime pay provisions of this subpart only if the employee has received pay at a rate at least equal to the employee's straight time rate of pay for all nonovertime hours of work in the workweek.
