# § 551.709   Availability of information.

(a) Except when the claimant has requested confidentiality, the agency and the claimant must provide to each other a copy of all information submitted with respect to the claim.


(b) When a claimant has not requested confidentiality, OPM will disclose to the parties concerned the information contained in an FLSA claim file. When a claimant has requested confidentiality, OPM will delete any information identifying the claimant before disclosing the information in an FLSA claim file to the parties concerned. For the purposes of this subpart, “the parties concerned” means the claimant, any representative designated in writing, and any representative of the agency or OPM involved in the proceeding.


(c) Except when the claimant has requested confidentiality or the disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, OPM, upon a request which identifies the individual from whose file the information is sought, will disclose the following information from a claim file to a member of the public:


(1) Confirmation of the name of the individual from whose file the information is sought and the names of the other parties concerned;


(2) The remedy sought;


(3) The status of the claim;


(4) The decision on the claim; and


(5) With the consent of the parties concerned, other reasonably identified information from the file.
