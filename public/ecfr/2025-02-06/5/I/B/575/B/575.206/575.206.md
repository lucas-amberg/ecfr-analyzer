# § 575.206   Authorizing a relocation incentive.

(a) *Authority of authorized agency official.* An authorized agency official retains sole and exclusive discretion, subject only to OPM review and oversight, to—


(1) Determine when a position is likely to be difficult to fill under paragraph (b) of this section;


(2) Approve a relocation incentive for an employee under § 575.205;


(3) Establish the criteria for determining the amount of a relocation incentive and the length of a service period under §§ 575.209 and 575.210, respectively;


(4) Request a waiver from OPM of the limitation on the maximum amount of a relocation incentive under § 575.209(c); and 


(5) Establish the criteria for terminating a service agreement under § 575.211.


(b) *Factors for determining when a position is likely to be difficult to fill.* An agency in its sole and exclusive discretion, subject only to OPM review and oversight, may determine that a position is likely to be difficult to fill if the agency is likely to have difficulty recruiting candidates with the competencies required for the position (or group of positions) in the absence of a relocation incentive. An agency must consider the following factors, as applicable to the case at hand, in determining whether a position (or group of positions) is likely to be difficult to fill in the absence of a relocation incentive and in documenting this determination as required by § 575.208:


(1) The availability and quality of candidates possessing the competencies required for the position, including the success of recent efforts to recruit candidates for the position or similar positions using indicators such as offer acceptance rates, proportion of positions filled, and the length of time required to fill similar positions;


(2) The salaries typically paid outside the Federal Government for similar positions;


(3) Recent turnover in similar positions;


(4) Employment trends and labor-market factors that may affect the agency's ability to recruit candidates for similar positions;


(5) Special or unique competencies required for the position;


(6) Agency efforts to use non-pay authorities, such as special training and work scheduling flexibilities, to resolve difficulties alone or in combination with a relocation incentive;


(7) The desirability of the duties, work or organizational environment, or geographic location of the position; and


(8) Other supporting factors.


(c) An agency may determine that a position (or group of positions) is likely to be difficult to fill if OPM has approved the use of a direct-hire authority applicable to the position (or group of positions) under 5 CFR part 337, subpart B.
