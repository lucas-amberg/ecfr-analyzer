# § 575.212   Internal monitoring requirements and revocation or suspension of authority.

(a) Each agency must monitor the use of relocation incentives to ensure that the agency's relocation incentive plan and the payment of relocation incentives are consistent with the requirements and criteria established under 5 U.S.C. 5753 and this subpart.


(b) When OPM finds that an agency is not paying relocation incentives consistent with the agency's relocation incentive plan and the criteria established under this subpart or otherwise determines that the agency is not using this authority selectively and judiciously, OPM may—


(1) Direct the agency to revoke or suspend the authority granted to any organizational component in the agency and, with respect to any category or categories of employees, require that the component obtain approval from the agency's headquarters level before paying a relocation incentive to such employees; or


(2) Revoke or suspend the authority granted to the agency under this subpart for all or any part of the agency and, with respect to any category or categories of employees, require that the agency obtain OPM's approval before paying a relocation incentive to such employees.
