(a) When legal process is served on a governmental entity, and the individual identified in the legal process as the obligor is found not to be entitled to moneys (the entitlement to which is based upon remuneration for employment) due from, or payable by, the governmental entity, the entity shall follow the procedures set forth in the legal process for that contingency or, if no procedures are set forth therein, shall return the legal process to the court, or other authority from which it was issued, and advise the court, or other authority, that no moneys, the entitlement to which is based upon remuneration for employment, are due from, or payable by, the governmental entity to the named individual.


(b) Where it appears that remuneration for employment is only temporarily exhausted or otherwise unavailable, the court, or other authority, shall be fully advised as to why, and for how long, the remuneration will be unavailable, if that information is known by the governmental entity. 


(c) In instances where an employee obligor separates from his/her employment with a governmental entity which is presently honoring a continuing legal process, the entity shall inform the party who caused the legal process to be served, or the party's representative, and the court, or other authority, that the payments are being discontinued.
