# ยง 591.226   How does OPM apply the CPIs?

(a) OPM uses a three-step process to adjust price indexes by relative annual or biennial changes in the CPIs. For steps 1 and 2, OPM computes the annual change by dividing the CPI from 1 year after the survey by the CPI from the time of the survey. OPM computes the biennial change by dividing the CPI from 2 years after the survey by the CPI from the time of the survey. 


(1) *Step 1.* OPM computes the annual or biennial CPI change for the COLA area. 


(2) *Step 2.* OPM computes the annual or biennial CPI change for the DC area. 


(3) *Step 3.* OPM multiplies the COLA area price index from the last survey by the COLA area CPI change computed in step 1 divided by the DC area CPI change computed in step 2. The adjusted price index is rounded to the second decimal place. 


(b) *Example:*
