# § 630.1008   Accrual of annual and sick leave.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, while an employee is in a shared leave status, annual and sick leave shall accrue to the credit of the employee at the same rate as if the employee were then in a paid leave status under subchapter I of chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code, except that—


(1) The maximum amount of annual leave that may be accrued by a leave recipient while in a shared leave status in connection with any particular medical emergency may not exceed 40 hours (or, in the case of a part-time employee or an employee with an uncommon tour of duty, the average number of hours in the employee's weekly scheduled tour of duty); and


(2) The maximum amount of sick leave that may be accrued by a leave recipient while in a shared leave status in connection with any particular medical emergency may not exceed 40 hours (or, in the case of a part-time employee or an employee with an uncommon tour of duty, the average number of hours in the employee's weekly scheduled tour of duty).


(b) Any annual or sick leave accrued by an employee under this subpart and subpart I of this part—


(1) Shall be credited to an annual or sick leave account, as appropriate, separate from any leave account of the employee under subchapter I of chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code; and 


(2) Shall not become available for use by the employee and may not otherwise be taken into account under subchapter I of chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code, until it is transferred to the appropriate leave account of the employee under subchapter I of chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.


(c) Any annual or sick leave accrued by an employee under this section shall be transferred to the appropriate leave account of the employee under subchapter I of chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code, and shall become available for use—


(1) As of the beginning of the first pay period beginning on or after the date on which the employee's medical emergency terminates as described in § 630.1010(a)(3) or (4); or 


(2) If the employee's medical emergency has not yet terminated, once the employee has exhausted all leave made available to such employee under this subpart of subpart I of this part.


(d) If the leave recipient's employing agency advances at the beginning of the leave year the amount of annual leave the employee normally would accrue during the entire leave year under 5 U.S.C. 6302(d)—


(1) The leave recipient's employing agency shall establish procedures to ensure that 40 hours (or, in the case of a part-time employee or an employee with an uncommon tour of duty, the average number of hours in the employee's weekly scheduled tour of duty) of annual leave are placed in a separate annual leave account and made available for use by the employee as described in paragraph (c) of this section; and


(2) The employee shall continue to accrue annual leave while using annual leave withdrawn from a leave bank to the extent necessary for the purpose of reducing an indebtedness caused by the use of annual leave advanced at the beginning of the leave year.


(e) If the leave recipient's medical emergency terminates as described in § 630.1010(a)(1), no leave shall be credited to the employee under this section.
