# ยง 630.1405   Administration of administrative leave.

(a) An agency must use the same minimum charge increments for administrative leave as it does for annual and sick leave under ยง 630.206.


(b) Employees may be granted administrative leave only for hours within the tour of duty established for purposes of charging annual and sick leave when absent. For full-time employees, that tour is the 40-hour basic workweek as defined in 5 CFR 610.102, the basic work requirement established for employees on a flexible or compressed work schedule as defined in 5 U.S.C. 6121(3), or an uncommon tour of duty under ยง 630.210.


(c) Agencies authorize, and may require, the use of administrative leave by an employee or a category of employees. Employees do not have an entitlement to receive administrative leave, nor do they have a right to refuse administrative leave when the agency requires its use.
