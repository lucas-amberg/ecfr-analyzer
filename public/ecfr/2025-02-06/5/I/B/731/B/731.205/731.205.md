# ยง 731.205   Debarment by agencies in cases involving the competitive service and career Senior Executive Service.

(a) Subject to the provisions of ยง 731.103, when an agency finds an applicant or appointee unsuitable based upon reasons listed in ยง 731.202, the agency may, for a period of not more than 3 years from the date of the unfavorable suitability determination, deny that individual examination for, and appointment to, either all, or specific competitive service positions and career appointment to all, or specific Senior Executive Service positions within that agency.


(b) The agency may impose an additional period of debarment following the expiration of a period of OPM or agency debarment, but only after the individual again becomes an applicant or appointee subject to the agency's suitability jurisdiction, and his or her suitability is determined in accordance with the procedures of this part. An additional debarment period may be based in whole or in part on the same conduct on which the previous suitability action was based, when warranted, or new conduct.


(c) The agency, in its sole discretion, determines the duration of any period of debarment imposed under this section.


(d) The agency is responsible for enforcing the period of debarment and taking appropriate action if an individual applies for a position at that agency during the debarment period or is examined for or appointed to a position at that agency during the debarment period. This responsibility does not limit OPM's authority to exercise jurisdiction itself and take any action OPM deems appropriate.
