The burden is upon the employee to establish the timeliness of the appeal and to explain why the VA's order is in error. OPM's decision is based upon the written record only, which will include the submissions by the employee and the agency. OPM will accept the facts found by the VA regarding the disciplinary or adverse action, or performance-based action, or other type of finding or action, if any, which was relied upon by the VA in making its recoupment decision. OPM may uphold the VA order if the employee or their designated representative fails to provide requested information. OPM's review of the VA order is limited to whether the procedures in VA's policies on recoupment of awards and bonuses pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 721 were followed. In the absence of such policies, OPM's review is limited to compliance with 38 U.S.C. 721.
