# § 838.131   Computation of time.

(a) The rules applicable for computation of time under §§ 831.107 and 841.109 of this chapter apply to this part. 


(b)(1) Appendix A of this subpart lists the proper addresses for submitting court orders affecting CSRS and FERS benefits. 


(2) A former spouse or child abuse creditor should submit the documentation required by this part to the address provided in appendix A of this subpart. The component of OPM responsible for processing court orders will note the date of receipt on court orders that it receives. 


(3) If a court order is delivered to OPM at an address other than the address in appendix A of this subpart, the recipient will forward the court order to the component of OPM responsible for processing court orders. However, OPM is not considered to have received the court order until the court order is received in the component of OPM responsible for processing orders.
