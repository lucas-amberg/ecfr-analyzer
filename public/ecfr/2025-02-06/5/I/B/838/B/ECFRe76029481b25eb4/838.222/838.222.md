(ii) Of the date on which OPM received the court order, the date on which the former spouse's benefit begins to accrue, and if known, the date on which OPM commences payment under the order;


(iii) Of the amount of the former spouse's monthly benefit and the formula OPM used to compute the monthly benefit; and


(iv) That, if he or she disagrees with the amount of the monthly benefits, he or she must obtain, and submit to OPM, an amended court order clarifying the amount; and

(vi) That, if he or she disagrees with the amount of the former spouse's monthly benefits, he or she must obtain, and submit to OPM, an amended court order clarifying the amount.


(b) If OPM receives a court order acceptable for processing that is directed at an employee annuity but the employee has died, or if a retiree or phased retiree dies after payments from the retiree or phased retiree to a former spouse have begun, OPM will inform the former spouse that the employee, or retiree, or phased retiree has died and that OPM can only honor court orders dividing employee annuities during the lifetime of the retiree or phased retiree.

(d) The failure of OPM to provide, or of the employee, separated employee, retiree, phased retiree or the former spouse to receive, the information specified in this section prior to the commencing date of a reduction or accrual does not affect—


(1) The validity of payment under the court order; or
