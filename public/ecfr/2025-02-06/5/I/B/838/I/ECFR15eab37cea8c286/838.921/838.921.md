# § 838.921   Determining the amount of a former spouse survivor annuity.

(a) A court order that contains no provision stating the amount of the former spouse survivor annuity provides the maximum former spouse survivor annuity permitted under § 831.641 or § 842.613 of this chapter and satisfies the requirements of § 838.805.


(b)(1) A court order that provides that “a former spouse will keep” or “an employee or retiree will maintain” the survivor annuity to which he or she was entitled at the time of the divorce satisfies the requirements of § 838.805 and provides a former spouse survivor annuity in the same proportion to the maximum survivor annuity under § 831.641 or § 842.613 of this chapter as the former spouse had at the time of divorce. For example, a former spouse of an employee would be entitled to a maximum survivor benefit; a former spouse of a retiree (who was married to the retiree at retirement and continuously until the divorce resulting in the court order) would be entitled to the survivor benefit elected at retirement.


(2) If, at the time of divorce, the employee covered by FERS had at least 18 months of civilian service creditable under FERS but less than 10 years of service creditable under FERS, a former spouse with a court order described in paragraph (b)(1) or paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be entitled to the basic employee death benefit as defined in § 843.102 of this chapter, but is not entitled to any other former spouse survivor annuity based on the court order.


(c)(1) A court order that awards a former spouse survivor annuity of less than $12 per year satisfies the requirements of § 838.805 and provides an initial rate of $1 per month plus all cost-of-living increases occurring after the later of—


(i) The date of the court order; or


(ii) The date when the employee retires.


(2) The reduction in the employee annuity will be computed as though the court order provided a former spouse survivor annuity of $1 per month.


(d)(1) A court order that awards a former spouse survivor annuity while authorizing the employee or retiree to elect a lesser former spouse survivor annuity upon the employee's or retiree's remarriage satisfies the requirements of § 838.805, and provides the former spouse survivor annuity at the rate initially provided in the court order but does not allow the employee or retiree to elect a lesser benefit for the former spouse.


(2) To provide full survivor annuity benefits to a former spouse while authorizing the employee or retiree to elect a lesser former spouse survivor annuity benefit in order to provide survivor annuity benefits for a subsequent spouse, the court order must provide for a reduction in the former spouse survivor annuity upon the employee's or retiree's election of survivor annuity benefits for a subsequent spouse.


(3) A reduction in the amount of survivor benefits provided to the former spouse does not satisfy the requirements of § 838.805 if it is contingent upon the employee's or annuitant's remarriage rather than his or her election of survivor annuity benefits for a subsequent spouse.
