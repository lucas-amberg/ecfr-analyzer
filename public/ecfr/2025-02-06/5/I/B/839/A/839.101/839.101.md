# ยง 839.101   What is the Federal Erroneous Retirement Coverage Corrections Act?

(a) The Federal Erroneous Retirement Coverage Corrections Act (FERCCA) is Title II of Public Law 106-265, enacted September 19, 2000. The FERCCA addresses the problems created when employees are in the wrong retirement plan for an extended period.


(b) Generally, you must be in the wrong retirement plan for at least 3 years of service after December 31, 1986, before the FERCCA applies to you. Depending on the type of error, the FERCCA provides:


(1) A choice between retirement plans,


(2) New rules for crediting civilian and military service that was not subject to retirement deductions, 


(3) Payment of lost earnings on employee make-up contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan, and 


(4) Payment of certain out-of-pocket expenses that are a direct result of a retirement coverage error.
