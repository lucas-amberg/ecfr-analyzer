# ยง 839.301   What should I do if I am not sure whether I am or was in the wrong retirement plan?

(a) If you are an employee, your employer has your personnel records and will review them to determine whether an error has been made. Therefore, you should notify your employer's human resources office if you believe an error has been made in your case. Notify your current employer even if you believe the error occurred while you were employed at another agency. 


(b) If you are not currently employed by the Federal Government, you should notify OPM at: U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Retirement Operations Center, Post Office Box 45, Boyers, Pennsylvania 16017. You can also contact us by electronic mail at *FERCCA@OPM.GOV.* Notify OPM regardless of whether you are a retiree, survivor, or separated employee. 


(c) You may also get additional information about the FERCCA and whether or not you qualify at: *www.opm.gov/benefits/correction.*
