(a) If your error has not previously been corrected, the 6-month time limit on making an election of retirement coverage under the FERCCA (see ยง 839.611(a)) does not begin to run until you are notified of the error. 


(b) If your error was previously corrected, the 18-month time limit on making an election of retirement coverage ends on September 19, 2002. Employers and OPM may extend the time limit if you were prevented from making a timely election due to a cause beyond your control (see ยง 839.612).
