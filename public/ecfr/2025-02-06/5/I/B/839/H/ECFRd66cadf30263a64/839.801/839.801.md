# ยง 839.801   Do I owe more money if I had a qualifying retirement coverage error and the employee retirement deductions for the new retirement plan are more than what I already paid?

(a) No, your employer is responsible for paying any additional amount to the Fund. Your employer will not bill you for any additional retirement deductions. 


(b) For qualifying retirement coverage errors corrected under this part, the rules at ยง 831.111(b) of this chapter (pertaining to employee options when the employer fails to withhold CSRS or CSRS Offset retirement deductions) do not apply.
