# ยง 839.1004   Are lost earnings payable if I separated or if the employee died?

(a) Yes. If the TSP account is not withdrawn, the lost earnings are paid to the account.


(b) If there is no TSP account at the time the lost earnings are payable, you or your survivors will receive the payment directly.
