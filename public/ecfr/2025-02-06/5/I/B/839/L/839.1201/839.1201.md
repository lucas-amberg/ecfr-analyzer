# ยง 839.1201   If I took legal action against my employer because of a qualifying retirement coverage error, can OPM reimburse me for expenses related to my legal actions?

(a) The FERCCA allows OPM, in its sole discretion, to reimburse you for necessary and reasonable expenses you actually incurred while pursuing a legal or administrative remedy of your qualifying retirement coverage error. 


(b) Necessary and reasonable expenses include actual amounts paid for attorney fees, court costs, expert witness fees, and other litigation expenses. 


(c) You may not receive reimbursement under this section if you received a monetary award that compensated you for your litigation expenses. 


(d) You must support your request for reimbursement with evidence that supports your claim. 


(e) In determining what is a necessary and reasonable expense, OPM will consider: 


(1) The type and amount of the expense; 


(2) The circumstances that gave rise to the expense; and 


(3) Whether the expense is directly related to litigation concerning a retirement coverage error.
