# ยง 839.1202   Can OPM waive repayment of a monetary award I received as resolution of the harm caused me by a qualifying retirement coverage error?

(a) The FERCCA allows OPM, in its sole discretion, to waive repayment of all or part of a settlement payment or court-ordered payment if you can demonstrate that CSRS Offset coverage does not fully compensate you for your losses. 


(b) Your request for waiver must state why you believe waiver of repayment is appropriate and include any evidence that supports your request.
