(c) You must substantiate your claim for losses with any evidence that supports your request. 


(d) OPM cannot pay you for: 


(1) Claimed losses related to forgone contributions and earnings under the TSP, other than lost earnings on make-up contributions to the TSP as provided in subpart J of this part; and
