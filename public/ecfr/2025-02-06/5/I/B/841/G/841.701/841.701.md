# § 841.701   Purpose and scope.

(a) The purpose of this subpart is to regulate computation of cost-of-living adjustments (COLA's) for basic benefits under the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS).


(b) This subpart provides the methodology for—


(1) Computing COLA's on each type of FERS basic benefit subject to COLA's; and


(2) Computing COLA's on annuities partially computed under FERS and partially computed under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS).


(c) COLA's on children's annuities are not covered by this subpart because COLA's on children's annuities are computed under CSRS rules.
