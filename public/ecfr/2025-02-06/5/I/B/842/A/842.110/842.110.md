# § 842.110   Continuation of coverage for food service employees of the House of Representatives or the Senate Restaurants.

(a) *Election.* Congressional employees who were covered by FERS and provide food service operations for the House of Representatives or the Senate Restaurants can elect to continue their FERS retirement coverage when such food service operations are transferred to a private contractor. These regulations also apply to any successor contractors.


(b) *Eligibility requirements.* To be eligible for continuation of retirement coverage, an employee must:


(1)(i) Be a Congressional employee (as defined in sec. 2107 of title 5, United States Code), other than an employee of the Architect of the Capitol, engaged in providing food service operations for the House of Representatives under the administrative control of the Architect of the Capitol; or


(ii) Be a Senate Restaurants employee who is an employee of the Architect of the Capitol on July 17, 2008;

(3) Elect to remain covered under FERS retirement provisions no later than the day before the date on which the food service operations transfer from the House of Representatives or the Senate Restaurants to a private contractor; and


(4) Become employed to provide food services under contract without a break in service. A “break in service” means a separation from employment of at least three calendar days.

(d) *Employer contributions.* The employer providing food services under contract must, in accordance with procedures established by OPM, pay into the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund amounts equal to any agency contributions under 5 U.S.C. 8423 that would be required if the individual were a Congressional employee covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System.
