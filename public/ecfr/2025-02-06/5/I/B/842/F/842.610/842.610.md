# § 842.610   Changes of election after final adjudication.

(a) Except as provided in § 842.611, § 842.612, or paragraph (b) of this section, an employee or Member may not revoke or change the election or name another survivor later than 30 days after the date of the first regular monthly payment.


(b)(1) Except as provided in § 842.605 and paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, a retiree who was married at the time of retirement and has elected a self-only annuity, a one-half reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity, a fully reduced annuity or a one-half reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity, or an insurable interest rate may elect, no later than 18 months after the time of retirement, an annuity reduction or an increased annuity reduction to provide a current spouse annuity.


(2) A current spouse annuity based on an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section cannot be paid if it will, when combined with any former spouse annuity or annuities that are required by court order, exceed the maximum survivor annuity permitted under § 842.613.


(3) To make an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the retiree must pay, in full no later than 18 months after the time of retirement, a deposit equal to the sum of the monthly differences between the annuity paid to the retiree and the annuity that would have been paid if the additional annuity reduction elected under paragraph (b)(1) of this section had been in effect since the time of retirement, plus—


(i) If the election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section changes the annuity from a self only annuity to a fully reduced annuity, 24.5 percent of the retiree's annual annuity, plus 6 percent interest on both; or


(ii) If the election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section changes the annuity from a self only annuity to a one-half reduced annuity or from a one-half reduced annuity to a fully reduced annuity, 12.25 percent of the retiree's annual annuity, plus 6 percent interest on both.


(4) If a retiree makes an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section and is prevented from paying the deposit within the 18-month time limit because OPM did not send him or her a notice of the amount of the deposit at least 30 days before the time limit expires, the time limit for making the deposit will be extended 30 days after OPM sends the notice of the amount of the deposit. 


(5) An election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section cancels any spousal consent under § 842.603. 


(6) An election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is void unless filed with OPM before the retiree dies. 


(7) If a retiree who had elected a fully reduced annuity or a one-half reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity (or annuities) makes an election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section which would cause the combined current spouse annuity and former spouse annuity (or annuities) to exceed the maximum allowed under § 842.613, the former spouse annuity (or annuities) must be reduced to not exceed the maximum allowable under § 842.613.
