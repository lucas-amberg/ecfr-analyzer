# § 847.607   Methodology for determining the present value of annuity without service credit—credit needed for title.

(a) If credit for the NAFI service is necessary to provide title to an annuity payable on the date of computation under § 847.603, OPM will determine the present value of the annuity without credit for the NAFI service under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.


(b)(1) In cases in which the annuity is payable to a retiree, the present value under paragraph (a) of this section equals the present value of the deferred annuity without credit for the NAFI service as of the deferred annuity date discounted for interest to that date determined under § 847.603.


(2) The present value of the deferred annuity without credit for the NAFI service as of the deferred annuity date equals the retiree's monthly annuity rate without credit for the NAFI service as of the deferred annuity date times the present value factor for the retiree's age on that date.


(3) The present value under paragraph (b)(2) of this section is discounted for interest by dividing that amount by a factor equal to the value of exponential function in which—


(i) The base is one plus the assumed interest rate under § 841.405 of this chapter on the date determined under § 847.603, and


(ii) The exponent is one-twelfth of the number of months between the date determined under § 847.603 and the deferred annuity date.


(c) In cases in which the annuity is payable to a survivor, the present value under paragraph (a) of this section equals zero, that is, no survivor annuity would ever become payable without credit for the NAFI service.
