# § 848.202   Working percentage and officially established hours for phased employment.

(a) For the purpose of this subpart, *working percentage* means the percentage of full-time equivalent employment equal to the quotient obtained by dividing—


(1) The number of officially established hours per pay period to be worked by a phased retiree, as described in paragraph (b) of this section; by


(2) The number of hours per pay period to be worked by an employee serving in a comparable position on a full-time basis.


(b) The number of officially established hours per pay period to be worked by an employee in phased retirement status must equal one-half the number of hours the phased retiree would have been scheduled to work had the phased retiree remained in a full-time work schedule and not elected to enter phased retirement status. These hours make up the officially established part-time work schedule of the phased retiree and exclude any additional hours worked under § 848.205(j).
