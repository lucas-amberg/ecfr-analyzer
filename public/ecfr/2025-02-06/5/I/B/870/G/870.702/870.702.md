# § 870.702   Amount of Basic insurance.

(a) The amount of Basic insurance an annuitant or compensationer can continue is the BIA on the date insurance would otherwise have stopped because of the individual's separation from service or completion of 12 months in nonpay status. The amount of Basic insurance in force is the BIA minus any reductions applicable under § 870.703(a).


(b)(1) For the purpose of paying benefits upon the death of an insured individual under age 45 who is retired or receiving compensation, the BIA will be multiplied by the appropriate age factor shown in § 870.202(c) of this part. Exceptions:


(i) If the insured individual retired or became insured as a compensationer before October 10, 1980, or


(ii) If the insured individual elected a partial Living Benefit as an employee under subpart K of this part.


(2)(i) For an annuitant or compensationer who elected a partial Living Benefit as an employee, the amount of Basic insurance he or she can continue is the post-election BIA, as described in § 870.203(a)(2).


(ii) If an employee elected a partial Living Benefit and that employee is under age 45 at the time of death, OFEGLI will multiply the post-election BIA by the appropriate factor, as specified in § 870.202(c), that was in effect on the date that is nine months after the date OFEGLI received the completed Living Benefit application.
