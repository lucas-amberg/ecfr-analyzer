# ยง 870.703   Election of Basic insurance.

(a) An individual who makes an election under ยง 870.701(c) and who has not elected a Living Benefit must select one of the options in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section. No one else can make this election on the individual's behalf.


(1) *Termination of the insurance.* The individual's insurance stops upon conversion to an individual policy as provided under ยง 870.603. If the individual does not convert to an individual policy, insurance stops at the end of the month in which OPM or the employing office receives the election;


(2) *Continuation or reinstatement of Basic insurance with a maximum reduction of 75 percent during retirement.* Premiums are withheld from annuity or compensation (except as provided under ยง 870.401(d)(1)). The amount of Basic Life insurance in force reduces by 2 percent of the BIA each month until the maximum reduction is reached. This reduction starts at the beginning of the 2nd month after the date the insurance would otherwise have stopped or the date of the insured's 65th birthday, whichever is later;


(3) *Continuation or reinstatement of Basic insurance with a maximum reduction of 50 percent during retirement.* Premiums are withheld from annuity or compensation. The amount of Basic insurance in force reduces by 1 percent of the BIA each month until the maximum reduction is reached. This reduction starts at the beginning of the 2nd month after the date the insurance would otherwise have stopped or the date of the insured's 65th birthday, whichever is later; or


(4) *Continuation or reinstatement of Basic insurance with no reduction after age 65.* Premiums are withheld from annuity or compensation.


(b)(1) Unless an employee has elected a partial Living Benefit under subpart K of this part or an individual has assigned the insurance under subpart I of this part, an insured individual may cancel an election under paragraph (a)(3) or (a)(4) of this section at any time. The amount of Basic insurance automatically switches to the amount that would have been in force if the individual had originally elected the 75 percent reduction. This revised amount is effective at the end of the month in which OPM receives the request to cancel the previous election. There is no refund of premiums.


(2) If an individual files a waiver of insurance, the coverage stops without a 31-day extension of coverage or conversion right. Coverage ceases at the end of the month in which OPM received the waiver.


(c) Unless he/she chooses to terminate his/her insurance, an employee who has elected a partial Living Benefit must choose the no reduction election under paragraph (a)(4) of this section. The employee cannot later change to the 75 percent reduction.


(d) If an employee has assigned his or her insurance, he/she cannot cancel an election under paragraph (a)(3) or (a)(4) of this section. Only the assignee(s) may cancel this election. Exception: If the employee elected a partial Living Benefit before assigning the remainder of his or her insurance, the assignee(s) cannot cancel the election under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.


(e)(1) For purposes of this part, a judge who retires under paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (vii) of this section is considered to be an employee after retirement:


(ii) 28 U.S.C. 372(a);


(iii) 28 U.S.C. 377;


(iv) 26 U.S.C. 7447;


(v) 11 DC Code 776;


(vi) Section 7447 of the Internal Revenue Code;




(vii) 38 U.S.C. 7296;




(2) The insurance of a judge described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section does not reduce after age 65. Basic insurance continues without interruption or reduction. *Exception:* If the insured is a judge eligible for compensation, and chooses to receive compensation instead of annuity, he or she must select an option described in paragraph (a) of this section.
