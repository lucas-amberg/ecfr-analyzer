# ยง 875.210   What happens if I become ineligible after I submit an application?

(a) You must be eligible at the time of your application and at the time your coverage is scheduled to go into effect. Except as noted in paragraph (b) of this section, if you lose your status as part of an eligible group before your coverage goes into effect, you are no longer eligible for FLTCIP coverage. You are required to inform the Carrier that you are no longer eligible.


(b) In two instances, you will continue to be eligible for coverage even if you lose your status as part of an eligible group after you submit an application for coverage, but before your coverage becomes effective. The two instances are:




(1) When you are involuntarily separated from Federal civilian service (except for misconduct) or from the uniformed services (except for a dishonorable discharge); or, when you are the qualified relative of a workforce member who has been involuntarily separated from Federal civilian service (except for misconduct) or from the uniformed services (except for a dishonorable discharge).




(2) When you are the qualified relative of a workforce member who dies.
