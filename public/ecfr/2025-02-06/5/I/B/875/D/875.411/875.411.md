# ยง 875.411   May I continue my coverage when I am no longer a qualified relative?

If you are already enrolled as a qualified relative, you may continue your FLTCIP coverage if you subsequently lose qualified relative status (such as upon divorce), as long as the Carrier receives the required premium when due.
