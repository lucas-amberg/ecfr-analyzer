# ยง 890.109   Exclusion of certain periods of eligibility when determining continued coverage during retirement.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, periods during which temporary employees are eligible under 5 U.S.C. 8906a to receive health benefits by enrolling and paying the full subscription charge, but are not eligible to participate in a retirement system, are not considered when determining eligibility for continued coverage during retirement. For the purpose of continuing coverage during retirement, an employee is considered to have enrolled at his or her first opportunity if the employee registered to be enrolled when he or she received a permanent appointment entitling him or her to participate in a retirement system and to receive the Government contribution toward the health benefits premium payments.


(b) A temporary employee eligible under 5 U.S.C. 8906a may continue enrollment as a compensationer if he or she has been enrolled or covered as a family member under another enrollment under this part for:


(1) The 5 years of service immediately preceding the commencement of his or her monthly compensation; or


(2) During all periods of service since his or her first opportunity to enroll, if less than 5 years. For the purpose of this paragraph, an employee is considered to have enrolled at his or her first opportunity if the employee registered to be enrolled when he or she first became eligible under 5 U.S.C. 8906a.
