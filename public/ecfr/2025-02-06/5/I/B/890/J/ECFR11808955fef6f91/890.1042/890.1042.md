# ยง 890.1042   Effective dates of debarments.

(a) *Minimum notice period.* A debarment shall take effect not sooner than 30 days after the date of OPM's notice of proposed debarment, unless the debarring official specifically determines that the health or safety of covered individuals or the integrity of the FEHBP warrants an earlier effective date. In such a situation, the notice shall specifically inform the provider that the debarring official decided to shorten or eliminate the 30-day notice period. 


(b) *Uncontested debarments.* If a provider does not file a contest within the 30-day notice period, the proposed debarment shall take effect on the date stated in the notice of proposed debarment, without further procedures, actions, or notice by OPM. 


(c) *Contested debarments and requests for reducing the period of debarment.* If a provider files a contest within the 30-day notice period, the proposed debarment shall not go into effect until the debarring official issues a final written decision, unless the health or safety of covered individuals or the integrity of the FEHBP requires the debarment to be effective while the contest is pending.
