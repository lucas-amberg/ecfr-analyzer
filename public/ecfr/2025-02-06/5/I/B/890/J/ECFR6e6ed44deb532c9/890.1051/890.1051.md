# ยง 890.1051   Applying for reinstatement when period of debarment expires.

(a) *Application required.* Reinstatement is not automatic when the minimum period of a provider's debarment expires. The provider shall apply in writing to OPM, supplying specific information about the reinstatement criteria outlined in paragraph (c) of this section. 


(b) *Reinstatement date.* A debarred provider may submit a reinstatement application not earlier than 60 days before the nominal expiration date of the debarment. However, in no case shall OPM reinstate a provider before the minimum period of debarment expires. 


(c) *Reinstatement criteria.* To be approved, the provider's reinstatement application shall clearly demonstrate that: 


(1) There are reasonable assurances that the actions resulting in the provider's debarment have not recurred and will not recur; 


(2) There is no basis under this subpart for continuing the provider's debarment; and 


(3) There is no pending criminal, civil, or administrative action that would subject the provider to debarment by OPM. 


(d) *Written notice of OPM action.* OPM shall inform the provider in writing of its decision regarding the reinstatement application. 


(e) *Limitation on reapplication.* If OPM denies a provider's reinstatement application, the provider is not eligible to reapply for 1 year after the date of the denial.
