# ยง 890.1031   Grounds for suspension.

(a) *Basis for suspension.* OPM may suspend a provider if: 


(1) OPM obtains reliable evidence indicating that one of the grounds for suspension listed in paragraph (b) of this section applies to the provider; and 


(2) The suspending official determines under paragraph (c) of this section that immediate action to suspend the provider is necessary to protect the health and safety of persons covered by FEHBP. 


(b) *Grounds for suspension.* Evidence constituting grounds for a suspension may include, but is not limited to: 


(1) Indictment or conviction of a provider for a criminal offense that is a basis for mandatory debarment under this subpart; 


(2) Indictment or conviction of a provider for a criminal offense that reflects a risk to the health, safety, or well-being of FEHBP-covered individuals; 


(3) Other credible evidence indicating, in the judgment of the suspending official, that a provider has committed a violation that would warrant debarment under this subpart. This may include, but is not limited to: 


(i) Civil judgments; 


(ii) Notice that a Federal, State, or local government agency has debarred, suspended, or excluded a provider from participating in a program or revoked or declined to renew a professional license; or 


(iii) Other official findings by Federal, State, or local bodies that determine factual or legal matters. 


(c) *Determining need for immediate action.* Suspension is intended to protect the public interest, including the health and safety of covered individuals or the integrity of FEHBP funds. The suspending official has wide discretion to decide whether to suspend a provider. A specific finding of immediacy or necessity is not required to issue a suspension. The suspending official may draw reasonable inferences from the nature of the alleged misconduct and from a provider's actual or potential transactions with the FEHBP.
