(a) *Covered individual admitted before debarment or suspension.* If a covered person is admitted as an inpatient before the effective date of an institutional provider's debarment or suspension, that provider may continue to receive payment of FEHBP funds for inpatient institutional services until the covered person is released or transferred, unless the debarring or suspending official terminates payments under paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) *Health and safety of covered individuals.* If the debarring or suspending official determines that the health and safety of covered persons would be at risk if they remain in a debarred or suspended institution, OPM may terminate FEHBP payments at any time.


(c) *Notice of payment limitations.* If OPM limits any payment under paragraph (b) of this section, it must immediately send written notice of its action to the institutional provider.


(d) *Finality of debarring or suspending official's decision.* The debarring or suspending official's decision to limit or deny payments under paragraph (b) of this section is not subject to administrative review or reconsideration.
