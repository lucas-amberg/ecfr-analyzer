# ยง 890.1013   Deciding whether to propose a permissive debarment.

(a) *Review factors.* The factors OPM shall consider in deciding whether to propose a provider's debarment under a permissive debarment authority are: 


(1) The nature of any claims involved in the basis for the proposed debarment and the circumstances under which they were presented to FEHBP carriers; 


(2) The improper conduct involved in the basis for the proposed debarment, and the provider's degree of culpability and history of prior offenses; 


(3) The extent to which the provider poses or may pose a risk to the health and safety of FEHBP-covered individuals or to the integrity of FEHBP transactions; and 


(4) Other factors specifically relevant to the provider's debarment that shall be considered in the interests of fairness. 


(b) *Absence of a factor.* The absence of a factor shall be considered neutral, and shall have no effect on OPM's decision. 


(c) *Specialized review in certain cases.* In determining whether to propose debarment under 5 U.S.C 8902a(c)(4) for providing items or services substantially in excess of the needs of a covered individual or for providing items or services that fail to meet professionally-recognized quality standards, OPM shall obtain the input of trained reviewers, based on written medical protocols developed by physicians. If OPM cannot reach a decision on this basis, it shall consult with a physician in an appropriate specialty area.
