# ยง 890.1023   Information considered in deciding a contest.

(a) *Documents and oral and written arguments.* A provider may submit documents and written arguments in opposition to the proposed debarment and/or the length of the proposed debarment, and may appear personally or through a representative before the debarring official to provide other relevant information. 


(b) *Specific factual basis for contesting the proposed debarment.* A provider's oral and written arguments shall identify the specific facts that contradict the basis for the proposed debarment as stated in the notice of proposed debarment. A general or unsupported denial of the basis for debarment does not raise a genuine dispute over facts material to the debarment, and the debarring official shall not give such a denial any probative weight. 


(c) *Mandatory disclosures.* Regardless of the basis for the contest, providers are required to disclose certain types of background information, in addition to any other information submitted during the contest. Failure to provide such information completely and accurately may be a basis for OPM to initiate further legal or administrative action against the provider. The specific items of information that shall be furnished to OPM are: 


(1) Any existing, proposed, or prior exclusion, debarment, penalty, or other sanction imposed on the provider by a Federal, State, or local government agency, including any administrative agreement that purports to affect only a single agency; 


(2) Any criminal or civil legal proceeding not referenced in the notice of proposed debarment that arose from facts relevant to the basis for debarment stated in the notice; and 


(3) Any entity in which the provider has a control interest, as that term is defined in ยง 890.1003.
