# ยง 890.1417   No continuation of FEHB enrollment into retirement from employment with a tribal employer.

(a) An FEHB enrollment cannot be continued into retirement from employment with a tribal employer.


(b) A Federal annuitant may continue FEHB enrollment into retirement from Federal service if the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 8905(b) for carrying FEHB coverage into retirement are satisfied through enrollment, or coverage as a family member, either through a Federal employing office or a tribal employer, or any combination thereof.


(c) A Federal annuitant who is employed after retirement by a tribal employer in an FEHB eligible position may participate in FEHB through the tribal employer. In such a case, the Federal annuitant's retirement system will transfer the FEHB enrollment to the tribal employer, in a similar manner as for a Federal annuitant who is employed by a Federal agency after retirement.


(d) A tribal employee who becomes a survivor annuitant as described in ยง 890.303(d)(2) is entitled to reinstatement of health benefits coverage as a Federal employee would under the same circumstances.
