# § 890.1605   Enrollment in the initial contract year.

(a) *Definitions.* In this section—


*Current enrollment type* means the type of coverage (self only, self plus one, or self and family) of the FEHB plan in which the individual is enrolled during the contract year immediately preceding the initial contract year;


*Current option* with respect to an individual, means the option under a FEHB plan in which the individual is enrolled during the contract year immediately preceding the initial contract year; and


*Current plan* means, with respect to an individual, the FEHB plan in which the individual is enrolled during the contract year immediately preceding the initial contract year.


(b) *Transitional Open Season.* (1) During the Open Season that immediately precedes the initial contract year (*i.e.,* the transitional Open Season), a Postal Service employee or Postal Service annuitant—


(i) May elect to enroll or elect not to enroll in a PSHB plan; and


(ii) Will not be enrolled or continue enrollment in an FEHB plan under this part as a Postal Service employee or a Postal Service annuitant.


(2) A Postal Service employee or Postal Service annuitant who is eligible to enroll in a PSHB plan and is enrolled in an FEHB plan but who does not make an election during the transitional Open Season either to enroll in a PSHB plan or not to enroll in a PSHB plan will be automatically enrolled in a PSHB plan pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.


(3) During the transitional Open Season, a Postal Service employee in a nonpay status, such as leave without pay, except for the case of a 365-day period of nonpay status as set forth at § 890.303(e), may enroll in a PSHB plan or may be automatically enrolled in a PSHB plan pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.


(c) *Automatic enrollment.* Each Postal Service employee or Postal Service annuitant who is enrolled in an FEHB plan on December 31, 2024, and does not make an enrollment action during the transitional Open Season under paragraph (b) of this section, will be automatically enrolled in the PSHB Program as follows:


(1) *Into corresponding plan.* Individuals enrolled in a carrier's 2024 FEHB plan where the carrier offers the same plan in 2025 in FEHB and offers a 2025 PSHB plan with at least one option that has equivalent benefits and cost sharing and in the same geographic area as the 2025 FEHB plan, will be enrolled in that 2025 PSHB plan and into an option as follows:


(i) *Equivalent option.* Individuals enrolled in a carrier's 2024 FEHB option where the carrier offers that option in 2025 in FEHB and also offers a 2025 PSHB option with equivalent benefits and cost sharing as the 2025 FEHB option, as determined by OPM, will be automatically enrolled into that 2025 PSHB option; or


(ii) *No equivalent option.* Individuals enrolled in a carrier's 2024 FEHB option where the carrier does not offer a 2025 PSHB option that meets the criteria in (1)(i), will be automatically enrolled into the lowest-cost option of the 2025 PSHB plan, that is not a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) and does not charge an association or membership fee, except that if the only option is an HDHP, then the individual will be enrolled in that HDHP option.


(2) *Into a 2025 PSHB plan where the carrier offers no 2025 FEHB plan.* Individuals enrolled in a carrier's 2024 FEHB plan where the carrier offers no 2025 FEHB plan and offers a 2025 PSHB plan with at least one option with similar benefits and cost sharing and in the same geographic area as the 2024 FEHB plan, as determined by OPM, will be enrolled in that 2025 PSHB plan and into an option as follows:


(i) *Similar option.* Individuals enrolled in a carrier's 2024 FEHB option where the carrier offers a 2025 PSHB option with similar benefits and cost sharing as the 2024 FEHB option, as determined by OPM, will be automatically enrolled into that 2025 PSHB option; or


(ii) *No similar option.* Individuals enrolled in a carrier's 2024 FEHB option where the carrier does not offer a 2025 PSHB option that meets the criteria in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, will be automatically enrolled into the lowest-cost option of the 2025 PSHB plan, or in the case where the 2025 PSHB plan has two or more options, into the lowest-cost option that is not a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) and does not charge an association or membership fee.


(3) *Into different plan.* Individuals enrolled in a carrier's 2024 FEHB plan where paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section do not apply will be enrolled in the lowest-cost nationwide PSHB option, consistent with § 890.301(n).


(4) *Same enrollment type.* Individuals automatically enrolled under this section will be automatically enrolled into the same enrollment type as the individual's 2024 enrollment type.


(d) *Automatic enrollment—effect on family members.* A Postal Service employee or Postal Service annuitant automatically enrolled under paragraph (c) of this section will be enrolled in the same enrollment type they were enrolled in immediately preceding the initial contract year. The enrollee's family member(s), if eligible, will be covered under the same enrollment type they were covered under immediately preceding the initial contract year.


(1) A self plus one enrollment will cover the same eligible family member as in the current plan. Automatic enrollment does not verify eligibility of family members. The enrollee must make an affirmative enrollment change to remove an ineligible family member and may replace them with an eligible family member or change the enrollment to a self only or to a self and family enrollment type. Failure to affirmatively change an automatic enrollment to remove an ineligible family member from a self plus one enrollment will result in coverage only for the enrollee but premium withholding for a self plus one enrollment.


(2) A self and family enrollment will include all eligible members of family. Automatic enrollment does not verify identity of eligible family members. The enrollee must affirmatively notify the PSHB Carrier, employing office, or OPM of any changes to members of family.


(e) *Belated enrollment and enrollment changes.* Belated enrollments and enrollment changes will be permitted as follows:


(1) In general, belated enrollments or belated enrollment changes are permitted in accordance with § 890.301(c) for Postal Service employees and § 890.306(c) for Postal Service annuitants.


(2) Any individuals who should have been automatically enrolled pursuant to this section but were not, are deemed to have met the requirement to show that they were unable to enroll for cause beyond their control.


(3) OPM may, in its discretion, deem other individuals or groups of individuals to have met the requirement to show that they were unable to enroll for cause beyond their control.


(4) Unless required to be a prospective change by governing premium conversion under part 892 of this chapter, a belated Open Season enrollment or enrollment change, coverage, and premium obligation take effect on January 1 of the contract year.
