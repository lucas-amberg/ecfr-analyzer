# ยง 894.105   Who may correct an error in my enrollment?

(a) The *Administrator* may correct administrative errors about the processing of your enrollment or changes in enrollment.




(b) OPM may order correction of an administrative error or other noncompliance with FEDVIP rules in this part if it receives evidence that it would be against equity (fairness) and good conscience not to order the correction. Corrections are made at the discretion of OPM and are not subject to review.




(c) If the correction gives you or a *family member* retroactive coverage, you must pay the premiums for all periods of the retroactive coverage. Retroactive premiums will not be on a pre-tax basis (they are not subject to premium conversion).
