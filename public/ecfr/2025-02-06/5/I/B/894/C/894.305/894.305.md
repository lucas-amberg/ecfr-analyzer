# ยง 894.305   Am I eligible to enroll if I am a former spouse receiving an apportionment of annuity?

No. Former spouses receiving an apportionment of annuity are not eligible to enroll in FEDVIP. However, a *TEI former spouse* is eligible to enroll in a FEDVIP vision plan as long as he or she remains unremarried.
