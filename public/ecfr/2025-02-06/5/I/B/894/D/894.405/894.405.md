(a) If your pay, *annuity*, or *compensation* is too low to cover the premium allotments, or if you go into a nonpay status, contact the *Administrator* to arrange to pay your premiums directly to the *Administrator*.


(b) If you do not make the premium payments, your FEDVIP coverage will stop. You will not be able to reenroll until the next open season after:


(1) You are in pay status; or


(2) Your pay is sufficient to make the premium allotments.




(c) If you are a FEDVIP *enrollee*, who due to a lapse in appropriations is furloughed or excepted from furlough and working without pay due to such a lapse, your FEDVIP coverage will not stop during such a lapse. Upon the end of such a lapse, premiums will be paid to the Carrier from back pay made available as soon as practicable upon the end of such a lapse.
