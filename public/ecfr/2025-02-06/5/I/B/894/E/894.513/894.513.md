# ยง 894.513   Do I have to elect FEDVIP coverage each year in order to remain covered?

No. If you do not change or cancel your enrollment, and if your enrollment does not terminate pursuant to this part, then your current enrollment will continue into the next year. Before open season, you should review the plan brochure for any changes in benefits and premiums for the next year.
