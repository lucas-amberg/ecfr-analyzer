# ยง 894.603   Is there a temporary extension of coverage and conversion right when my coverage stops or when a covered family member loses eligibility?

No. There is no temporary extension of coverage, or Temporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC), or right to convert to an individual dental or vision policy when your FEDVIP coverage stops or when a *family member* or *TEI family member* loses eligibility under FEDVIP.
