(a) If you have FEDVIP coverage as an *annuitant,* and you become reemployed in an eligible position in Federal service or United States Postal Service, you must contact the *Administrator* so it can send the request for allotments to your agency so your agency can start making the allotments from your pay.




(b) If you did not enroll in FEDVIP coverage as an *annuitant* and become reemployed in an eligible Federal position or United States Postal Service, you have 60 *days* to enroll in FEDVIP.


(c) If you enroll as an *employee* the *Administrator* will stop sending requests for allotments from your annuity.


(d) If your reemployment terminates, you must notify the *Administrator* within 30 days to have your allotments withheld from your annuity payments. Otherwise, your FEDVIP coverage will terminate due to non-payment of premiums.
