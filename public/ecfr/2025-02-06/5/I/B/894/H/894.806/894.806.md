# ยง 894.806   Can a retiree or Retired Reserve member enroll and cover TEI family members in a FEDVIP dental plan?

Generally, yes, since a retiree or Retired Reserve member who is a *sponsor* is also a *TEI-D.* However, if a retiree or Retired Reserve member who is eligible to enroll does not in fact enroll, then the member is not an *enrollee* and cannot cover *TEI family members.* A *TEI certifying family member* may serve as *enrollee* only if the member does not enroll and meets at least one of the following conditions:


(a) Receives VA dental services;


(b) Has employer-sponsored dental coverage without a family coverage option; or


(c) Has a medical or dental condition that prevents him or her from obtaining dental benefits. *See* description of eligibility in ยง 894.309(a)(3)(iii).
