# ยง 894.811   I am a TEI family member of a sponsor who is a retiree or Retired Reserve member who is not on active duty. My sponsor is a TEI-D but is not enrolled in a FEDVIP dental plan. Can I enroll in a FEDVIP dental plan even though my sponsor is eligible to enroll but is not enrolled?

Generally, if your *sponsor* is a *TEI-D,* he or she must enroll in a FEDVIP dental plan in order to cover *TEI family members.* As an exception, however, a *TEI family member* can accept the responsibility to self-certify and enroll in a FEDVIP dental plan as a *TEI certifying family member,* and cover other *TEI family members,* if the *sponsor* who is a *TEI-D* (eligible for FEDVIP dental benefits) is not enrolled and the *sponsor* meets at least one of the following conditions identified in ยง 894.309(a)(3)(iii):


(a) The retiree *sponsor* receives VA dental services;


(b) The retiree *sponsor* has employer-sponsored dental coverage without a family coverage option; or


(c) The retiree *sponsor* has a medical or dental condition that prevents him or her from obtaining dental benefits.
