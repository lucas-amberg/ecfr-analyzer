No. A widow or widower who is a *TEI family member* is the *TEI certifying family member.* Because there is no available *sponsor,* you are the *enrollee,* and must either:


(a) Enroll yourself and the *TEI child* in a self plus one enrollment; or


(b) Enroll all *TEI family members* in a self and family enrollment, in order for the *TEI child* to receive FEDVIP coverage.
