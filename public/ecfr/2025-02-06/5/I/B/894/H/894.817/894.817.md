# ยง 894.817   If I am a retiree who is a TEI-V and I return to active duty, what happens to my TEI family members' enrollment in their FEDVIP vision plan?

If you and your *TEI family members* are enrolled in a FEDVIP vision plan while you are retired, and you return to active duty, you will no longer be eligible to enroll in a FEDVIP vision plan and cannot continue to be the *enrollee* even though you are the *sponsor.* The current enrollment for you and your *TEI family members* will terminate and your coverage stops at the end of the pay period for which the premium payment was made from your uniformed services retirement pay. A *TEI certifying family member* may accept responsibility to self-certify as the *enrollee* by enrolling and, if appropriate, covering other *TEI family members.* You are responsible for notifying your covered *TEI family members* that your enrollment will terminate and of their opportunity to accept responsibility to self-certify as the *enrollee.* Once the *TEI certifying family member* enrolls, and covers your *TEI family members,* they can remain enrolled in a FEDVIP vision plan for the duration of your active duty service. *See* ยง 894.601.
