# § 919.145   Does this part address persons who are disqualified, as well as those who are excluded from nonprocurement transactions?

Except if provided for in Subpart J of this part, this part— 


(a) Addresses disqualified persons only to— 


(1) Provide for their inclusion in the *EPLS;* and 


(2) State responsibilities of Federal agencies and participants to check for disqualified persons before entering into covered transactions. 


(b) Does not specify the— 


(1) OPM transactions for which a disqualified person is ineligible. Those transactions vary on a case-by-case basis, because they depend on the language of the specific statute, Executive order, or regulation that caused the disqualification; 


(2) Entities to which the disqualification applies; or 


(3) Process that the agency uses to disqualify a person. Unlike exclusion, disqualification is frequently not a discretionary action that a Federal agency takes.
