# ยง 1201.36   Consolidating and joining appeals.

(a) *Explanation.* (1) Consolidation occurs when the appeals of two or more parties are united for consideration because they contain identical or similar issues. For example, individual appeals rising from a single reduction in force might be consolidated.


(2) Joinder occurs when one person has filed two or more appeals and they are united for consideration. For example, a judge might join an appeal challenging a 30-day suspension with a pending appeal challenging a subsequent removal if the same appellant filed both appeals.


(b) *Action by judge.* A judge may consolidate or join cases on his or her own motion or on the motion of a party if doing so would:


(1) Expedite processing of the cases; and


(2) Not adversely affect the interests of the parties.


(c) Any objection to a motion for consolidation or joinder must be filed within 10 days of the date of service of the motion.
