(b) *Judicial review.* The Board's decision will become judicially reviewable on:


(1) The date on which the decision is issued, if the appellant does not file a petition with the Commission under 5 U.S.C. 7702(b)(1); or


(2) The date of the Commission's decision that it will not consider the petition filed under 5 U.S.C. 7702(b)(2).


(c) *Commission processing and time limits.* If the Commission decides to consider the decision of the Board, within 60 days after making its decision it will complete its consideration and either:


(1) Concur in the decision of the Board; or


(2) Issue in writing and forward to the Board for its action under ยง 1201.162 of this subpart another decision, which differs from the decision of the Board to the extent that the Commission finds that, as a matter of law:


(i) The decision of the Board constitutes an incorrect interpretation of any provision of any law, rule, regulation, or policy directive related to prohibited discrimination; or


(ii) The evidence in the record as a whole does not support the decision involving that provision.


(d) *Transmittal of record.* The Board will transmit a copy of its record to the Commission upon request.


(e) *Development of additional evidence.* When asked by the Commission to do so, the Board or a judge will develop additional evidence necessary to supplement the record.
