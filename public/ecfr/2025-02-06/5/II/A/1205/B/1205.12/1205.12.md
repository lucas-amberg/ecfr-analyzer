(a) *Board determinations.* The Board will acknowledge the request for access to records and make a determination on whether to grant it within 20 workdays after it receives the request, except under the unusual circumstances described below:


(1) When the Board needs to obtain the records from other Board offices or a Federal Records Center;


(2) When it needs to obtain and examine a large number of records;


(3) When it needs to consult with another agency that has a substantial interest in the records requested; or


(4) When other extenuating circumstances prevent the Board from processing the request within the 20-day period.


(b) *Time extensions.* When unusual circumstances exist, the Board may extend the time for making a determination on the request for no more than 10 additional workdays. If it does so, it will notify the requester of the extension.


(c) *Improper request.* If a request or an appeal is not properly labeled, does not contain the necessary identifying information, or is submitted to the wrong office, the time period for processing the request will begin when the correct official receives the properly labeled request and the necessary information.
