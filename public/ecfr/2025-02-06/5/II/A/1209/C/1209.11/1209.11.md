# ยง 1209.11   Duration of stay; interim compliance.

(a) *Duration of stay.* A stay becomes effective on the date specified in the judge's order. The stay will remain in effect for the time period set forth in the order or until the Board issues a final decision on the appeal of the underlying personnel action that was stayed, or until the Board vacates or modifies the stay, whichever occurs first.


(b) *Interim compliance.* An agency must immediately comply with an order granting a stay request. Although the order granting a stay request is not a final order, petitions for enforcement of such orders are governed by 5 CFR part 1201, subpart F.
