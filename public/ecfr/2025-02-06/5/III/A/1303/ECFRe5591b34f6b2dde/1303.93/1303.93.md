# § 1303.93   Miscellaneous fee provisions.

(a) *Charging interest—notice and rate.* OMB may begin assessing interest charges on an unpaid bill starting on the 31st day after OMB sends the bill. If OMB receives the fee within the thirty-day grace period, interest will not accrue on the paid portion of the bill, even if the payment is unprocessed. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date of the billing.


(b) *Charges for unsuccessful search.* OMB may properly charge for time spent searching even if it does not locate any responsive records or if OMB determines that the records are entirely exempt from disclosure.


(c) *Aggregating requests.*When OMB reasonably believes that a requester, or a group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, OMB may aggregate those requests and charge fees accordingly. OMB may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, OMB will aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters shall not be aggregated.


(d) *Advance payments.* (1) OMB will not require a requester to make an advance payment, *i.e.,* payment before work is commenced or continued on a request, unless OMB estimates or determines that allowable charges that a requester may be required to pay will exceed $250 or the requester has previously failed to make a payment due within 30 days of billing.


(2) In cases in which OMB requires advance payment, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within 30 calendar days after the date of OMB's fee determination, the request will be closed.


(e) *Effect of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365).* OMB will comply with applicable provisions of the Debt Collection Act, including disclosure to consumer reporting agencies and use of collection agencies, where appropriate, to encourage repayment.
