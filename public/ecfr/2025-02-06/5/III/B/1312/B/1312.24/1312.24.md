(a) The requirements of Section 4.2(a)(3) of Executive Order 12958 may be waived for persons who are engaged in historical research projects, or who previously have occupied policy-making positions to which they were appointed by the President. Waivers may be granted only if the Associate Director (or Assistant Director) for Administration, in cooperation with the EOP Security Officer: 


(1) Determines in writing that access is consistent with the interest of national security; 


(2) Takes appropriate steps to protect classified information from unauthorized disclosure or compromise, and ensures that the information is safeguarded in a manner consistent with the order; and 


(3) Limits the access granted to former Presidential appointees to items that the person originated, reviewed, signed, or received while serving as a Presidential appointee. 


(b) In the instances described in paragraph (a) of this section, the Associate Director (or Assistant Director) for Administration, in cooperation with the EOP Security Officer, will make a determination as to the trustworthiness of the requestor and will obtain written agreement from the requestor to safeguard the information to which access is given. He/She will also obtain written consent to the review by OMB of notes and manuscripts for the purpose of determining that no classified information is contained therein. Upon the completion of these steps, the material to be researched will be reviewed by the division/office of primary interest to ensure that access is granted only to material over which OMB has classification jurisdiction.
