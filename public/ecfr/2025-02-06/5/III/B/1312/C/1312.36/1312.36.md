# ยง 1312.36   Appeal procedure.

Appeals received as a result of a denial, see ยง 1312.34, will be routed to the Deputy Director who will take action as necessary to determine whether any part of the information may be declassified. If so, he will notify the requester of his determination and make that information available that is declassified and otherwise releasable. If continued classification is required, the requestor shall be notified by the Deputy Director of the reasons thereafter. Determinations on appeals will normally be made within 60 working days following receipt. If additional time is needed, the requestor will be notified and this reason given for the extension. The agency's decision can be appealed to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel.
