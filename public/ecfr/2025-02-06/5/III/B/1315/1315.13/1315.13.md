(1) On the amount of payment or loan due;


(2) For the period beginning on the first day beginning after the required payment or loan closing date and, except as determined appropriate by the CCC consistent with applicable law, ending on the date the amount is paid or loaned; and


(3) Out of funds available under Section 8 of the CCC Charter Act (15 U.S.C. 714f).
