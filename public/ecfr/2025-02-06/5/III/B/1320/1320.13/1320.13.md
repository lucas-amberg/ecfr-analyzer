# ยง 1320.13   Emergency processing.

An agency head or the Senior Official, or their designee, may request OMB to authorize emergency processing of submissions of collections of information.


(a) Any such request shall be accompanied by a written determination that:


(1) The collection of information:


(i) Is needed prior to the expiration of time periods established under this Part; and


(ii) Is essential to the mission of the agency; and


(2) The agency cannot reasonably comply with the normal clearance procedures under this part because:


(i) Public harm is reasonably likely to result if normal clearance procedures are followed;


(ii) An unanticipated event has occurred; or


(iii) The use of normal clearance procedures is reasonably likely to prevent or disrupt the collection of information or is reasonably likely to cause a statutory or court ordered deadline to be missed.


(b) The agency shall state the time period within which OMB should approve or disapprove the collection of information.


(c) The agency shall submit information indicating that it has taken all practicable steps to consult with interested agencies and members of the public in order to minimize the burden of the collection of information.


(d) The agency shall set forth in the _Federal Register_ notice prescribed by ยง 1320.5(a)(1)(iv), unless waived or modified under this section, a statement that it is requesting emergency processing, and the time period stated under paragraph (b) of this section.


(e) OMB shall approve or disapprove each such submission within the time period stated under paragraph (b) of this section, provided that such time period is consistent with the purposes of this Act.


(f) If OMB approves the collection of information, it shall assign a control number valid for a maximum of 90 days after receipt of the agency submission.
