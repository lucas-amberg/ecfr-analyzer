# § 1320.8   Agency collection of information responsibilities.

The office established under § 1320.7 shall review each collection of information before submission to OMB for review under this part.


(a) This review shall include:


(1) An evaluation of the need for the collection of information, which shall include, in the case of an existing collection of information, an evaluation of the continued need for such collection;


(2) A functional description of the information to be collected;


(3) A plan for the collection of information;


(4) A specific, objectively supported estimate of burden, which shall include, in the case of an existing collection of information, an evaluation of the burden that has been imposed by such collection;


(5) An evaluation of whether (and if so, to what extent) the burden on respondents can be reduced by use of automated, electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or other forms of information technology, e.g., permitting electronic submission of responses;


(6) A test of the collection of information through a pilot program, if appropriate; and


(7) A plan for the efficient and effective management and use of the information to be collected, including necessary resources.


(b) Such office shall ensure that each collection of information:


(1) Is inventoried, displays a currently valid OMB control number, and, if appropriate, an expiration date;


(2) Is reviewed by OMB in accordance with the clearance requirements of 44 U.S.C. § 3507; and


(3) Informs and provides reasonable notice to the potential persons to whom the collection of information is addressed of—


(i) The reasons the information is planned to be and/or has been collected;


(ii) The way such information is planned to be and/or has been used to further the proper performance of the functions of the agency;


(iii) An estimate, to the extent practicable, of the average burden of the collection (together with a request that the public direct to the agency any comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and any suggestions for reducing this burden);


(iv) Whether responses to the collection of information are voluntary, required to obtain or retain a benefit (citing authority), or mandatory (citing authority);


(v) The nature and extent of confidentiality to be provided, if any (citing authority); and


(vi) The fact that an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.


(c)(1) An agency shall provide the information described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (v) of this section as follows:


(i) In the case of forms, questionnaires, instructions, and other written collections of information sent or made available to potential respondents (except in an electronic format), such information can be included either on the form, questionnaire or other collection of information, as part of the instructions for such collection, or in a cover letter or memorandum that accompanies the collection of information.


(ii) In the case of forms, questionnaires, instructions, and other written collections of information sent or made available to potential respondents in an electronic format, such information can be included either in the instructions, near the title of the electronic collection instrument, or, for on-line applications, on the first screen viewed by the respondent;


(iii) In the case of collections of information published in regulations, guidelines, and other issuances in the _Federal Register,_ such information can be published in the _Federal Register_ (for example, in the case of a collection of information in a regulation, by publishing such information in the preamble or the regulatory text to the final rule, or in a technical amendment to the final rule, or in a separate notice announcing OMB approval of the collection of information).


(iv) In other cases, and where OMB determines in advance in writing that special circumstances exist, agencies may use other means to inform potential respondents.


(2) An agency shall provide the information described in paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section in a manner that is reasonably calculated to inform the public (see § 1320.5(b)(2)(ii)).


(d)(1) Before an agency submits a collection of information to OMB for approval, and except as provided in paragraphs (d)(3) and (d)(4) of this section, the agency shall provide 60-day notice in the _Federal Register,_ and otherwise consult with members of the public and affected agencies concerning each proposed collection of information, to solicit comment to:


(i) Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the information will have practical utility;


(ii) Evaluate the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used;


(iii) Enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and


(iv) Minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate automated, electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or other forms of information technology, e.g., permitting electronic submission of responses.


(2) If the agency does not publish a copy of the proposed collection of information, together with the related instructions, as part of the _Federal Register_ notice, the agency should—


(i) Provide more than 60-day notice to permit timely receipt, by interested members of the public, of a copy of the proposed collection of information and related instructions; or


(ii) Explain how and from whom an interested member of the public can request and obtain a copy without charge, including, if applicable, how the public can gain access to the collection of information and related instructions electronically on demand.


(3) The agency need not separately seek such public comment for any proposed collection of information contained in a proposed rule to be reviewed under § 1320.11, if the agency provides notice and comment through the notice of proposed rulemaking for the proposed rule and such notice specifically includes the solicitation of comments for the same purposes as are listed under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.


(4) The agency need not seek or may shorten the time allowed for such public comment if OMB grants an exemption from such requirement for emergency processing under § 1320.13.
