The Designated Agency Ethics Official, or the Bureau Ethics Counselor for a Bureau employee may waive any provision of this part upon finding that the waiver will not result in conduct inconsistent with 5 CFR part 2635 and is not otherwise prohibited by law and that application of the provision is not necessary to ensure public confidence in the Department's impartial and objective administration of its programs. Each waiver shall be in writing and supported by a statement of the facts and findings upon which it is based and may impose appropriate conditions, such as requiring the employee's execution of a written disqualification statement. A waiver will be considered only in response to a written waiver request submitted to an agency ethics official. The waiver request should include:


(a) The requesting employee's Branch, Unit, and a detailed description of his or her official duties;


(b) The nature and extent of the proposed waiver;


(c) A detailed statement of the facts supporting the request; and


(d) The basis for the request, such as undue hardship or other exigent circumstances.
