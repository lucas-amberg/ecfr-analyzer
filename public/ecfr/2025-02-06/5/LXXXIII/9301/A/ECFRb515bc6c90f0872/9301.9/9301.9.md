# ยง 9301.9   Fees for categories of requesters.

SIGAR shall assess fees for certain categories of requesters as follows:


(a) *Commercial use requesters.* In responding to commercial use requests, SIGAR shall assess fees that recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing and duplicating records.

(d) *All other requesters.* SIGAR shall charge requesters who do not fall within paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section fees that recover the full direct cost of searching for and duplicating records, excluding charges for the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two hours of search time.
