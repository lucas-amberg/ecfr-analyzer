# § 9401.104   Additional rules concerning outside employment for covered employees.

(a) *Prohibited outside employment with an entity supervised by the Bureau.* A covered employee shall not engage in compensated outside employment for an entity supervised by the Bureau or for an officer, director, or employee of such entity. For purposes of this section, “employment” has the same meaning as set forth in § 9401.103(b).


(b) *Use of professional licenses related to real estate.* A covered employee who holds a license related to real estate, mortgage brokerage, property appraisals, or real property insurance is prohibited from using such license for the production of income. The DAEO, in consultation with senior management in the Division in which the employee works, may grant a limited waiver to this prohibition based on a written finding that the specific transaction which requires use of the license will not create an appearance of loss of impartiality or use of public office for private gain.


(c) *Definition of covered employee.* For purposes of this section, “covered employee” means:


(1) An employee in the Division of Supervision, Enforcement, and Fair Lending;


(2) An employee serving in an attorney position;


(3) An employee in the Office of Research, serving as a section chief at Bureau pay band 71 or above or as a senior economist in the Compliance Analytics and Policy Section;


(4) An employee serving in the Office of Consumer Response in an investigations position;


(5) An employee required to file a Public Financial Disclosure Report (OGE Form 278e) under 5 CFR part 2634; or


(6) Any other Bureau employee specified in a Bureau order or directive whose duties and responsibilities, as determined by the DAEO, require application of the prohibition on outside employment contained in this section to ensure public confidence that the Bureau's programs are conducted impartially and objectively.
