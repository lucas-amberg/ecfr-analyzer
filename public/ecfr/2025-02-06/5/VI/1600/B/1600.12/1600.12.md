# ยง 1600.12   Contribution elections.

(a) An employee may make a contribution election at any time.


(b) A participant must submit a contribution election to his or her employing agency. To make an election, employees may use either the paper election form provided by the TSP, or, if available from their employing agency, electronic media. If an electronic medium is used, all relevant elements contained on the paper form must be included in the electronic medium.


(c) A contribution election must:


(1) Be completed in accordance with the instructions on the form, if a paper form is used;


(2) Be made in accordance with the employing agency's instructions, if the submission is made electronically; and


(3) Not exceed the maximum contribution limitations described in ยง 1600.22.


(d) A contribution election will become effective no later than the first full pay period after it is received by the employing agency.


(e) A uniformed service member may elect to contribute sums to the TSP from basic pay and special or incentive pay (including bonuses). However, in order to contribute to the TSP from special or incentive pay (including bonuses), the uniformed service member must also elect to contribute to the TSP from basic pay. A uniformed service member may elect to contribute from special pay or incentive pay (including bonuses) in anticipation of receiving such pay (that is, he or she does not have to be receiving the special or incentive pay (including bonuses) when the contribution election is made); those elections will take effect when the uniformed service member receives the special or incentive pay (including bonuses).
