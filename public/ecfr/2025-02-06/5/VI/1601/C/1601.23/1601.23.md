# ยง 1601.23   Methods of requesting a fund transfer.

(a) Participants may make a fund transfer from one or more TSP core fund to a different TSP core fund(s) in the form and manner prescribed by the TSP record keeper. Paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section apply to a fund transfer request:


(1) Fund transfer requests when selecting the TSP core funds to transfer out of, may be made in whole percentages or in dollars. When selecting the TSP core funds to transfer into, elections must be made in whole percentages (one percent increments). The sum of the percentages elected to transfer into for all of the TSP core funds must equal 100 percent.


(2) The percentages elected by the participant will be applied to the balances in each source of contributions and to both traditional and Roth balances and tax-deferred and tax-exempt balances on the effective date of the fund transfer.


(b) A fund transfer request has no effect on deposits made after the effective date of the fund transfer request; subsequent deposits will continue to be allocated among the TSP core funds in accordance with the participant's investment election made under subpart B of this part.


(c) If a fund transfer is found to be invalid pursuant to ยง 1601.34, the purported fund transfer will not be made.
