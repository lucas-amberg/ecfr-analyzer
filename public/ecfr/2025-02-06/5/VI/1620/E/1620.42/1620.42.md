# ยง 1620.42   Processing TSP contribution elections.

(a) *Current contribution election.* If the employee entered nonpay status with a valid contribution election on file, the agency must immediately reinstate that election for current contributions when the employee returns to pay status, unless the employee files a new contribution election. If the employee separated to perform military service, he or she must make a new contribution election to begin current contributions.


(b) *Makeup contribution election.* Upon reemployment or return to pay status, an employee has 60 days to elect to make up missed contributions. An employee's right to make retroactive TSP contributions will expire if an election is not made within 60 days of the participant's reemployment or return to pay status.


(c) *Makeup contributions.* Makeup contributions will be processed as follows:


(1) If the employee had a valid contribution election on file when he or she separated or entered nonpay status to perform military service, that election will be reinstated for purposes of determining the makeup contributions, unless the employee submits a new contribution election which he or she could otherwise have made but for the performance of military service.


(2) An employee who terminated contributions within two months of entering military service will also be eligible to make a retroactive contribution election to be effective on the date the contributions were terminated.
