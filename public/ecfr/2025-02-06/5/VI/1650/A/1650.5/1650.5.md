# ยง 1650.5   Returned funds.

If a TSP withdrawal is returned as undeliverable, the TSP record keeper will attempt to locate the participant. If the participant does not respond within 90 days, the returned funds will be forfeited to the TSP. The participant can claim the forfeited funds, although they will not be credited with TSP investment fund returns.
