# ยง 1650.23   Accounts of less than $200.

Upon receiving information from the employing agency that a participant has been separated for more than 60 days and that any outstanding loans have been closed, provided the participant has not made a distribution election before the distribution is processed, if the account balance is $5.00 or more but less than $200, the TSP record keeper will automatically distribute the entire amount of his or her account balance. The TSP record keeper will not pay this amount by EFT. The participant may not elect to leave this amount in the TSP, nor will the TSP record keeper roll over any automatically distributed amount to an eligible employer plan, traditional IRA, or Roth IRA. However, the participant may make an indirect rollover of this payment into an eligible employer plan, traditional IRA, or Roth IRA to the extent the roll over is permitted by the Internal Revenue Code.
