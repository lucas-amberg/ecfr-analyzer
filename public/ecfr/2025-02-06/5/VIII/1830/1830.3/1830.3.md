# § 1830.3   Requirements for making Privacy Act requests.

(a) *Submission of requests.* A request for OSC records under the Privacy Act must be made in writing. The request must be sent:


(1) *By email to: foiarequest@osc.gov;* or


(2) *By mail to:* U.S. Office of Special Counsel, Chief Privacy Officer, 1730 M Street NW, Suite 218, Washington, DC 20036-4505.


(3) Both the request letter and envelope or email should clearly be marked “Privacy Act Request.” A Privacy Act request is deemed received by OSC when it reaches the Chief Privacy Officer.


(b) *Description of records sought.* Requestors must describe the records sought in enough detail for OSC to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort, including, where known, data such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter of the requested record.


(c) *Proof of identity.* OSC requires proof of identity from requestors seeking their own files, preferably a government-issued document bearing the subject individual's photograph. OSC requires a signed consent from the subject individual to release records to an individual's representative.


(d) *Freedom of Information Act processing.* OSC also processes all Privacy Act requests for access to records under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, by following the rules contained in part 1820 of this chapter.
