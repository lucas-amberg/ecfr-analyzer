(a) *Initiating appeals.* Requesters not satisfied with the FOIA Officer's decision may request review of the decision by the MCRMC FOIA Appellate Authority. The appeal must be received within 60 days of the date of the FOIA Officer's decision. Appeals may be made through the MCRMC Web site at the FOIA tab or in writing, addressed to: FOIA Appellate Authority, Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission, Post Office Box 13170, Arlington, VA 22209. As there may be delays in mail delivery, it is advisable to send the request via facsimile to (703) 697-8330 or email to *foia@mcrmc.gov.* The requester may wish to explain why the Appellate Authority should grant the appeal, to the extent that an explanation could assist the Appellate Authority in making a decision on the appeal.


(b) *Appeal decisions.* MCRMC's Chief FOIA Officer will decide the appeal within 20 days (except Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) from the date it receives the appeal. If the appeal is denied, MCRMC will notify the requester in writing of the decision and the provisions for judicial review. If the appeal is granted, the Chief FOIA Officer will notify the requester in writing.


(c) *Mediation.* A response to an appeal will advise the requester of the 2007 FOIA amendments, which created the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS), which offers mediation services to resolve disputes between FOIA requesters and Federal agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. A requester may contact OGIS at: Office of Government Information Services, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740; email: *ogis@nara.gov;* telephone: (202) 741-5770; facsimile: (202) 741-5769; toll free telephone: (877) 684-6448.
