# ยง 9701.363   Special staffing payments.

DHS will issue implementing directives regarding additional payments for employees serving in positions for which DHS is experiencing or anticipates significant recruitment and/or retention problems. DHS may determine the amount of the payments and the conditions for eligibility, including any performance or service agreement requirements. Payments may be made at the same time as basic pay or in periodic lump-sum payments. Special staffing payments are not basic pay for any purpose and may be terminated or reduced at any time without triggering pay retention or adverse action procedures.
