# § 9701.514   Determination of appropriate units for labor organization representation.

(a) The Authority will determine the appropriateness of any unit. The Authority must determine in each case whether, in order to ensure employees the fullest freedom in exercising the rights guaranteed under this subpart, the appropriate unit should be established on a Department, plant, installation, functional, or other basis and will determine any unit to be an appropriate unit only if the determination will ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest among the employees in the unit and will promote effective dealings with, and efficiency of the operations of the Department, consistent with the Department's mission and organizational structure.


(b) A unit may not be determined to be appropriate under this section solely on the basis of the extent to which employees in the proposed unit have organized, nor may a unit be determined to be appropriate if it includes—


(1) Except as provided under 5 U.S.C. 7135(a)(2), which is not waived for the purpose of this subpart, any management official or supervisor;


(2) A confidential employee;


(3) An employee engaged in personnel work in other than a purely clerical capacity;


(4) An employee engaged in administering the provisions of this subpart;


(5) Both professional employees and other employees, unless a majority of the professional employees vote for inclusion in the unit;


(6) Any employee engaged in intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or security work which directly affects national security; or


(7) Any employee primarily engaged in investigation or audit functions relating to the work of individuals employed by the Department whose duties directly affect the internal security of the Department, but only if the functions are undertaken to ensure that the duties are discharged honestly and with integrity.


(c) Pursuant to 6 U.S.C. 412(b)(2), a unit to which continued recognition was provided upon transfer to DHS may not include an employee whose primary duty has materially changed to consist of intelligence, counterintelligence, or investigative work directly related to terrorism investigation.


(d) Any employee who is engaged in administering any provision of law or this subpart relating to labor-management relations may not be represented by a labor organization—


(1) Which represents other individuals to whom such provision applies; or


(2) Which is affiliated directly or indirectly with an organization which represents other individuals to whom such provision applies.


(e) Two or more units in the Department for which a labor organization is the exclusive representative may, upon petition by the Department or labor organization, be consolidated with or without an election into a single larger unit if the Authority considers the larger unit to be appropriate. The Authority will certify the labor organization as the exclusive representative of the new larger unit.
