# § 9701.613   Suspension and removal.

(a) Notwithstanding other provisions of law or regulation, the Secretary may suspend an employee without pay when she or he considers suspension in the interests of national security. To the extent that the Secretary determines that the interests of national security permit, the suspended employee must be notified of the reasons for the suspension. Within 30 days after the notification, the suspended employee is entitled to submit to the official designated by the Secretary statements or affidavits to show why he or she should be restored to duty.


(b) Subject to paragraph (c) of this section, the Secretary may remove an employee suspended under this section when, after investigation and review as the Secretary considers necessary, the Secretary determines that removal is necessary or advisable in the interests of national security. The determination of the Secretary is final.


(c) An employee suspended under this section who has a permanent or indefinite appointment, has completed his or her initial service period, probationary period, or trial period, and is a citizen of the United States is entitled, after suspension and before removal, to—


(1) A written statement of the charges against the employee within 30 days after suspension, which may be amended within 30 days thereafter, and which must be stated as specifically as security considerations permit;


(2) An opportunity within 30 days thereafter, plus an additional 30 days if the charges are amended, to answer the charges and submit affidavits;


(3) A hearing, at the request of the employee, by a Department authority duly constituted for this purpose;


(4) A review of his or her case by the Secretary or designee, before a decision adverse to the employee is made final; and


(5) A written decision from the Secretary.
