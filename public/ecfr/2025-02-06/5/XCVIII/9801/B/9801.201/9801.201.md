# § 9801.201   Requests for access.

(a) *How addressed.* A requester seeking access to records pertaining to the requester in a CIGIE system of records should submit a written request that includes the words “Privacy Act Request” on both the envelope and at the top of the request letter to the Executive Director, Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, 1717 H Street NW., Suite 825, Washington, DC 20006.


(b) *Description of records sought.* (1) A request should contain a specific reference to the CIGIE system of records from which access to the records is sought. Notices of CIGIE systems of records subject to the Privacy Act are published in the _Federal Register,_ and copies of the notices are available on CIGIE's Web site at *www.ignet.gov,* or upon request from CIGIE's Office of General Counsel.


(2) If the written inquiry does not refer to a specific system of records, it must describe the records that are sought in enough detail to enable CIGIE personnel to locate the system of records containing them with a reasonable amount of effort.


(3) The request should state whether the requester wants a copy of the record or wants to examine the record in person.


(c) *Verification of identity.* A requester seeking access to records pertaining to the requester must verify their identity in their request. The request must state the requester's full name, current address, and date and place of birth. The requester must sign the request and the signature must either be notarized or state, “Under penalty of perjury, I hereby declare that I am the person named above and I understand that any falsification of this statement is punishable under the provisions of Title 18, United States Code (U.S.C.), Section 1001 by a fine of not more than $10,000 or by imprisonment of not more than five years, or both; and that requesting or obtaining any record(s) under false pretenses is punishable under the provisions of Title 5, U.S.C., Section 552a(i)(3) as a misdemeanor and by a fine of not more than $5,000.” In order to help the identification and location of requested records, the requester may optionally include their social security number. No identification shall be required if the records are required by 5 U.S.C. 552 to be released.


(d) *Verification of guardianship.* When making a request as the parent or guardian of a minor or as the guardian of someone determined by a court to be incompetent for access to records about that individual, the requester must establish:


(1) The identity of the individual who is the subject of the record, by stating the name, current address, date and place of birth, and, at the requester's option, the social security number of the individual;


(2) The requester's identity, as required in paragraph (c) of this section;


(3) That the requester is the parent or guardian of that individual, which may be established by providing a copy of the individual's birth certificate showing the requester's parentage or by providing a court order establishing the requester's guardianship; and


(4) That the requester is acting on behalf of that individual in making the request.
