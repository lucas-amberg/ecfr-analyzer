# ยง 2412.1   Purpose and scope.

This part contains the regulations that the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), including the Authority component (Authority), the General Counsel of the FLRA (General Counsel), the Inspector General (IG), and the Federal Service Impasses Panel (Panel), follow under the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a. These regulations should be read together with the Privacy Act, which provides additional information about records maintained on individuals. The regulations apply to all records maintained by the Authority, the General Counsel, the IG, and the Panel that are contained in a system of records, as defined at ยง 2412.2(d), and that are retrieved by an individual's name or personal identifier. They describe the procedures by which individuals may request access to records about themselves, request amendment or correction of those records, and request an accounting of disclosures of those records. In addition, the regulations limit the access of other persons to those records. The Authority, the General Counsel, the IG, and the Panel also process all Privacy Act requests for access to records under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, giving requesters the benefit of both statutes. These regulations do not relate to those personnel records of Federal Government employees, which are under the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) jurisdiction, to the extent such records are subject to OPM regulations.
