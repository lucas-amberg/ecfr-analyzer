# § 2412.6   Records about other individuals, medical records, and limitations on disclosures.

(a) Requests for records about an individual made by person other than that individual shall also be directed to the FLRA's Solicitor or IG, as appropriate, at the Authority's offices in Washington, DC, or by email to *privacy@flra.gov.* You must describe the records that you want in enough detail to enable Authority, General Counsel, IG, or Panel personnel to locate the system of records containing them with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever possible, your request should describe the time periods in which you believe the records were compiled and the name or identifying number of each system of records in which you believe the records are kept. The Authority, the General Counsel, the IG, and the Panel have published descriptions of the systems of records they maintain in the _Federal Register_.


(b) Such records shall only be made available to persons other than that individual in the following circumstances:


(1) To any person with the prior written consent of the individual about whom the records are maintained;


(2) To officers and employees of the Authority, the General Counsel, the IG, and the Panel who have a need for the records in the performance of their official duties;


(3) For a routine use compatible with the purpose for which it was collected, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(7) and as described under 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(D);


(4) To any person to whom disclosure is required by the Freedom of Information Act, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552;


(5) To the Bureau of the Census for purposes of planning or carrying out a census or survey or related activity pursuant to title 13 of the United States Code;


(6) In a form not individually identifiable to a recipient who has provided the Solicitor or IG with advance adequate written assurance that the record will be used solely as a statistical research or reporting record;


(7) To the National Archives and Records Administration or other appropriate entity as a record which has sufficient historical or other value warranting its preservation, or for evaluation by the Archivist of the United States or the designee of such official to determine whether the record has such value;


(8) To another agency or to an instrumentality of any governmental jurisdiction within or under control of the United States for a civil or criminal law enforcement activity that is authorized by law if the head of the agency or instrumentality has made a written request for the record to the Solicitor or IG, in accordance with part 2417 of this chapter, specifying the particular portion desired and the law enforcement activity for which the record is sought;


(9) To a person pursuant to a showing of compelling circumstances affecting the health or safety of an individual, provided that notification of such a disclosure shall be immediately mailed to the last known address of the individual;


(10) To either House of Congress or to any committee thereof with appropriate jurisdiction;


(11) To the Comptroller General, or any of Comptroller General's authorized representatives, in the performance of the official duties of the General Accountability Office;


(12) Pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction; or


(13) To a consumer reporting agency in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3711(e).


(c) The request shall be in writing and should be clearly and prominently identified as a Privacy Act request and, if submitted by mail or otherwise submitted in an envelope or other cover, should bear the mark “Privacy Act Request” on the envelope or other cover. If a request does not comply with the provisions of this paragraph, it shall not be deemed received until the time it is actually received by the Solicitor or the IG.


(d) If medical records are requested for inspection which, in the opinion of the Solicitor or the IG, as appropriate, may be harmful to the requester if personally inspected by such person, such records will be furnished only to a licensed health care professional designated to receive such records by the requester. Prior to such disclosure, the requester must furnish a signed written authorization to make such disclosure and the licensed health care professional must furnish a written request for the licensed health care professional's receipt of such records to the Solicitor or the IG, as appropriate.


(1) If such authorization is not executed within the presence of an Authority, General Counsel, or Panel representative, the authorization must be accompanied by a notarized statement verifying the identification of the requester.


(2) [Reserved]
