# § 2412.7   Initial decision on access requests.

(a) Within ten (10) working days of the receipt of a request pursuant to § 2412.5, the FLRA's Solicitor or IG will make an initial decision regarding whether the requested records exist and whether they will be made available to the requester. The Solicitor or IG will promptly communicate that initial decision to you in writing or other appropriate form.


(b) When the initial decision is to provide access to the requested records, the writing or other appropriate communication notifying you of the decision will:


(1) Briefly describe the records to be made available;


(2) State whether any records maintained about you in the system of records in question are not being made available;


(3) State whether any further verification of your identity is necessary; and


(4) Notify you of any fee charged under § 2412.13.


(5) The Solicitor or IG will promptly disclose the requested records to you upon payment of any applicable fee under § 2412.13.


(c) When the initial decision is not to provide access to requested records and accountings, the Solicitor or IG will, by writing or other appropriate communication, explain the reason for that decision. The Solicitor or IG will only refuse to provide you access when:


(1) Your verification of identity is inadequate under § 2412.5(d);


(2) No such records are maintained or an exemption applies;


(3) Your information is contained in, and inseparable from, another individual's record;


(4) The requested records have been compiled in reasonable anticipation of civil or criminal action or other proceedings.
