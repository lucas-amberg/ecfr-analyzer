# ยง 2412.9   Requests for amendment or correction of records.

(a) Unless the record is not subject to amendment or correction as stated in paragraph (b) of this section, you may make a request for amendment or correction of an Authority, General Counsel, IG, or Panel record about yourself or about an individual for whom you are a parent or guardian by submitting a written request to the FLRA's Solicitor or IG, as appropriate, following the procedures in ยง 2412.5. Your request should identify each particular record in question, state the amendment or correction that you want, and state why you believe that the record is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. Please note that a requester bears the burden of proving by the preponderance of the evidence that information is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. You may submit any documentation that you think would be helpful. If you believe that the same record is in more than one system of records, your request should state that.


(b) The following records are not subject to amendment or correction:


(1) Transcripts of testimony given under oath or written statements made under oath;


(2) Transcripts of grand jury proceedings, judicial proceedings, or quasi-judicial proceedings, which are the official record of those proceedings;


(3) Records in systems of records that have been exempted from amendment and correction under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) or (k), by notice published in the _Federal Register_; and


(4) Records compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.
