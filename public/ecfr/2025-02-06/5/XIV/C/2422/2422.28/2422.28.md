# § 2422.28   When is a runoff election required?

(a) *When a runoff may be held.* A runoff election is required in an election involving at least three (3) choices, one of which is “no union” or “neither,” when no choice receives a majority of the valid ballots cast. However, a runoff may not be held until the Regional Director has ruled on objections to the election and determinative challenged ballots.


(b) *Eligibility.* Employees who were eligible to vote in the original election and who are also eligible on the date of the runoff election may vote in the runoff election.


(c) *Ballot.* The ballot in the runoff election will provide for a selection between the two choices receiving the highest and second highest number of votes in the election.
