# § 2422.29   How does the Region address an inconclusive election?

(a) *Inconclusive elections.* An inconclusive election is one where challenged ballots are not sufficient to affect the outcome of the election and one of the following occurs:


(1) The ballot provides for at least three (3) choices, one of which is “no union” or “neither,” and the votes are equally divided; or


(2) The ballot provides for at least three (3) choices, the choice receiving the highest number of votes does not receive a majority, and at least two other choices receive the next highest and same number of votes; or


(3) When a runoff ballot provides for a choice between two labor organizations and results in the votes being equally divided; or


(4) When the Regional Director determines that there have been significant procedural irregularities.


(b) *Eligibility to vote in a rerun election.* The Region uses the latest payroll period to determine eligibility to vote in a rerun election.


(c) *Ballot.* If the Regional Director determines that the election is inconclusive, the election will be rerun with all the choices that appeared on the original ballot.


(d) *Number of reruns.* There will be only one rerun of an inconclusive election. If the rerun results in another inconclusive election, the tally of ballots will show a majority of valid ballots has not been cast for any choice, and the Regional Director will issue a certification of results. If necessary, a runoff may be held when an original election is rerun.
