The letter must update the information required with respect to receipt of:

(2) Honoraria, as defined in § 2634.105(i).


(b) *Timing.* The nominee's letter must be submitted to the Senate committees considering the nomination by the agency at or before the commencement of the first committee hearing to consider the nomination. The agency must also transmit copies of the nominee's letter to the designated agency ethics official referred to in § 2634.605(c)(1) and to the Office of Government Ethics.
