# § 2635.807   Teaching, speaking, and writing.

(a) *Compensation for teaching, speaking, or writing.* Except for teaching certain courses as permitted by paragraph (a)(3) of this section, an employee, including a special Government employee, may not receive compensation from any source other than the Government for teaching, speaking, or writing that occurs while the person is a Government employee and that relates to the employee's official duties.


(1) *Relationship to other limitations on receipt of compensation.* The compensation prohibition contained in this section is in addition to any other limitation on receipt of compensation set forth in this chapter, including:


(i) The requirement contained in § 2636.307 of this chapter that covered noncareer employees obtain advance authorization before engaging in teaching for compensation; and


(ii) The prohibitions and limitations in § 2635.804 and in § 2636.304 of this chapter on receipt of outside earned income applicable to certain Presidential appointees and to other covered noncareer employees.


(2) *Definitions.* For purposes of this paragraph (a):


(i) Teaching, speaking, or writing *relates to the employee's official duties* if:


(A) The activity is undertaken as part of the employee's official duties;


(B) The circumstances indicate that the invitation to engage in the activity was extended to the employee primarily because of their official position rather than their expertise on the particular subject matter;


(C) The invitation to engage in the activity or the offer of compensation for the activity was extended to the employee, directly or indirectly, by a person who has interests that may be affected substantially by performance or nonperformance of the employee's official duties;


(D) The information conveyed through the activity draws substantially on ideas or official data that are nonpublic information as defined in § 2635.703(b); or


(E) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(E)(*4*) of this section, the subject of the activity deals in significant part with:


(*1*) Any matter to which the employee presently is assigned or to which the employee had been assigned during the previous one-year period;


(*2*) Any ongoing or announced policy, program, or operation of the agency; or


(*3*) In the case of a noncareer employee as defined in § 2636.303(a) of this chapter, the general subject matter area, industry, or economic sector primarily affected by the programs and operations of the employee's agency.


(*4*) The restrictions in paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(E)(*2*) and (*3*) of this section do not apply to a special Government employee. The restriction in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(E)(*1*) of this section applies only during the current appointment of a special Government employee; except that if the special Government employee has not served or is not expected to serve for more than 60 days during the first year or any subsequent one-year period of that appointment, the restriction applies only to particular matters involving specific parties in which the special Government employee has participated or is participating personally and substantially.


(ii) *Agency* has the meaning set forth in § 2635.102(a), except that any component of a department designated as a separate agency under § 2635.203(a) will be considered a separate agency.


(iii) *Compensation,* for purposes of this paragraph (a):


(A) Includes any form of consideration, remuneration, or income, including royalties, given for or in connection with the employee's teaching, speaking, or writing.


(B) *Compensation* does not include:


(*1*) Items offered by any source that could be accepted from a prohibited source under subpart B of this part;


(*2*) Meals or other incidents of attendance such as waiver of attendance fees or course materials furnished as part of the event at which the teaching or speaking takes place;


(*3*) Copies of books or of publications containing articles, reprints of articles, tapes of speeches, and similar items that provide a record of the teaching, speaking, or writing activity; or


(*4*) Travel expenses for certain individuals as described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(C) of this section.


(C) For employees other than covered noncareer employees as defined in § 2636.303(a) of this chapter, *compensation* does not include travel expenses, consisting of transportation, lodging or meals, incurred in connection with the teaching, speaking, or writing activity. For covered noncareer employees as defined in § 2636.303(a) of this chapter, *compensation* does include transportation, lodging, and meals, whether provided in kind, by purchase of a ticket, by payment in advance, or by reimbursement after the expense has been incurred, unless such travel expenses are accepted under specific statutory authority, such as 31 U.S.C. 1353, 5 U.S.C. 4111, or 5 U.S.C. 7342, or an agency gift acceptance statute.


(iv) *Receive* means that there is actual or constructive receipt of the compensation by the employee so that the employee has the right to exercise dominion and control over the compensation and to direct its subsequent use. Receipt of compensation is attributable to the time that the teaching, speaking, or writing occurs when there is actual or constructive receipt of the compensation by the employee. If the employee has an enforceable agreement to receive compensation for writing undertaken during Government service, then compensation is received while the individual is an employee even though actual payment may be deferred until after Government service. Compensation received by an employee includes compensation which is:


(A) Paid to another person, including a charitable organization, on the basis of designation, recommendation, or other specification by the employee; or


(B) Paid with the employee's knowledge and acquiescence to the employee's parent, sibling, spouse, child, or dependent relative.


(v) *Particular matter involving specific parties* has the meaning set forth in § 2640.102(l) of this chapter.


(vi) *Personal and substantial participation* has the meaning set forth in § 2635.402(b)(4).


(3) *Exception for teaching certain courses.* Notwithstanding that the activity would relate to their official duties under paragraph (a)(2)(i)(B) or (E) of this section, employees may accept compensation for teaching a course requiring multiple presentations by the employee if the course is offered as part of:


(i) The regularly established curriculum of:


(A) An institution of higher education as defined at 20 U.S.C. 1001 or from a similar foreign institution of higher education;


(B) An elementary school as defined at 20 U.S.C. 7801(19); or


(C) A secondary school as defined at 20 U.S.C. 7801(45); or


(ii) A program of education or training sponsored and funded by the Federal Government or by a State or local government which is not offered by an entity described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.




(b) *Reference to official position.* Employees who are engaged in teaching, speaking, or writing as outside employment or as an outside activity may not use or permit the use of their official title or position to identify themselves in connection with a teaching, speaking, or writing activity, or to promote any book, seminar, course, program, or similar undertaking, except that:


(1) Employees may include or permit the inclusion of their title or position as one of several biographical details when such information is given to identify them in connection with their teaching, speaking, or writing, provided that their title or position is given no more prominence than other significant biographical details;


(2) Employees may use or permit the use of their title or position in connection with an article published in a scientific or professional journal, provided that the title or position is accompanied by a reasonably prominent disclaimer satisfactory to the agency stating that the views expressed in the article do not necessarily represent the views of the agency or the United States; and


(3) Employees who are ordinarily addressed using a general term of address, such as “The Honorable” or “Judge,” or a rank, such as a military or ambassadorial rank, may use or permit the use of that term of address or rank in connection with their teaching, speaking, or writing.
