# ยง 4001.104   Prohibited borrowing.

(a) *Prohibition on employee borrowing.* Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no covered employee, or spouse or minor child of a covered employee, shall seek or obtain any loan or extension of credit from a System institution or from an officer, director, employee, or related entity of a System institution.


(b) *Exception.* This section does not prohibit a covered employee, or spouse or minor child of a covered employee, from retaining a loan from a System institution on its original terms if the loan was obtained prior to appointment to a covered employee position. For loans retained pursuant to this paragraph, a covered employee shall submit to his or her immediate supervisor, the ethics liaison in his or her office, and the DAEO, a written disqualification from examining, auditing, visiting, reviewing, investigating, or otherwise participating in the regulation or supervision of the System institution that is providing the retained credit. Written disqualification shall be made within 30 days of appointment to a covered employee position on a form prescribed by the DAEO. Any renewal or renegotiation of a pre-existing loan or extension of credit will be treated as a new loan subject to the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section.
