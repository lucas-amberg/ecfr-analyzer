(a) *Prohibition on purchasing assets owned by a System institution.* No covered employee, or spouse or minor child of a covered employee, shall purchase, directly or indirectly, an asset (such as real property, vehicles, furniture, or similar items) from a System institution or related entity, unless it is sold at a public auction or by other means which assure that the selling price is the asset's fair market value. A covered employee shall obtain concurrence from the DAEO about whether a proposed purchase of a System institution asset is proper.


(b) *Assets held or managed by the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation or a receiver or conservator*—(1) *Prohibition on purchase.* No covered employee, or spouse or minor child of a covered employee, shall purchase, directly or indirectly, an asset (such as real property, vehicles, furniture, or similar items) that is held or managed by a receiver or conservator for a System institution or that is held by the Farm Credit System Insurance Corporation (Corporation) as a result of its provision of open bank assistance to troubled System banks regardless of how the asset is sold.


(2) *Disqualification.* A covered employee who is involved in the disposition of receivership or conservatorship assets, or assets acquired by the Corporation as a result of its provision of open bank assistance to troubled System banks, shall disqualify himself or herself from participation in the disposition of such assets when the employee becomes aware that anyone with whom the employee has a covered relationship, as defined in § 2635.502(b)(1) of the Executive Branch-wide Standards, is or will be attempting to acquire such assets. The employee shall provide written notification of the disqualification to his or her immediate supervisor, the ethics liaison in his or her office, and the DAEO.
