# ยง 12.82   How will my property be returned if my petition or claim is successful?

If, at the conclusion of the appropriate proceedings, seized property is to be returned to the owner or consignee, the Solicitor or Service will issue a letter or other document authorizing its return. This letter or other document will be delivered personally or sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, and will identify the owner or consignee, the seized property, and, if appropriate, the custodian of the seized property. It will also provide that, upon presentation of the letter or other document and proper identification, and the signing of a receipt provided by the Solicitor or the Service, the seized property is authorized to be released, provided it is properly marked in accordance with applicable State or Federal requirements.
