To qualify for an exception in § 14.257, a licensed entity or a registered Federal facility must meet all of the requirements of this section.


(a) A licensed entity or a registered Federal facility must not allow any individual to come into direct physical contact with a prohibited wildlife species, unless that individual is a:

(2) Licensed veterinarian (or a veterinary student accompanying such a veterinarian); or


(3) Person who is directly supporting conservation programs of the licensed entity or registered Federal facility, the direct contact is not in the course of commercial activity (which may be evidenced by advertisement or promotion of such activity or other relevant evidence), and the direct contact is incidental to humane husbandry conducted pursuant to a species-specific, publicly available, peer-edited population management and care plan that has been provided to the Service with justifications that the plan—


(i) Reflects established conservation science principles;


(ii) Incorporates genetic and demographic analysis of a multi-institution population of animals covered by the plan; and

(c) A licensed entity or a registered Federal facility must maintain complete and accurate records of any possession, breeding, transportation, acquisition, receipt, purchase, sale, disposition, importation, or exportation of prohibited wildlife species.


(1) The records required by this paragraph (c) must be up to date and include the names and addresses of persons to or from whom any prohibited wildlife species has been acquired, received, imported, exported, purchased, sold, or otherwise transferred (including loans for exhibition, breeding, or otherwise), and the dates of these transactions.


(2) The licensed entity or registered Federal facility must maintain the records required by this paragraph (c) for the lifespan of each prohibited wildlife species and for 5 years after its death or disposition and must copy these records for Service officials, if requested.
