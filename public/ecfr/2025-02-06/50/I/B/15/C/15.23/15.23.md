(b) Issuance criteria. Upon receiving an application completed in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the Director will decide whether or not a permit should be issued. In making this decision, the Director shall consider, in addition to the general criteria in part 13 of this subchapter, the following factors:


(1) Whether the zoological breeding or display program is adequate to justify removing the exotic bird from the wild or otherwise changing its status;


(2) Whether the proposed import would be detrimental to the survival of the exotic bird species in the wild, including whether the exotic bird was bred in captivity or was (or will be) taken from the wild, taking into consideration the conservation status of the species in the wild;


(3) Whether the permit, if issued, would conflict with any known program intended to enhance the survival of the population from which the exotic bird was or would be removed;


(4) Whether the breeding or display program for which the permit is required has conservation merit; and


(5) Whether the expertise, facilities or other resources available to the applicant appear adequate for proper care and maintenance of the exotic bird and to successfully accomplish the zoological breeding or display objectives stated in the application.


(c) Permit conditions. In addition to the general conditions set forth in part 13 of this subchapter, every permit issued under this section shall be subject to special conditions as the Director may deem appropriate.


(d) Duration of permits. The duration of the import permits issued under this section shall be designated on the face of the permit, but in no case will these permits be valid for longer than one year.
