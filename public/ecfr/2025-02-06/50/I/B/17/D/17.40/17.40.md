(6) *Sport-hunted trophies.* (i) African elephant sport-hunted trophies may be imported into the United States provided:


(A) The trophy was legally taken in an African elephant range country that declared an ivory export quota to the CITES Secretariat for the year in which the trophy animal was killed;


(B) A determination is made that the killing of the trophy animal will enhance the survival of the species and the trophy is accompanied by a threatened species permit issued under § 17.32;


(C) The trophy is legibly marked in accordance with 50 CFR part 23;


(D) The requirements in 50 CFR parts 13, 14, and 23 and paragraph (e)(11) of this section have been met; and


(E) No more than two African elephant sport-hunted trophies are imported by any hunter in a calendar year.


(ii) For African elephant sport-hunted trophies taken on or after May 1, 2024, to make an enhancement determination under paragraph (e)(6)(i)(B) of this section and § 17.32, the Service must possess a properly documented and verifiable certification by the government of the range country dated no earlier than 1 year prior to the date the elephant is taken that:


(A) African elephant populations in the range country are biologically sustainable, as well as sufficiently large to sustain sport hunting at the level authorized by the country.


(B) Regulating authorities have the capacity to obtain sound data on these populations using scientifically based methods consistent with peer-reviewed literature.


(C) Regulating authorities recognize these populations as a valuable resource and have the legal and practical capacity to manage them for their conservation.


(D) Regulating governments follow the rule of law concerning African elephant conservation and management.


(E) The current viable habitat of these populations is secure and is not decreasing or degrading.


(F) Regulating authorities can ensure that the involved trophies have in fact been legally taken from the specified populations.


(G) Funds derived from the involved sport hunting are applied significantly toward African elephant conservation, including funds used for:


*(1)* Managing protected habitat, securing additional habitat, or restoring habitat to secure long-term populations of elephants in their natural ecosystems and habitats, including corridors between protected areas;


*(2)* Improving the quality and carrying capacity of existing habitats;


*(3)* Helping range country governments to produce or strengthen regional and national elephant conservation strategies and laws;


*(4)* Developing capacity within the range country to survey, census, and monitor elephant populations;


*(5)* Conducting elephant population surveys;


*(6)* Supporting enforcement efforts to combat poaching of African elephants; and


*(7)* Supporting local communities to help conserve the species in the wild through protecting, expanding, or restoring habitat or other methods used to prevent or mitigate human-elephant conflict.




(iii) It is unlawful to sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce or to deliver, receive, carry, transport, or ship in interstate or foreign commerce and in the course of a commercial activity any sport-hunted African elephant trophy. The exception in paragraph (e)(3) of this section regarding manufactured or handcrafted items containing *de minimis* quantities of ivory does not apply to ivory imported or exported under this paragraph (e)(6) as part of a sport-hunted trophy.


(iv) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(9) of this section, raw ivory that was imported as part of a sport-hunted trophy may not be exported from the United States. Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(5), (e)(7), (e)(8), and (e)(9) of this section, worked ivory imported as a sport-hunted trophy may not be exported from the United States. Parts of a sport-hunted trophy other than ivory may be exported from the United States without a threatened species permit issued under § 17.32, provided the requirements of 50 CFR parts 13, 14, and 23 have been met.


(7) *Import/export of ivory for law enforcement purposes.* Raw or worked ivory may be imported into and worked ivory may be exported from the United States by an employee or agent of a Federal, State, or tribal government agency for law enforcement purposes, without a threatened species permit issued under § 17.32, provided the requirements of 50 CFR parts 13, 14, and 23 have been met. It is unlawful to sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce and to deliver, receive, carry, transport, or ship in interstate or foreign commerce and in the course of a commercial activity any African elephant ivory that was imported into or exported from the United States for law enforcement purposes. The exception in paragraph (e)(3) of this section regarding manufactured or handcrafted items containing *de minimis* quantities of ivory does not apply to ivory imported or exported under this paragraph (e)(7) for law enforcement purposes.


(8) *Import/export of ivory for genuine scientific purposes.* (i) Raw or worked ivory may be imported into and worked ivory may be exported from the United States for genuine scientific purposes that will contribute to the conservation of the African elephant, provided:


(A) It is accompanied by a threatened species permit issued under § 17.32; and


(B) The requirements of 50 CFR parts 13, 14, and 23 have been met.


(ii) It is unlawful to sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce and to deliver, receive, carry, transport, or ship in interstate or foreign commerce and in the course of a commercial activity any African elephant ivory that was imported into or exported from the United States for genuine scientific purposes. The exception in paragraph (e)(3) of this section regarding manufactured or handcrafted items containing *de minimis* quantities of ivory does not apply to ivory imported or exported under this paragraph (e)(8) for genuine scientific purposes.


(9) *Antique ivory.* Antiques (as defined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section) are not subject to the provisions of this rule. Antiques containing or consisting of ivory may, therefore, be imported into or exported from the United States without a threatened species permit issued under § 17.32, provided the requirements of 50 CFR parts 13, 14, and 23 have been met. Nevertheless, nothing in this rule interprets or changes any provisions or prohibitions that may apply under the African Elephant Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 4201 *et seq.*), regardless of the age of the item. Antiques that consist of or contain raw or worked ivory may similarly be sold or offered for sale in interstate or foreign commerce and delivered, received, carried, transported, or shipped in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity without a threatened species permit issued under § 17.32.




(10) *Live African elephants.* (i) Live African elephants may be imported into the United States, provided the Service determines that the activity will enhance the survival of the species, the Service finds that the proposed recipient is suitably equipped to house and care for the live elephant (see criteria in § 23.65 of this chapter), the animal is accompanied by a threatened species permit issued under § 17.32, and the requirements in 50 CFR parts 13, 14, and 23 and paragraph (e)(11) of this section have been met.


(ii) To make an enhancement determination for the import of wild-sourced live African elephants under paragraph (e)(10)(i) of this section and § 17.32, the Service must possess a properly documented and verifiable certification by the government of the range country dated no earlier than 1 year prior to the date the elephant is removed from the wild that:


(A) African elephant populations in the range country are biologically sustainable, as well as sufficiently large to sustain removal of live elephants at the level authorized by the country.


(B) Regulating authorities have the capacity to obtain sound data on these populations using scientifically based methods consistent with peer-reviewed literature.


(C) Regulating authorities recognize these populations as a valuable resource and have the legal and practical capacity to manage them for their conservation.


(D) Regulating governments follow the rule of law concerning African elephant conservation and management.


(E) The current viable habitat of these populations is secure and is not decreasing or degrading.


(F) Regulating authorities can ensure that the involved live animals have in fact been legally taken from the specified populations and family units were kept intact to the maximum extent practicable.


(G) Regulating authorities can ensure that no live African elephants to be imported are pregnant.


(H) Funds derived from the import are applied significantly toward African elephant conservation, including funds used for:


*(1)* Managing protected habitat, securing additional habitat, or restoring habitat to secure long-term populations of African elephants in their natural ecosystems and habitats, including corridors between protected areas;


*(2)* Improving the quality and carrying capacity of existing habitats;


*(3)* Helping range country governments to produce or strengthen regional and national African elephant conservation strategies and laws;


*(4)* Developing capacity within the range country to survey, census, and monitor African elephant populations;


*(5)* Conducting African elephant population surveys;


*(6)* Supporting enforcement efforts to combat poaching of African elephants; and


*(7)* Supporting local communities to help conserve the species in the wild through protecting, expanding, or restoring habitat or other methods used to prevent or mitigate human-elephant conflict.


(I) The government of the range country first considers any live elephants that it approves for export for both in situ conservation programs and for transportation to other locations to augment extant wild populations or reintroduce elephants to extirpated ranges.


(iii) Live African elephants may be sold or offered for sale in interstate commerce, and delivered, received, carried, transported, or shipped in interstate commerce in the course of a commercial activity, provided the Service finds that the proposed recipient is suitably equipped to house and care for the live elephant (see criteria in § 23.65 of this chapter), and a special purpose permit is issued under § 17.32 or a captive-bred wildlife registration is issued under § 17.21(g).


(iv) Each permit issued to authorize activity with a live African elephant under 50 CFR parts 17 or 23 must include a condition that the elephant and its offspring will not be sold or otherwise transferred to another person or location without a special purpose permit issued under § 17.32. Each special purpose permit for a live African elephant must also include the same condition. Each special purpose permit issued for a live African elephant will require a finding by the Service that the proposed recipient is suitably equipped to house and care for the live elephant (see criteria in § 23.65 of this chapter).




(11) *CITES National Legislation Project and African elephants.* On or after January 1, 2026, live African elephants, sport-hunted trophies, and parts or products other than ivory and sport-hunted trophies may not be imported into the United States under the exceptions for importation provided in § 17.32 or paragraphs (e)(2), (e)(6), or (e)(10) of this section except when:


(i) All trade in the specimen has been and is accompanied by a valid CITES document issued by the Management Authority of a Party with a CITES Category One designation under the CITES National Legislation Project (see § 23.7 of this chapter and *http://www.cites.org*); or


(ii) When importation under paragraph (e)(2) of this section is for law enforcement purposes and meets the requirements as set forth at paragraph (e)(7) of this section for the import of ivory or is for genuine scientific purposes and meets the requirements as set forth at paragraph (e)(8) of this section for the import of ivory.




(f) Leopard (*Panthera pardus*) (1) Except as noted in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, all prohibitions of § 17.31 of this part and exemptions of § 17.32 of this part shall apply to the leopard populations occurring in southern Africa to the south of a line running along the borders of the following countries: Gabon/Rio Muni; Gabon/Cameroon; Congo/Cameroon; Congo/Central African Republic; Zaire/Central African Republic; Zaire/Sudan; Uganda/Sudan; Kenya/Sudan; Kenya/Ethiopia; Kenya/Somalia.


(2) A sport-hunted leopard trophy legally taken after the effective date of this rulemaking, from the area south of the line delineated above, may be imported into the United States without a Threatened Species permit pursuant to § 17.32 of this part, provided that the applicable provisions of 50 CFR part 23 have been met.




(g) Utah prairie dog (*Cynomys parvidens*).


(1) Except as noted in paragraphs (g)(2) through (g)(6) of this section, all prohibitions of § 17.31(a) and (b) and exemptions of § 17.32 apply to the Utah prairie dog.


(2) A Utah prairie dog may be directly or intentionally taken as described in paragraphs (g)(3) and (4) of this section on agricultural lands, properties within 0.8 kilometers (km) (0.5 miles (mi)) of conservation lands, and areas where prairie dogs create serious human safety hazards or disturb the sanctity of significant human cultural or human burial sites.


(3) *Agricultural lands and properties near conservation lands.* When permitted by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources (UDWR), or other parties as authorized in writing by the Service, direct or intentional take is allowed on private properties that are located within 0.8 km (0.5 mi) of conservation land, and on agricultural land. Records on permitted take will be maintained by the State (or other parties as authorized in writing by the Service), and made available to the Service upon request.


(i) *Agricultural land.* (A) Take may be permitted only on agricultural land being physically or economically affected by Utah prairie dogs, and only when the spring count on the agricultural lands is seven or more individuals, and only during the period of June 15 to December 31; and


(B) The land must:


(*1*) Meet the general classification of irrigated, dryland, grazing land, orchard, or meadow;


(*2*) Be capable of producing crops or forage;


(*3*) Be at least 2 contiguous hectares (5 contiguous acres) in area (smaller parcels may qualify where devoted to agricultural use in conjunction with other eligible acreage under identical legal ownership);


(*4*) Be managed in such a way that there is a reasonable expectation of profit;


(*5*) Have been devoted to agricultural use for at least 2 successive years immediately preceding the year in which application is made; and


(*6*) Meet State average annual (per-acre) production requirements.


(ii) *Private property near conservation land.* (A) Take may be permitted on private properties within 0.8 km (0.5 mi) of Utah prairie dog conservation land during the period of June 15 to December 31.


(B) Conservation lands are defined as non-Federal areas set aside for the preservation of Utah prairie dogs and are managed specifically or primarily toward that purpose. Conservation lands may include, but are not limited to, properties set aside as conservation banks, fee-title purchased properties, properties under conservation easements, and properties subject to a safe harbor agreement (see § 17.22). Conservation lands do not include Federal lands.


(iii) *Amount of permitted take on agricultural lands and private property near conservation land.* (A) The UDWR, or other parties as authorized in writing by the Service, will ensure that permitted take on agricultural lands and properties within 0.8 km (0.5 mi) of conservation lands does not exceed 10 percent of the estimated rangewide population annually.


(B) On agricultural lands, the UDWR, or other parties as authorized in writing by the Service, will limit permitted take to 7 percent of the estimated annual rangewide population and will limit within-colony take to one-half of a colony's estimated annual production. The UDWR, or other parties as authorized in writing by the Service, will spatially distribute the 7 percent allowed take on agricultural lands across the three Recovery Units, based on the distribution of the total annual population estimate within each Recovery Unit.


(C) In setting take limits on properties within 0.8 km (0.5 mi) of conservation lands, the UDWR, or other parties as authorized in writing by the Service, will consider the amount of take that occurs on agricultural lands. The State, or other parties as authorized in writing by the Service, will restrict the remaining permitted take (the amount that would bring the total take up to 10 percent of the estimated annual rangewide population) on properties within 0.8 km (0.5 mi) of conservation lands to animals in excess of the baseline population. The baseline population of these lands is determined in accordance with paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(D) of this section.


(D) Take on properties within 0.8 km (0.5 mi) of conservation lands is restricted to prairie dogs in excess of the baseline population. The baseline population is the highest estimated total (summer) population size on that property during the 5 years prior to the establishment of the conservation property, except that if no UDWR surveys to determine population size on a property were conducted during such 5-year period, the baseline population is the estimated total (summer) population size on that property as determined in the first survey conducted after the establishment of the conservation property. The baseline population will be established by the UDWR, or other parties as authorized in writing by the Service.


(E) Translocated Utah prairie dogs will count toward the take limits in paragraphs (g)(3)(iii)(A) through (D) of this section.


(iv) *Methods of allowed direct take on agricultural lands and private properties near conservation land.* Methods for controlling Utah prairie dogs on agricultural lands and properties within 0.8 km (0.5 mi) of conservation lands are limited to activities associated with translocation efforts by trained and permitted individuals complying with current Service-approved guidance, trapping intended for lethal removal, and shooting. Actions intended to drown or poison Utah prairie dogs and the use of gas cartridges, anticoagulants, and explosive devices are prohibited.


(4) *Human safety hazards and significant human cultural or human burial sites.* (i) Nonlethal take is allowed where Utah prairie dogs create serious human safety hazards or disturb the sanctity of significant human cultural or human burial sites, if approved in writing by the Service. To reduce hazards, prairie dog burrows may be filled with dirt if they are directly creating human hazards or disturbing the sanctity of significant human cultural or human burial sites. Utah prairie dogs also may be translocated from these sites to approved translocation sites by properly trained personnel using Service-approved translocation protocols.


(ii) Direct or intentional lethal take is allowed where Utah prairie dogs create serious human safety hazards or disturb the sanctity of significant human cultural or human burial sites, but only after all practicable measures to resolve the conflict are implemented, and only as approved in writing by the Service. A permit is not required to allow take under these conditions.


(A) All practicable measures means, with respect to these situations:


(*1*) Construction of prairie-dog-proof fence, above and below grade to specifications approved by the Service, around the area in which there is concern.


(*2*) Translocation of Utah prairie dogs out of the fenced area in which there is a concern must be conducted prior to allowing lethal take. Lethal take is allowed only to remove prairie dogs that remain in these areas after the measures to fence and translocate are successfully carried out.


(*3*) Continued maintenance or modification of the fence as needed to preclude Utah prairie dogs from entering the fenced sites.


(B) There are no restrictions on the amount, timing, or methods of lethal take allowed on lands where Utah prairie dogs create serious human safety hazards or disturb the sanctity of significant human cultural or human burial sites, as long as all qualifications in paragraphs (g)(4)(ii)(A)(1)through (3) of this section are met.


(C) The amount of take in areas where Utah prairie dogs create serious human safety hazards or disturb the sanctity of significant human cultural or human burial sites does not contribute to the upper permitted take limits described above for agricultural lands and private properties within 0.8 km (0.5 mi) of conservation lands.


(5) *Incidental take associated with agriculture.* Utah prairie dogs may be taken when take is incidental to otherwise-legal activities associated with legal and standard agricultural practices on legitimately operating agricultural lands. Acceptable practices include plowing to depths that do not exceed 46 cm (18 in.), discing, harrowing, irrigating crops, mowing, harvesting, and bailing, as long as the activities are not intended to eradicate Utah prairie dogs. There is no numeric limit established for incidental take associated with standard agricultural practices. Incidental take is in addition to, and does not contribute to, the take limits described in paragraphs (g)(2) through (4) of this section. A permit is not required for incidental take associated with agricultural practices.


(6) If the Service receives evidence that take pursuant to paragraphs (g)(2) through (5) of this section is having an effect that is inconsistent with the conservation of the Utah prairie dog, the Service may immediately prohibit or restrict such take as appropriate for the conservation of the species. The Service will notify the permitting entities in writing if take restrictions are necessary.




(h) Mountain lion (*Felis concolor*). (1) Except as allowed in paragraphs (h)(2), (h)(3), and (h)(4) of this section, no person shall take any free-living mountain lion (*Felis concolor*) in Florida.


(2) A mountain lion (*Felis concolor*) may be taken in this area under a valid threatened species permit issued pursuant to 50 CFR 17.52.


(3) A mountain lion (*Felis concolor*) may be taken in Florida by an employee or designated agent of the Service or the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission for taxonomic identification or other reasons consistent with the conservation of the endangered Florida panther (*Felis concolor coryi*). When it has been established by the Service, in consultation with the State, that an animal in question is not a Florida panther (*Felis concolor coryi*) or an eastern cougar (*Felis concolor couguar*), such animals may be removed from the wild. The disposition of animals so taken shall be at the discretion of the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission, with the concurrence of the Fish and Wildlife Service.


(4) Take for reasons of human safety is allowed as specified under 50 CFR 17.21(c)(2) and 17.21(c)(3)(iv).


(5) Any take pursuant to paragraph (h)(4) of this section must be reported in writing to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Office of Law Enforcement, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, LE-3000, Arlington, VA 22203, within 5 days. The specimen may only be retained, disposed of, or salvaged in accordance with directions from the Service.




(i) Columbian white-tailed deer (*Odocoileus virginianus leucurus*) (CWTD), the Columbia River distinct population segment. (1) *General requirements.* Other than as expressly provided at paragraph (i)(3) of this section, the provisions of § 17.31(a) apply to the CWTD.


(2) *Definitions.* For the purposes of this entry:


(i) *CWTD* means the Columbia River distinct population segment (DPS) of Columbian white-tailed deer or individual specimens of CWTD.


(ii) *Intentional harassment* means an intentional act which creates the likelihood of injury to wildlife by annoying it to such an extent as to significantly disrupt normal behavior patterns which include, but are not limited to, breeding, feeding, or sheltering. Intentional harassment may include prior purposeful actions to attract, track, wait for, or search out CWTD, or purposeful actions to deter CWTD.


(iii) *Problem CWTD* means an individual specimen of CWTD that has been identified in writing by a State conservation agency or the Service as meeting the following criteria:


(A) The CWTD is causing more than *de minimus* negative economic impact to a commercial crop;


(B) Previous efforts to alleviate the damage through nonlethal methods have been ineffective; and


(C) There is a reasonable certainty that additional property losses will occur in the near future if a lethal control action is not implemented.


(iv) *Commercial crop* means commercially raised horticultural, agricultural, or forest products.


(v) *State conservation agency* means the State agency in Oregon or Washington operating a conservation program for CWTD pursuant to the terms of a cooperative agreement with the Service in accordance with section 6(c) of the Endangered Species Act.


(3) *Allowable forms of take of CWTD.* Take of CWTD resulting from the following legally conducted activities is allowed:


(i) Intentional harassment not likely to cause mortality. A State conservation agency may issue permits to landowners or their agents to harass CWTD on lands they own, rent, or lease if the State conservation agency determines in writing that such action is not likely to cause mortality of CWTD. The techniques employed in this harassment must occur only as specifically directed or restricted by the State permit in order to avoid causing CWTD mortality.


(ii) Take of problem CWTD resulting in mortality. Take of problem CWTD is authorized under the following circumstances:


(A) Any employee or agent of the Service or the State conservation agency, who is designated by their agency for such purposes, may, when acting in the course of their official duties, take problem CWTD. This take must occur in compliance with all other applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations.


(B) The State conservation agency may issue a permit to landowners or their agents to take problem CWTD on lands they own, rent, or lease. Such take must be implemented only as directed and allowed in the permit obtained from the State conservation agency.


(iii) Accidental take of CWTD when carrying out State-permitted black-tailed deer damage control. Take of CWTD in the course of carrying out black-tailed deer damage control will be a violation of this rule unless the taking was accidental; reasonable care was practiced to avoid such taking; and the person causing the take was in possession of a valid black-tailed deer damage control permit from a State conservation agency. When issuing black-tailed deer damage control permits, the State conservation agency will provide education regarding identification of target species. The exercise of reasonable care includes, but is not limited to, the review of the educational material provided by the State conservation agency and identification of the target before shooting.


(iv) Accidental take of CWTD when carrying out State-permitted black-tailed deer hunting. Take of CWTD in the course of hunting black-tailed deer will be a violation of this rule unless the take was accidental; the take was in the course of hunting black-tailed deer under a lawful State permit; and reasonable due care was exercised to avoid such taking. The State conservation agency will provide educational material to hunters regarding identification of target species when issuing hunting permits. The exercise of reasonable care includes, but is not limited to, the review of the educational materials provided by the State conservation agency and identification of the target before shooting.


(4) *Take limits.* The amount of take of CWTD allowed for the activities in paragraphs (i)(3)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section will not exceed 5 percent of the CWTD population during any calendar year, as determined by the Service. By December 31 of each year, the Service will use the most current annual DPS population estimate to set the maximum allowable take for these activities for the following calendar year. If take exceeds 2 percent of the DPS population in a given calendar year, the Service will convene a meeting with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife to discuss CWTD management and strategies to minimize further take from these activities for the rest of the year. If take exceeds 5 percent of the CWTD population in any given calendar year, no further take under paragraphs (i)(3)(ii), (iii), and (iv) will be allowed during that year and any further take that does occur may be subject to prosecution under the Endangered Species Act.


(5) *Reporting and disposal requirements.* Any injury or mortality of CWTD associated with the actions authorized under paragraphs (i)(3), (6), and (7) of this section must be reported to the Service within 72 hours, and specimens may be disposed of only in accordance with directions from the Service. Reports should be made to the Service's Law Enforcement Office at (503) 231-6125, or the Service's Oregon Fish and Wildlife Office at (503) 231-6179. The Service may allow additional reasonable time for reporting if access to these offices is limited due to closure.


(6) *Additional taking authorizations for Tribal employees, State and local law enforcement officers, and State-licensed wildlife rehabilitation facilities.* (i) Tribal employees and State and local government law enforcement officers. When acting in the course of their official duties, both Tribal employees designated by the Tribe for such purposes, and State and local government law enforcement officers working in the States of Oregon or Washington, may take CWTD for the following purposes:


(A) Aiding or euthanizing sick, injured, or orphaned CWTD;


(B) Disposing of a dead specimen; and


(C) Salvaging a dead specimen that may be used for scientific study.


(ii) Such take must be reported to the Service within 72 hours, and specimens may be disposed of only in accordance with directions from the Service.


(7) *Wildlife rehabilitation facilities licensed by the States of Oregon or Washington.* When acting in the course of their official duties, a State-licensed wildlife rehabilitation facility may take CWTD for the purpose of aiding or euthanizing sick, injured, or orphaned CWTD. Such take must be reported to the Service within 72 hours as required by paragraph (i)(5) of this section, and specimens may be retained and disposed of only in accordance with directions from the Service.


(8) *Take authorized by permits.* Any person with a valid permit issued by the Service under § 17.32 may take CWTD, pursuant to the special terms and conditions of the permit.




(j) Argali (*Ovis ammon*) in Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, and Tajikistan. (1) Except as noted in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, all prohibitions of § 17.31 of this part and exemptions of § 17.32 of this part shall apply to this species in Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, and Tajikistan


(2) Upon receiving from the governments of Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, and Tajikistan properly documented and verifiable certification that (i) argali populations in those countries are sufficiently large to sustain sport hunting, (ii) regulating authorities have the capacity to obtain sound data on these populations, (iii) regulating authorities recognize these populations as a valuable resource and have the legal and practical capacity to manage them as such, (iv) the habitat of these populations is secure, (v) regulating authorities can ensure that the involved trophies have in fact been legally taken from the specified populations, and (vi) funds derived from the involved sport hunting are applied primarily to argali conservation, the Director may, consistent with the purposes of the Act, authorize by publication of a notice in the _Federal Register_ the importation of personal sport-hunted argali trophies, taken legally in Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, and Tajikistan after the date of such notice, without a Threatened Species permit pursuant to § 17.32 of this part, provided that the applicable provisions of 50 CFR part 23 have been met.


(k) Canada lynx (*Lynx canadensis*). (1) *What lynx does this special rule apply to?* The regulations in this paragraph (k) apply to all wild and captive lynx in the contiguous United States. 


(2) *What activities are prohibited for wild lynx?* All prohibitions and provisions of 50 CFR 17.31 and 17.32 apply to wild lynx found in the contiguous United States. 


(3) *What is considered a captive lynx?* (i) For purposes of this paragraph (k), captive lynx means lynx, whether alive or dead, and any part or product, if the specimen was in captivity at the time of the listing, born in captivity, or lawfully imported or transported into the contiguous United States. 


(ii) Lynx that were either born or held in captivity and then released into the wild are considered wild. 


(4) *What activities are allowed for captive lynx?* (i) *Take.* You may take lawfully obtained captive lynx without a permit. 


(ii) *Import and export.* You may export captive live lynx, parts or products of captive lynx provided the specimens are tagged with Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) export tags and/or accompanied by a valid CITES export permit. You may import lawfully obtained lynx that originated outside the United States when you follow the requirements of CITES. 


(iii) *Interstate commerce.* You may deliver, receive, carry, transport, ship, sell, offer to sell, purchase, or offer to purchase in interstate commerce captive lynx and captive lynx parts and products in accordance with State or tribal laws and regulations. In addition, lynx pelts that are properly tagged with valid CITES export tags also qualify for this exemption on interstate commerce. 


(5) *Are any activities not allowed or restricted for captive lynx?* You must comply with all applicable State and tribal laws and regulations. Violation of State or tribal law will also be a violation of the Act. 




(l) Preble's meadow jumping mouse (*Zapus hudsonius preblei*). (1) *What is the definition of take?* To harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, trap, kill, or collect; or attempt to engage in any such conduct. Incidental take is that which occurs when it is incidental to and not the purpose of an otherwise lawful activity. Any take that is not authorized by permit provided through section 7 or section 10 of the Act or that is not covered by the exemptions described below is considered illegal take.


(2) *When is take of Preble's meadow jumping mice allowed?* Take of Preble's meadow jumping mice resulting from the following legally conducted activities, in certain circumstances as described below, is allowed:


(i) *Take under permits.* Any person with a valid permit issued by the Service under § 17.32 may take Preble's meadow jumping mice pursuant to the terms of the permit.


(ii) *Rodent control.* Preble's meadow jumping mice may be taken incidental to rodent control undertaken within 10 feet of or inside any structure. “Rodent control” includes control of mice and rats by trapping, capturing, or otherwise physically capturing or killing, or poisoning by any substance registered with the Environmental Protection Agency as required by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136) and applied consistent with its labeling. “Structure” includes but is not limited to any building, stable, grain silo, corral, barn, shed, water or sewage treatment equipment or facility, enclosed parking structure, shelter, gazebo, bandshell, or restroom complex.


(iii) *Established, ongoing agricultural activities.* Preble's meadow jumping mice may be taken incidental to agricultural activities, including grazing, plowing, seeding, cultivating, minor drainage, burning, mowing, and harvesting, as long as these activities are established, ongoing activities and do not increase impacts to or further encroach upon the Preble's meadow jumping mouse or its habitat. New agricultural activities or those that expand the footprint or intensity of the activity are not considered to be established, ongoing activities.


(iv) *Maintenance and replacement of existing landscaping.* Preble's meadow jumping mice may be taken incidental to the maintenance and replacement of any landscaping and related structures and improvements, as long as they are currently in place and no increase in impervious surfaces would result from their maintenance and improvement. Construction of new structures or improvements or expansion of the landscaping in a manner that increases impervious surfaces would not be considered maintenance and replacement of existing landscaping.


(v) *Existing uses of water.* Preble's meadow jumping mice may be taken incidentally as a result of existing uses of water associated with the exercise of perfected water rights pursuant to State law and interstate compacts and decrees. (A “perfected water right” is a right that has been put to beneficial use and has been permitted, decreed, or adjudicated pursuant to State law.) Increasing the use or altering the location of use of an existing water right would not be considered an existing use of water.


(vi) *Noxious weed control.* Preble's meadow jumping mice may be taken incidental to noxious weed control that is conducted in accordance with:


(A) Federal law, including Environmental Protection Agency label restrictions;


(B) Applicable State laws for noxious weed control;

(D) Herbicide application guidelines as prescribed by herbicide manufacturers; and


(E) Any future revisions to the authorities listed in paragraphs (l)(2)(vi)(A) through (D) of this section that apply to the herbicides proposed for use within the species' range.


(vii) *Ditch maintenance activities.* Preble's meadow jumping mice may be taken incidental to normal and customary ditch maintenance activities only if the activities:


(A) Result in the annual loss of no more than 
1/4 mile of riparian shrub habitat per linear mile of ditch, including burning of ditches that results in the annual loss of no more than 
1/4 mile of riparian shrub habitat per linear mile of ditch.


(B) Are performed within the historic footprint of the surface disturbance associated with ditches and related infrastructure, and


(C) Follow the Best Management Practices described in paragraphs (l)(2)(vii)(C)(*1*) through (*3*) of this section.


(*1*) Persons engaged in ditch maintenance activities shall avoid, to the maximum extent practicable, impacts to shrub vegetation. For example, if accessing the ditch for maintenance or repair activities from an area containing no shrubs is possible, then damage to adjacent shrub vegetation shall be avoided.


(*2*) Persons engaged in placement or sidecasting of silt and debris removed during ditch cleaning, vegetation or mulch from mowing or cutting, and other material from ditch maintenance shall, to the maximum extent practicable, avoid shrub habitat and at no time disturb more than 
1/4 mile of riparian shrub habitat per linear mile of ditch within any calendar year.


(*3*) To the maximum extent practicable, all ditch maintenance activities should be carried out during the Preble's hibernation season, November through April.


(D) All ditch maintenance activities carried out during the Preble's active season, May through October, should be conducted during daylight hours only.


(E) Ditch maintenance activities that would result in permanent or long-term loss of potential habitat that would not be considered normal or customary include replacement of existing infrastructure with components of substantially different materials and design, such as replacement of open ditches with pipeline or concrete-lined ditches, replacement of an existing gravel access road with a permanently paved road, or replacement of an earthen diversion structure with a rip-rap and concrete structure, and construction of new infrastructure or the movement of existing infrastructure to new locations, such as realignment of a ditch, building a new access road, or installation of new diversion works where none previously existed.


(3) *When is take of Preble's not allowed?* (i) Any manner of take not described under paragraph (l)(2) of this section.


(ii) No person may import or export, ship in interstate commerce in the course of commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any Preble's meadow jumping mice.


(iii) No person, except for an authorized person, may possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any Preble's meadow jumping mice that have been taken illegally.


(4) *Where does this rule apply?* The take exemptions provided by this rule are applicable within the entire range of the Preble's meadow jumping mouse.

(E) A description of any changes in the number or size of natural reserves or national parks that provide protected habitat for the vicuña; 


(F) A summary of law enforcement activities undertaken in the last year, and a description of any changes in programs to prevent poaching, smuggling, and illegal commercialization of the vicuña; 


(G) A description of the current management and harvest (or “sustainable use”) programs for wild populations of the vicuña, including: any changes in the location and population size of wild populations being managed for sustainable use; any changes in the harvest management practices being used for each population; any changes in current harvest quotas for wild populations, if any; any changes in protocols for translocations undertaken as part of the use program; a summary of the specific financial costs of and revenues generated by the sustainable use program over the last year; and a summary of documented conservation benefits resulting from the sustainable use program over the last year; 


(H) A description of current management and harvest (or “sustainable use”) programs for captive and so-called “semi-captive” populations of the vicuña, including: any changes in the number and location of all captive and “semi-captive” populations; any changes in the size (ha) of each captive enclosure and the number of vicuña maintained therein; any changes in protocols for translocations undertaken as part of the use program; a summary of the financial costs of and revenues generated by the sustainable use program over the last year; and documented conservation benefits resulting from the sustainable use program over the last year (information on captive and “semi-captive” populations must be separate from that provided for wild populations); and 


(I) Export data for the last year. 


(ii) The Service's Division of Scientific Authority will conduct a review every 2 years, using information in the annual reports, to determine whether range country management programs are effectively achieving conservation benefits for the vicuña. Failure to submit an annual report could result in a restriction on trade in specimens of vicuña as addressed in paragraph (m)(3) of this section. Based on information contained in the annual reports and any other pertinent information it has available, the Service may restrict trade from a range country, as addressed in paragraph (m)(3) of this section, if it determines that the conservation or management status of threatened vicuña populations in a range country has changed, such that continued recovery of the vicuña population in that country may be compromised. Trade restrictions may result from one or more of the following factors: 


(A) A change in range country laws or regulations that lessens protection for vicuña; 


(B) A change in range country management programs that lessens protection for vicuña; 


(C) A documented decline in wild vicuña population numbers; 


(D) A documented increase in poaching of vicuña; 


(E) A documented decline in vicuña habitat quality or quantity; or 


(F) Other natural or man-made factors affecting the species' recovery.
