# § 17.95   Critical habitat—fish and wildlife.

(a) *Mammals.*

*Michigan.* Isle Royale National Park.


*Minnesota.* Areas of land, water, and airspace in Beltrami, Cook, Itasca, Koochiching, Lake, Lake of the Woods, Roseau, and St. Louis Counties, with boundaries (4th and 5th Principal meridians) identical to those of zones 1, 2, and 3, as delineated in 50 CFR 17.40(d)(l).




(b) *Birds.*

(c) *Reptiles.*

(d) *Amphibians.*

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Craven, Durham, Edgecombe, Franklin, Granville, Greene, Halifax, Johnston, Jones, Lenoir, Nash, Orange, Person, Pitt, Wake, Warren, Wayne, and Wilson Counties, North Carolina, on the maps in this entry.


(2) Within these areas, the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of Neuse River waterdog consist of the following components:


(i) Suitable substrates and connected instream habitats, characterized by geomorphically stable stream channels and banks (*i.e.,* channels that maintain lateral dimensions, longitudinal profiles, and sinuosity patterns over time without an aggrading or degrading bed elevation) with habitats that support a diversity of native aquatic fauna (such as stable riffle-run-pool habitats that provide flow refuges consisting of silt-free gravel, small cobble, coarse sand, and leaf litter substrates) as well as abundant cover and burrows used for nesting.


(ii) Adequate flows, or a hydrologic flow regime (which includes the severity, frequency, duration, and seasonality of discharge over time), necessary to maintain instream habitats where the species is found and to maintain connectivity of streams with the floodplain, allowing the exchange of nutrients and sediment for maintenance of the waterdog's habitat, food availability, and ample oxygenated flow for spawning and nesting habitat.


(iii) Water quality (including, but not limited to, conductivity, hardness, turbidity, temperature, pH, ammonia, heavy metals, and chemical constituents) necessary to sustain natural physiological processes for normal behavior, growth, and viability of all life stages.


(iv) Invertebrate and fish prey items, which are typically hellgrammites, crayfish, mayflies, earthworms, snails, beetles, centipedes, slugs, and small fish.


(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on July 9, 2021.


(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created by overlaying Natural Heritage Element Occurrence data and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) hydrologic data for stream reaches. The hydrologic data used in the critical habitat maps were extracted from the USGS 1:1M scale nationwide hydrologic layer (*https://nationalmap.gov/small_scale/mld/1nethyd.html*) with a projection of EPSG:4269-NAD83 Geographic. The North Carolina Natural Heritage program's species presence data were used to select specific stream segments for inclusion in the critical habitat layer. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public at *http://www.regulations.gov* under Docket No. FWS-R4-ES-2018-0092 and at the field office responsible for this designation. You may obtain field office location information by contacting one of the Service regional offices, the addresses of which are listed at 50 CFR 2.2.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created and digitized using ESRI's ArcMap (version 10.0) and comparing USGS NAIP/FSA high-resolution orthophotography from 2010 or later and previously mapped skipper habitat polygons submitted by contracted researchers or prairie habitat polygons made available from Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' County Biological Survey. Critical habitat units then were mapped in Geographic Coordinate System WGS84. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public at the Service's internet site (*http://www.fws.gov/midwest/Endangered/*), at *http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R3-ES-2013-0017, and at the field office responsible for this designation. You may obtain field office location information by contacting one of the Service regional offices, the addresses of which are listed at 50 CFR 2.2.
