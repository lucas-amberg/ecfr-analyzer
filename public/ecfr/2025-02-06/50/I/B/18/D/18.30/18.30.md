(b) *Definitions.* In addition to the definitions in this paragraph, the definitions in 50 CFR 10.12, 18.3, and 23.3 apply to this section.


(1) *Sport-hunted trophy* means a mount, rug or other display item composed of the hide, hair, skull, teeth, baculum, bones, and claws of the specimen which was taken by the applicant or decedent during a sport hunt for personal, noncommercial use and does not include any internal organ of the animal, including the gall bladder. Articles made from the specimen, such as finished or unfinished, worked, manufactured, or handicraft items for use as clothing, curio, ornamentation, jewelry, or as a utilitarian item are not considered trophy items.


(2) *Management agreement* means a written agreement between parties that share management responsibilities for a polar bear population which describes what portion of the harvestable quota will be allocated to each party and other measures which may be taken for the conservation of the population, such as harvest seasons, sex ratio of the harvest, and protection of females and cubs.


(c) *Procedures for issuance of permits and modification, suspension or revocation of permits.* We, the Service, shall suspend, modify or revoke permits issued under this section:


(1) In accordance with regulations contained in § 18.33; and


(2) If, in consultation with the appropriate authority in Canada, we determine that the sustainability of Canada's polar bear populations is being adversely affected or that sport hunting may be having a detrimental effect on maintaining polar bear populations throughout their range.


(d) *Issuance criteria.* In deciding whether to issue an import permit for a sport-hunted trophy, we must determine in addition to the general criteria in part 13 of this subchapter whether:


(1) You previously imported the specimen into the United States without a permit;


(2) The specimen meets the definition of a sport-hunted trophy in paragraph (b) of this section;


(3) You legally harvested the polar bear in Canada;


(4) Canada has a monitored and enforced sport-hunting program consistent with the purposes of the 1973 International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears;


(5) Canada has a sport-hunting program, based on scientifically sound quotas, ensuring the maintenance of the affected population at a sustainable level; and


(6) The export and subsequent import:


(i) Are consistent with the provisions of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and other international agreements and conventions; and


(ii) Are not likely to contribute to illegal trade in bear parts, including for bears taken after April 30, 1994, that the gall bladder and its contents were destroyed.


(e) *Additional permit conditions.* Your permit to import a sport-hunted trophy of a polar bear taken in Canada is subject to the permit conditions outlined in § 18.31(d) and the following additional permit conditions:


(1) You, the permittee, may not import internal organs of the polar bear, including the gall bladder;


(2) After import you may not alter or use the trophy in a manner inconsistent with the definition of a sport-hunted polar bear trophy as given in § 18.30(b);


(3) You may not import a sport-hunted trophy if the polar bear at the time you or the decedent took it was:


(i) A nursing bear or a female with nursing young (*i.e.*, part of a family group);


(ii) A pregnant female; or


(iii) A bear moving into a den or in a den;


(4) You must present to Service personnel at the time of import a valid CITES document from the country of export or re-export;


(5) You must comply with the following import procedures:


(i) Import the sport-hunted trophy through a designated port for wildlife imports (see § 14.12 of this subchapter) during regular business hours, except for full mount trophies that have been granted an exception to designated port permit requirements under § 14.32 of this subchapter;


(ii) Not send the trophy through the international mail; and


(iii) Notify Service personnel at the port at least 48 hours before the import (see § 14.54 of this subchapter) and make arrangements for Service personnel to affix a tag in accordance with paragraph (e)(7) of this section prior to being cleared (see § 14.52 of this subchapter);


(6) You must import all parts of a single trophy at the same time;


(7) The following tagging/marking procedures apply:


(i) Service personnel must affix a permanently locking tag that contains a unique serial number and the common name “polar bear” to the hide which must remain fixed indefinitely to the hide as proof of legal import; and


(ii) Service personnel must permanently mark upon import the parts of the trophy other than the hide, such as the skull and bones, with the hide tag number; and


(8) If the tag comes off the hide, you must within 30 days:


(i) Contact the nearest Service office at a designated port or a Law Enforcement office as given in § 10.22 of this subchapter to schedule a time to present the trophy for retagging;


(ii) Provide as proof that the trophy had been tagged and legally imported a copy of the:


(A) Canceled CITES export permit or re-export certificate;


(B) Canceled U.S. import permit issued under this section; or

(h) *Scientific review.* (1) We will undertake a scientific review of the impact of permits issued under this section on the polar bear populations in Canada within 2 years of March 20, 1997.


(i) The review will provide an opportunity for public comment and include a response to the public comment in the final report; and


(ii) We will not issue permits under this section if we determine, based upon scientific review, that the issuance of permits under this section is having a significant adverse impact on the polar bear populations in Canada; and


(2) After the initial review, we may review whether the issuance of permits under this section is having a significant adverse impact on the polar bear populations in Canada annually in light of the best scientific information available. The review must be completed no later than January 31 in any year a review is undertaken.


(i) *Findings.* Polar bear sport-hunted trophies may only be imported after issuance of an import permit, and in accordance with the following findings and conditions:
