# ยง 20.26   Emergency closures.

(a) The Director may close or temporarily suspend any season established under subpart K of this part:


(1) Upon a finding that a continuation of such a season would constitute an imminent threat to the safety of any endangered or threatened species or other migratory bird populations.


(2) Upon issuance of local public notice by such means as publication in local newspapers of general circulation, posting of the areas affected, notifying the State wildlife conservation agency, and announcement on local radio and television.


(b) Any such closure or temporary suspension shall be announced by publication of a notice to that effect in the _Federal Register_ simultaneous with the local public notice referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. However, in the event that it is impractical to publish a _Federal Register_ notice simultaneously, due to the restriction in time available and the nature of the particular emergency situation, such notice shall follow the steps outlined in paragraph (a) of this section as soon as possible.


(c) Any closure or temporary suspension under this section shall be effective on the date of publication of the _Federal Register_ notice; or if such notice is not published simultaneously, then on the date and at the time specified in the local notification to the public. Every notice of closure shall include the date and time of closing of the season and the area or areas affected. In the case of a temporary suspension, the date and time when the season may be resumed shall be provided by a subsequent local notification to the public, and by publication in the _Federal Register._
