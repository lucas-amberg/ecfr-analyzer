# ยง 20.105   Seasons, limits and shooting hours for waterfowl, coots, and gallinules.

This section provides for the annual hunting of certain waterfowl (ducks, geese [including brant]), coots and gallinules in the 48 contiguous United States. The regulations are arranged by the Atlantic, Mississippi, Central and Pacific Flyways. These regulations often vary within Flyways or States, and by time periods. Those areas of the United States outside of State boundaries, *i.e.*, the United States' territorial waters seaward of county boundaries, and including coastal waters claimed by the separate States, if not already included under the zones contained in ยง 20.108, are designated for the purposes of ยง 20.21(j) as nontoxic shot zones for waterfowl hunting beginning in the 1991-92 season.
