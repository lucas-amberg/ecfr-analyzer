Any authorized person may temporarily possess, transport, and dispose of Muscovy ducks taken under this order.

You may not retain for personal use or consumption, offer for sale, or sell a Muscovy duck removed under authority of this section, nor may you release it in any other location.


(d) *Other provisions.* (1) You must comply with any State, territorial, or Tribal laws or regulations governing the removal or destruction of Muscovy ducks or their nests or eggs.


(2) You may not remove or destroy Muscovy ducks or their nests or eggs if doing so will adversely affect other migratory birds or species designated as endangered or threatened under the authority of the Endangered Species Act. If you use a firearm to kill Muscovy ducks under the provisions of this section, you must use nontoxic shot or nontoxic bullets to do so.


(3) If you operate under this order, you must immediately report the take of any species protected under the Endangered Species Act, or any other bird species protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, to the Fish and Wildlife Service Ecological Services Office for the State or location in which the take occurred.
