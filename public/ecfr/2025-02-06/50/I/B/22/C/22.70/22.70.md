# § 22.70   Eagle falconry permits.

(a) *Use of golden eagles in falconry.* If you meet the conditions outlined in § 21.82(c)(3)(iv) of this part, and you have a permit to possess a golden eagle (*Aquila chrysaetos*) from your State, tribe, or territory, we consider your permit sufficient for the purposes of the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 668-668d), subject to the requirement that take of golden eagles for falconry is compatible with the preservation of the golden eagle.


(b) *Transfer of golden eagles trapped by government employees to other permittees.* If you have the necessary permit(s) from your State, tribe, or territory, a government employee who has trapped a golden eagle under a Federal depredation permit or under a depredation control order may transfer the bird to you if he or she cannot release the eagle in an appropriate location. A golden eagle may only be taken from a livestock or wildlife depredation area declared by USDA Wildlife Services and permitted under § 22.100, or from a livestock depredation area authorized in accordance with Subpart D—Provisions for Depredating Eagles.
