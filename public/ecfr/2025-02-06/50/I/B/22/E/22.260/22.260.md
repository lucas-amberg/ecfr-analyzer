# § 22.260   Permits for incidental take of eagles by power lines.

(a) *Purpose.* The regulations in this section authorize the incidental killing or injury of bald eagles and golden eagles associated with power line activities. Apply using Form 3-200-71.


(b) *Definitions.* The following terms used in this section have the meanings set forth in this paragraph (b):


*Avian-safe.* A power-pole configuration designed to minimize avian electrocution risk by providing sufficient separation between phases and between phases and grounds to accommodate the wrist-to-wrist or head-to-foot distance of the bird. For eagles, this is 150 centimeters of horizontal separation and 100 centimeters of vertical separation. If sufficient separation cannot be provided, exposed parts that conduct electricity must be covered to reduce electrocution risk. If covers are used, they must be maintained in good condition. For conversions from an above-ground line to a buried line, the buried portion is considered “avian-safe.” For purposes of the regulations in this section, “avian-safe” means safe for eagles.


*Collision response strategy.* A plan that describes the process the permittee will follow to identify whether a collision-caused injury or mortality has occurred, to evaluate factors that contributed to the collision, and to implement risk-reduction measures commensurate with the collision risk.


*Proactive retrofit strategy.* A plan to convert existing infrastructure to avian-safe infrastructure within a set timeline. The strategy must identify a baseline of poles to be proactively retrofit. The existing-infrastructure baseline must include all poles that are not avian-safe for eagles located in areas identified as high risk to eagles and may also include other poles in the service area.


*Reactive retrofit strategy.* A plan to respond to incidents where eagles are electrocuted or killed. The reactive retrofit strategy must include information on how eagle electrocutions are detected and identified. Determining which poles to retrofit must be based on the risk to eagles and not on other factors (*e.g.,* convenience or cost). The pole that caused the electrocution must be retrofitted unless the pole is already avian-safe. A total of 13 poles or a half-mile segment must be retrofitted, whichever is less, prioritizing the highest risk poles closest to the electrocution event.


*Shooting response strategy.* A plan that describes the process the permittee will follow when eagles are found killed or injured near power-line infrastructure to identify if shooting is suspected, to communicate with law enforcement, and to identify and implement appropriate shooting reduction measures.


(c) *Eligibility for a general permit for incidental take.* To qualify for a general permit, you must meet the requirements of § 22.210.


(d) *General permit conditions for power lines.* Project permittees must:


(1) Develop a reactive retrofit strategy and implement that strategy following each discovery of an electrocuted eagle. The investigation, documentation, and retrofit design selection must be completed within 90 days of the incident. The retrofit must be implemented within 1 year of the incident and remain effective for 30 years.


(2) Implement a proactive retrofit strategy to convert all existing-infrastructure-baseline poles to avian-safe. Retrofits must remain effective for 30 years.


(i) Investor-owned utilities must retrofit all existing-infrastructure-baseline poles within 50 years. Ten percent of baseline poles must be converted to avian-safe during each permit tenure unless extenuating circumstances apply.


(ii) Non-investor-owned utilities must retrofit all existing-infrastructure-baseline poles within 75 years. Seven percent of baseline poles must be converted to avian-safe during each permit tenure unless extenuating circumstances apply.


(3) Implement an eagle collision response strategy. Within 90 days of a collision, you must complete an investigation where the collision occurred by documenting the factors contributing to the collision and identifying appropriate risk-reduction measures. You must implement selected risk-reduction measures at the location of the collision within 1 year of the incident.


(4) Implement an eagle shooting response strategy. The strategy must include a protocol for immediately contacting the Office of Law Enforcement (in no case more than 72 hours from discovery) when finding eagle remains or an injured eagle near power line infrastructure in circumstances that suggest the eagle may have been shot. If multiple shooting events occur in the service area during the permit tenure, the strategy should describe and provide for the implementation of reasonable shooting-reduction measures.


(5) Train personnel to scan for eagle remains when onsite and implement internal reporting and recordkeeping procedures for discovered eagles.


(6) Ensure that all new construction and rebuild or replacement of poles in areas of high risk for eagles is avian-safe unless this requirement would unduly impact human health and safety, require overly burdensome engineering, or have significant adverse effects on biological, cultural, or historical resources.


(7) For new construction and rebuild, reconstruction, or replacement projects, incorporate information on eagles into siting and design considerations. Minimize eagle risk by siting away from eagle-use areas (*e.g.,* nests and winter roosts), accounting for the risk to and population status of the species, unless this requirement would unduly impact human health and safety; require overly burdensome engineering; or have significant adverse effects on biological, cultural, or historical resources.


(8) Comply with all relevant regulations and permit conditions of part 21 of this subchapter.


(9) Submit required reports to the Service using Form 3-202-15.


(10) Pay the required application and administration fee as set forth in § 13.11(d)(4) of this subchapter.


(e) *Specific permit for incidental take*—(1) *Eligibility.* Any entity conducting power line activities that meet the requirements of § 22.200 may apply for a specific permit.


(2) *Conditions.* You must comply with the conditions required in § 22.200. Your permit conditions will include the relevant general-permit conditions from paragraph (d) of this section. Compensatory mitigation may be required when appropriate, including if general permit conditions cannot be met.


(f) *Tenure of permits.* Power line general permits are valid for 5 years. Specific permits may be valid for up to 30 years.
