# ยง 23.1   What are the purposes of these regulations and CITES?

(a) *Treaty.* The regulations in this part implement the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, also known as CITES, the Convention, the Treaty, or the Washington Convention, TIAS (Treaties and Other International Acts Series) 8249.


(b) *Purpose.* The aim of CITES is to regulate international trade in wildlife and plants, including parts, products, and derivatives, to ensure it is legal and does not threaten the survival of species in the wild. Parties, recognize that:


(1) Wildlife and plants are an irreplaceable part of the natural systems of the earth and must be protected for this and future generations.


(2) The value of wildlife and plants is ever-growing from the viewpoints of aesthetics, science, culture, recreation, and economics.


(3) Although countries should be the best protectors of their own wildlife and plants, international cooperation is essential to protect wildlife and plant species from over-exploitation through international trade.


(4) It is urgent that countries take appropriate measures to prevent illegal trade and ensure that any use of wildlife and plants is sustainable.


(c) *National legislation.* We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), implement CITES through the Endangered Species Act (ESA).
