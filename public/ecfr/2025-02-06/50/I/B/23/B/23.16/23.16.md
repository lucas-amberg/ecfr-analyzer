# ยง 23.16   What are the U.S. CITES requirements for urine, feces, and synthetically derived DNA?

(a) *CITES documents.* We do not require CITES documents to trade in urine, feces, or synthetically derived DNA.


(1) You must obtain any collection permit and CITES document required by the foreign country.


(2) If the foreign country requires you to have a U.S. CITES document for these kinds of samples, you must apply for a CITES document and meet the requirements of this part.


(b) *Urine and feces.* Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, we consider urine and feces to be wildlife byproducts, rather than parts, products, or derivatives, and exempt them from the requirements of CITES and this part.


(c) *DNA.* We differentiate between DNA directly extracted from blood and tissue and DNA synthetically derived as follows:


(1) A DNA sample directly derived from wildlife or plant tissue is regulated by CITES and this part.


(2) A DNA sample synthetically derived that does not contain any part of the original template is exempt from the requirements of CITES and this part.
