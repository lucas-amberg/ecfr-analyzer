# ยง 23.33   How is the decision made to issue or deny a request for a U.S. CITES document?

(a) Upon receiving a complete application, we will decide whether to issue a CITES document by considering:


(1) The general criteria in ยง 13.21(b) of this subchapter and, if the species is protected under a separate law or treaty, criteria in any other applicable parts.


(2) The CITES issuance criteria provided in this subpart (see subpart D of this part for factors we consider in making certain findings).


(b) As needed, the U.S. Management Authority, including FWS Law Enforcement, will forward a copy of the application to the U.S. Scientific Authority; State, tribal, or other Federal government agencies; or other applicable experts. We may also query the Secretariat and foreign Management and Scientific Authorities for information to use in making the required findings.


(c) You must provide sufficient information to satisfy us that all criteria specific to the proposed activity are met before we can issue a CITES document.


(d) We will base our decision on whether to issue or deny the application on the best available information.
