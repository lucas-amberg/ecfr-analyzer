# ยง 23.34   What kinds of records may I use to show the origin of a specimen when I apply for a U.S. CITES document?

(a) When you apply for a U.S. CITES document, you will be asked to provide information on the origin of the specimen that will be covered by the CITES document.


(1) You need to provide sufficient information for us to determine if the issuance criteria in this part are met (see the sections in this subpart for each type of CITES document).


(2) We require less detailed information when the import, introduction from the sea, export, or re-export poses a low risk to a species in the wild and more detailed information when the proposed activity poses greater risk to a species in the wild (see Subpart D of this part for factors we consider in making certain findings). 


(b) Information you may want to provide in a permit application includes, but is not limited to, the following:




(c) If you intend to engage in international trade with a CITES specimen in the future, you should keep sufficient records to establish your eligibility for a CITES document for as long as you possess the specimen, and if you sell, donate, or transfer ownership of the specimen, you should provide such records on the origin of the specimen to the new owner.
