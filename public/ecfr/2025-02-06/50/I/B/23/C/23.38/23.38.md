# ยง 23.38   What are the requirements for a certificate of origin?

(a) *Purpose.* Article V(3) of the Treaty requires that a shipment of Appendix-III specimens be accompanied by a certificate of origin when the shipment is not from a country that listed the species in Appendix III and is not a re-export.


(b) *U.S. application forms.* For a certificate of origin, complete one of the following forms and submit it to the U.S. Management Authority:


(1) Form 3-200-27 for wildlife removed from the wild.


(2) Form 3-200-24 for captive-born wildlife.


(3) Form 3-200-32 for plants.


(c) *Criteria.* The criteria in this paragraph (c) apply to the issuance and acceptance of U.S. and foreign certificates of origin. When applying for a U.S. certificate, you must provide sufficient information for us to find that your proposed activity meets all of the following criteria:


(1) The specimen originated in the country of export, which is not a country that listed the species in Appendix III. In the case of a listing that is annotated to cover only a certain population, no CITES document is required if the listed population does not occur in the country of export. For U.S. applicants, the country of origin must be the United States.


(2) The scientific name of the species is the standard nomenclature in the CITES Appendices or the references adopted by the CoP (see ยง 23.23).


(3) Live wildlife or plants will be prepared and shipped so as to minimize risk of injury, damage to health, or cruel treatment of the specimen (see ยง 23.23).
