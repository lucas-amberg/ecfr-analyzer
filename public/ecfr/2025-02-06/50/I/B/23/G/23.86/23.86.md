# ยง 23.86   How can I obtain information on a CoP?

As we receive information on an upcoming CoP from the CITES Secretariat, we will notify the public either through published notices in the _Federal Register_ or postings on our website (see ยง 23.7). We will provide:


(a) A summary of the information we have received with an invitation for the public to comment and provide information on the agenda, proposed amendments to the Appendices, and proposed resolutions that they believe the United States should submit for consideration at the CoP.


(b) Information on times, dates, and locations of public meetings.


(c) Information on how international and national organizations may apply to participate as observers.
