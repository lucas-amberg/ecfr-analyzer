# ยง 23.91   How do I find out if a species is listed?

(a) *CITES list.* The official CITES list includes species of wildlife and plants placed in Appendix I, II, and III in accordance with the provisions of Articles XV and XVI of the Treaty. This list is maintained by the CITES Secretariat based on decisions of the Parties. You may access the official list from the CITES website (see ยง 23.7).


(b) *Effective date.* Amendments to the CITES list are effective as follows:


(1) Appendix-I and -II species listings adopted at the CoP are effective 90 days after the last day of the CoP, unless otherwise specified in the proposal.


(2) Appendix-I and -II species listings adopted between CoPs by postal procedures are effective 120 days after the Secretariat has communicated comments and recommendations on the listing to the Parties if the Secretariat does not receive an objection to the proposed amendment from a Party.


(3) Appendix-III species listings are effective 90 days after the date the Secretariat has communicated such listings to the Parties. A listing Party may withdraw a species from the list at any time by notifying the Secretariat. The withdrawal is effective 30 days after the Secretariat has communicated the withdrawal to the Parties.
