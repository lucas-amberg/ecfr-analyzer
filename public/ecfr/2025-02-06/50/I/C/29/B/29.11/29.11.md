# § 29.11   Purpose and scope.

The regulations in this subpart prescribe the procedures for filing applications and the terms and conditions under which rights-of-way over and across the lands administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may be permitted.


(a) *National Wildlife Refuge System lands except lands in Alaska.* Applications are submitted under authority of Public Law 89-669, as amended (80 Stat. 926; 16 U.S.C. 668dd), or for oil and gas pipelines under section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended (30 U.S.C. 181 *et seq.*), following the application procedures set out in § 29.15. The Service will not issue a right-of-way permit for a requested use that would conflict with the goals or objectives in an approved refuge management plan, nor will the Service issue a right-of-way permit unless the use is a compatible use as described in § 29.13. See § 29.24 for additional requirements applicable to rights-of-way for electric power transmission lines and § 29.25 for additional requirements applicable to rights-of-way for pipelines for the transportation of oil, natural gas, synthetic liquid, or gaseous fuels, or any refined product produced from these substances.


(b) *National Wildlife Refuge System lands in Alaska.* Applications for rights-of-way authorized under ANILCA (see 16 U.S.C. 3162(B)) must be submitted under authority of 16 U.S.C. 3101 *et seq.* and follow the procedures and requirements set forth in 43 CFR part 36 and other applicable Refuge laws and regulations where they do not conflict with ANILCA. Applications for all other rights-of-way on or over lands in Alaska must be submitted under authority of 16 U.S.C. 668dd, as amended, or for oil and gas pipelines under section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended (30 U.S.C. 181 *et seq.*), following the application procedures set out in § 29.15, except that compatibility determinations for Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act 22(g) lands shall follow the procedures in § 25.21(b)(1) of this chapter.


(c) *National Fish Hatchery System lands.* Applications for rights-of-way across National Fish Hatchery System lands follow the same procedures as applications for rights-of-way across National Wildlife Refuge System lands in this section.


(d) *National Wildlife Refuge System lands—less than fee interest.* The Service requires permits for rights-of-way that affect a property interest acquired by the United States. If the requested right-of-way or regular maintenance of the requested right-of-way may affect the United States' interest, then an application for a right-of-way permit must be submitted in accordance with procedures set forth in § 29.15, except those applications for rights-of-way authorized under ANILCA (see 16 U.S.C. 3162(B)) will follow the procedures set forth in 43 CFR part 36. If the Regional Director determines that the proposed right-of-way and regular maintenance of the proposed right-of-way will not affect the United States' interest, then the Regional Director will sign a letter to the applicant stating that the proposed right-of-way will not affect the interest of the United States and the Service has no objection to the right-of-way.


(e) *Other lands outside the National Wildlife Refuge System and National Fish Hatchery System.* Rights-of-way on or over other lands will be permitted in accordance with controlling authorities cited in 43 CFR part 2800, or for oil and gas pipelines under section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended (30 U.S.C. 181 *et seq.*). See § 29.24 for additional requirements applicable to rights-of-way for electric power transmission lines and § 29.25 for additional requirements applicable to rights-of-way for pipelines for the transportation of oil, natural gas, synthetic liquid, or gaseous fuels, or any other refined product produced from those substances. Applications must be submitted in accordance with procedures set out in § 29.15, except that the compatibility-determination requirement in § 29.13 does not apply to lands outside the National Wildlife Refuge System and National Fish Hatchery System.
