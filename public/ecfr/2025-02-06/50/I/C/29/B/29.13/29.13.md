# ยง 29.13   Compatibility-determination requirement.

The Service will not issue or renew a right-of-way permit across National Wildlife Refuge System land if the use would conflict with the goals or objectives in an approved refuge management plan. The Service will not issue or renew a right-of-way permit across National Wildlife Refuge System land unless the agency determines that the use is a compatible use in accordance with the requirements and procedures of ยง  25.21 of this chapter. The requirements and procedures of ยง  26.41(c) of this chapter apply to any requested maintenance of or modifications to an existing right-of-way except as modified by any other prevailing provision of law. None of the requirements in this subpart apply to the access of privately owned minerals or to activities explicitly authorized by a permanent right or right-of-way obtained prior to acquisition by the United States, nor do they apply when access is required by any other prevailing provision of law. No compatibility determination is necessary to permit or renew a right-of-way across lands outside the National Wildlife Refuge System and National Fish Hatchery System.
