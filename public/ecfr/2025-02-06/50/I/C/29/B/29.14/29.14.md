# ยง 29.14   Preapplication meeting.

Before submitting an application for a new right-of-way permit or a modification of an existing right-of-way permit across lands managed by the Service, a potential applicant must contact the appropriate Regional Director to schedule a preapplication meeting with the Service. Contact information for the Service Regional Offices is available at *https://www.regulations.gov* in Docket No. FWS-HQ-NWRS-2019-0017. There is no fee for the preapplication meeting. During the meeting, the potential applicant may ask questions about the application process, provide information about the scope of the requested right-of-way permit and its location, and receive feedback. The Service will advise the potential applicant about documentation needed to make an application complete and provide the potential applicant with an expected timeline and potential costs to review and process the application.
