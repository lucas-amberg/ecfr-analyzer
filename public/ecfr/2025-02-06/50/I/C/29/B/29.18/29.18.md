(a) *Application evaluation and processing activities.* (1) Unless reimbursement is waived as provided under paragraph (c) of this section, the applicant for a right-of-way permit must reimburse the United States for the costs the Service incurs in evaluating and processing the application, even if the result of this evaluation is a denial of the application.

(ii) If the applicant or the applicant's contractor will prepare the environmental assessment or environmental impact statement necessary to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 *et seq.*) and other applicable laws, then the Service shall require no reimbursement for National Environmental Policy Act compliance with exception to the costs the Service incurs to ensure that the materials meet agency requirements.

(3) After receiving a complete application, the Regional Director will estimate the Service's application evaluation and processing costs using the information the applicant provided in the application and during or after the preapplication meeting.


(4) Unless reimbursement is waived as provided under paragraph (c) of this section, the applicant must submit a payment to reimburse the Service for its estimated costs before the Service will evaluate and process the right-of-way permit application.


(5) If the Service's cost to evaluate and process the right-of-way application exceeds the estimated amount, the Regional Director will promptly notify the applicant of the deficient amount, and the applicant must submit payment for the deficient amount before the Service will issue a right-of-way permit. The Regional Director will refund any overpayments at the request of the applicant.


(b) *Monitoring activities.* (1) By accepting a permit under this subpart, the permit holder agrees to reimburse the Service for the costs incurred for all monitoring activities, which include monitoring the construction, operation, maintenance, and termination of facilities, to ensure compliance with the terms, conditions, and stipulations of the right-of-way permit.

The Regional Director will provide the permit holder with written notice of intent to impose new charges to reflect current monitoring costs commencing with the ensuing charge year. The revised charges will be effective unless the permit holder files an appeal in accordance with ยง 29.26.
