(3) The permit holder may not transfer or assign the permit to another party without obtaining the Regional Director's prior written approval.


(4) The permit holder may not allow another party to collocate equipment or activities on their infrastructure or right-of-way unless the other party first obtains a right-of-way permit from the Service.

In the event of noncompliance or abandonment, the Regional Director will notify the permit holder in writing of any intention to suspend or terminate the permit 60 days from the date of the notice and state the reasons, unless prior to that time the holder completes such corrective actions as are specified in the notice. The Regional Director may allow an extension of time within which to complete corrective actions if the Regional Director believes that extenuating circumstances, not within the permit holder's control, such as adverse weather conditions, disturbance to wildlife during breeding periods or periods of peak concentration, or other compelling reasons, warrant an extension.


(ii) Should the holder of a right-of-way permit issued under authority of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended (30 U.S.C. 181 *et seq.*), fail to take corrective action within the 60-day period, the Regional Director will provide for an administrative proceeding, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 554, prior to a final departmental decision to suspend or terminate the permit. In the case of all other right-of-way permit holders, failure to take corrective action within the 60-day period will result in a determination by the Regional Director to suspend or terminate the permit.

Any facilities or equipment not removed within 6 months, unless more time is deemed necessary for conservation purposes by the Regional Director, will be deemed abandoned and will be disposed of in accordance with applicable Federal law. In that event, the permit holder will be liable to the Service for all of its costs in disposing of the facilities or equipment and restoring the permitted area.

Required permit modifications could include but are not limited to changes to permit conditions and/or additional stipulations that a Regional Director deems necessary based on new information.


(d) *Terms and conditions required of most permit holders.* The permit holder must also agree to the following terms and conditions, which are required unless the Regional Director determines they are not relevant to the proposed use:

(2) The permit holder must notify the Service project manager in writing at least 5 business days before conducting any maintenance or nonemergency repair work within the permitted area. The written notice must describe the location of the proposed work, the equipment to be used, and the size of work crews anticipated to be working on Service land. The Service project manager may require an onsite meeting before any maintenance or nonemergency repair work commences and may assign a site monitor to be present during such work.

(8) The permit holder must provide for habitat connectivity on the land covered by the permit to the maximum extent possible, for example through use of wildlife-friendly fencing, perches or perch deterrents for birds, fish-passable culverts, vegetative screening or hiding cover, that the Service project manager in charge requests.


(9) The permit holder must promptly notify the Service project manager in charge of the amount of merchantable timber, if any, that will be cut, removed, or destroyed in the construction and maintenance of the project, and to pay the United States in advance of construction such sum of money that the project manager determines to be the full stumpage value of the timber to be cut, removed, or destroyed.


(10) Issuance of the permit is subject to the express condition that the exercise of the permit will not unduly interfere with the management, administration, or disposal by the United States of the land to be affected. The permit holder agrees and consents to the occupancy and use by the United States, or its grantees, permittees, or lessees, of any part of the permit area not actually occupied for the purpose of the permitted rights to the extent that the use does not unreasonably interfere with the permit holder's use of the permitted area.


(11) Any facility constructed on the permit area will be modified or adapted, if modification is found by the Regional Director to be necessary, without liability or expense to the United States, so that the facility will not conflict with the use and occupancy of the land for any authorized works that may be constructed on the land under the authority of the United States. The modification will be planned and scheduled so as not to interfere unduly with or to have minimal effect upon continuity of energy and delivery requirements for Service facilities.


(e) *General liability insurance.* The Service may require the permit holder to procure and maintain in force and effect during the term of the permit commercial general liability insurance to protect against claims arising out of the acts or omissions of the permit holder or its officers, employees, agents, or representatives while conducting the activities authorized by the permit. The insurance policy must also provide coverage for discharges or escapes of pollutants or contaminants into the environment, including sudden or accidental discharges or escapes. The Regional Director will determine the minimum amount of coverage per occurrence and in the aggregate.

Before the Regional Director executes the permit, the applicant must provide the Service with a copy of its certificate of insurance showing the required coverage.


(f) *Bonds.* The Service may require a bond for a permit when the Regional Director determines that the Service is likely to incur reclamation costs during or after the term of the right-of-way due to the construction, operation, or maintenance of the right-of-way. The Service also may require a bond for a permit when the Service is likely to incur reclamation costs if the right-of-way is abandoned or terminated.


(1) No bond will be required of a Federal, State, or local government or its agent or instrumentality, except those that are:


(i) Using the facility, system, space, or any part of the right-of-way area for commercial purposes; or


(ii) A municipal utility or cooperative whose principal source of revenue is customer charges.


(2) When the Service requires a bond, the permit holder must agree to the following terms and conditions: Before the permit's effective date, the permit holder must file with the Service a performance bond payable to the Service, issued by a surety satisfactory to the Service, to guarantee its compliance with all terms and conditions of the permit and with all applicable laws and regulations.

These terms and conditions are not applicable to neutral host providers, sometimes referred to as tower companies, that own and maintain tower or support structures but do not operate or maintain wireless communications equipment on those structures.


(1) The permit holder agrees that use of wireless communications equipment is contingent upon the possession of a valid Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) authorization/license (if required), and the operation of the equipment is in strict compliance with applicable requirements of FCC or NTIA. A copy of each applicable license or authorization must be maintained at all times by the permit holder for each transmitter being operated. The permit holder must provide the Service project manager, when requested, with current copies of all licenses for equipment in or on facilities covered by the permit.


(2) The permit holder must, at the permit holder's sole cost and expense, take all necessary actions to comply with all applicable FCC radio frequency (RF) exposure regulations and requirements, and take reasonable precautions so that neither workers nor the public are subject to RF exposures above the FCC specific levels.


(3) The permit holder agrees that the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 431 (contracts by Member of Congress) and 41 U.S.C. 6306 (prohibition on Members of Congress making contracts with the Federal Government) apply to the permit, as if set forth in full.
