(a) *Change in jurisdiction over and disposal of lands.* The final disposal by the United States of any tract of land traversed by a right-of-way shall not be construed to be a revocation of the right-of-way in whole or in part, but such final disposition shall be deemed and taken to be subject to such right-of-way unless it has been specifically canceled.


(b) *Transfer of permit.* Any proposed transfer, by assignment, lease, operating agreement or otherwise, of a permit must be filed with the Regional Director and must be supported by a stipulation that the transferee agrees to comply with and be bound by the terms and conditions of the original permit. A $100 nonrefundable service fee must accompany the proposal. No transfer will occur unless and until approved in writing by the Regional Director.


(c) *Disposal of property on termination of right-of-way.* In the absence of any agreement to the contrary:


(1) The holder of the right-of-way must, within 6 months after termination of the right-of-way, remove all property or improvements placed there by the holder, other than a road and usable improvements to a road.


(2) After 6 months, all property and improvements in the right-of-way area become the property of the United States.


(3) The Regional Director may use discretion to extend this timeframe.
