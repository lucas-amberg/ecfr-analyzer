# ยง 29.40   What are the purpose and scope of the regulations in this subpart?

(a) The purpose of this subpart is to ensure that operators exercising non-Federal oil and gas rights within the National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) outside of Alaska use technologically feasible, least damaging methods to:


(1) Protect Service-administered lands and waters, and resources of refuges;


(2) Protect refuge wildlife-dependent recreational uses and experiences and visitor or employee health and safety; and


(3) Conserve refuges for the benefit of present and future generations of Americans.


(b) This subpart applies to all operators conducting non-Federal oil and gas operations outside of Alaska on Service-administered lands held in fee or less-than fee (excluding coordination areas) or Service-administered waters to the extent necessary to protect those property interests. These regulations do not apply to non-Federal surface locations within the boundaries of a refuge (*i.e.,* inholdings), except to the extent that activities associated with those operations, including access to an inholding, occur on Service-administered lands or waters.


(c) This subpart is not intended to result in a taking of any property interest. The purpose of this subpart is to reasonably regulate operations to protect Service-administered lands and waters, resources of refuges, visitor uses and experiences, and visitor or employee health and safety.
