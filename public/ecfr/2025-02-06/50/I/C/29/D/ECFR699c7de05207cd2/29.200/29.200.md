# ยง 29.200   Can I, as operator, appeal Service decisions?

Yes. If you disagree with a decision made by the Service under this subpart, you may use the appeals process in ยง 25.45 of this subchapter. The process set forth in ยง 25.45 will be used for appeal of any written decision concerning approval, denial, or modification of an operation made by the Service under this subpart. No Service decision under this subpart that is subject to appeal to the Regional Director or the Director shall be considered final agency action subject to judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 704 until the Regional Director has rendered his or her decision on the matter. The decision of the Regional Director will constitute the Service's final agency action, and no further appeal will lie in the Department from that decision.
