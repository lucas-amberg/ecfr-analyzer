(a) You must promptly clean up and remove from the refuge any released contaminating substances in accordance with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws.


(b) You must perform partial reclamation of areas that are no longer necessary to conduct operations. You must begin final reclamation within 6 months after you complete your authorized operations unless we authorize a different reclamation period in writing.


(c) You must protect all survey markers (*e.g.,* monuments, witness corners, reference monuments, and bearing trees) against destruction, obliteration, or damage from operations. You are responsible for reestablishment, restoration, and referencing of any monuments, corners, and bearing trees that are destroyed, obliterated, or damaged by your operations.


(d) You must complete reclamation by:


(1) Plugging all wells;


(2) Removing all above-ground structures, equipment, roads, and all other manmade material and debris resulting from operations;


(3) Removing or neutralizing any contaminating substances;


(4) Reestablishing native vegetative communities, or providing for conditions where ecological processes typical of the ecological zone (*e.g.,* plant or wildlife succession) will reestablish themselves;


(5) Grading to conform the contours to pre-existing elevations as necessary to maximize ecological function;


(6) Restoring conditions to pre-disturbance hydrologic movement and functionality;


(7) Restoring natural systems using native soil material that is similar in character to the adjacent undisturbed soil profiles;


(8) Ensuring that reclamation does not interfere with visitor use or with administration of the refuge;


(9) Attaining conditions that are consistent with the management objectives of the refuge, designed to meet the purposes for which the refuge was established; and


(10) Coordinating with us or with other operators who may be using a portion of your area of operations to ensure proper and equitable apportionment of reclamation responsibilities.
