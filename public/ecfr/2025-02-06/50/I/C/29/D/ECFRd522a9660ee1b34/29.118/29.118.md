# ยง 29.118   What additional operating standards apply to geophysical operations?

If you conduct geophysical operations, you must do all of the following:


(a) Use surveying methods that minimize the need for vegetative trimming and removal.


(b) Locate source points using industry-accepted minimum safe-offset distances from pipelines, telephone lines, railroad tracks, roads, power lines, water wells, oil and gas wells, oil- and gas-production facilities, and buildings.


(c) Use equipment and methods that, based upon the specific environment, will minimize impacts to Service-administered lands and waters, and resources of refuges; visitor uses and experiences; and visitor and employee health and safety.


(d) If you use shot holes, you must:


(1) Use biodegradable charges;


(2) Plug all shot holes to prevent a pathway for migration for fluids along any portion of the bore; and


(3) Leave the site in a clean and safe condition that will not impede surface reclamation or pose a hazard to wildlife or human health and safety.
