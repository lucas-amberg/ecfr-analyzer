(e) The location of existing structures that your operations could affect, including buildings, pipelines, oil and gas wells including both producing and plugged and abandoned wells, injection wells, freshwater wells, underground and overhead electrical lines, and other utility lines.


(f) Descriptions of the natural and cultural resource conditions from your reconnaissance survey reports or other sources collected for your proposed area of operations, including any baseline testing of soils and surface and near-surface ground waters within your area of operations that reasonably may be impacted by your surface operations.


(g) Locations map(s) (to-scale and determined by us to be acceptable) that clearly identifies:


(1) Proposed area of operations, existing conditions, and proposed new surface uses, including the boundaries of each of your oil and gas tracts in relation to your proposed operations and the relevant refuge boundary.


(2) Proposed access routes of new surface disturbances as determined by a location survey.


(3) Proposed location of all support facilities, including those for transportation (*e.g.,* vehicle parking areas, helicopter pads, etc.), sanitation, occupation, staging areas, fuel storage areas, refueling areas, loading docks, water supplies, and disposal facilities.


(h) The method and diagrams, including cross-sections, of any proposed pad construction, road construction, cut-and-fill areas, and surface maintenance, including erosion control.


(i) The number and types of equipment and vehicles, including an estimate of vehicular round trips associated with your operation.


(j) An estimated timetable for the proposed operations, including any operational timing constraints.


(k) The type and extent of security measures proposed at your area of operations.


(l) The power sources and their transmission systems for the proposed operations.


(m) The types and quantities of all solid and liquid waste generated and the proposed methods of storage, handling, and disposal.


(n) The source, quantity, access route, and transportation/conveyance method for all water to be used in operations, including hydraulic fracturing, and estimations of any anticipated wastewater volumes generated, including flowback fluids from hydraulic fracturing, and the proposed methods of storage, handling, and recycling or disposal.


(o) The following information regarding mitigation actions and alternatives considered:


(1) A description of the steps you propose to take to mitigate anticipated adverse environmental impacts on refuge resources and uses, including, but not limited to, the refuge's land features, land uses, fish and wildlife, vegetation, soils, surface and subsurface water resources, air quality, noise, lightscapes, viewsheds, cultural resources, and economic environment.


(2) A description of any anticipated impacts that you cannot mitigate.


(3) A description of alternatives considered that meet the criteria of technologically feasible, least damaging methods of operations, as well as the costs and environmental effects of such alternatives.


(p) You must submit the following information about your spill control and emergency preparedness plan. You may use a spill prevention control and countermeasure plan prepared under 40 CFR part 112 if the plan includes all of the information required by this section. You must submit:


(1) The names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the people whom the Service can contact in the event of a spill, fire, or accident, including the order in which the individuals should be contacted.


(2) The notification procedures and steps taken to minimize damage in the event of a spill, fire, or accident.


(3) Identification of contaminating substances used within your area of operations or expected to be encountered during operations.


(4) Trajectory analysis for potential spills that are not contained on location.


(5) Identification of abnormal pressure, temperature, toxic gases or substances, or other hazardous conditions at your area of operations or expected to be encountered during operations.


(6) Measures (*e.g.,* procedures, facility design, equipment) to minimize risks to human health and safety, and the environment.


(7) Steps to prevent accumulations of oil or other materials deemed to be fire hazards from occurring in the vicinity of well locations and lease tanks.


(8) The equipment and methods for containment and cleanup of contaminating substances, including a description of the equipment available at your area of operations and equipment available from local contractors.


(9) A stormwater drainage plan and actions intended to mitigate stormwater runoff.


(10) Material safety data sheets for each material you will use or encounter during operations, including expected quantities maintained at your area of operations.


(11) A description of the emergency actions you will take in the event of injury or death to fish and wildlife or vegetation.


(12) A description of the emergency actions you will take in the event of accidents causing human injury.


(13) Contingency plans for conditions and emergencies other than spills, such as if your area of operations is located in areas prone to hurricanes, flooding, tornadoes, fires, or earthquakes.


(q) A description of the specific equipment, materials, methods, and schedule that will be used to meet the operating standards for reclamation at ยง 29.117.


(r) An itemized list of the estimated costs that a third party would charge to complete reclamation.
