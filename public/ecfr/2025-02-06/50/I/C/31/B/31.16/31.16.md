Lands acquired as “waterfowl production areas” shall be open to public trapping without Federal permit provided that trapping on all or part of individual areas may be temporarily suspended by posting upon occasions of unusual or critical conditions affecting land, water, vegetation, or wildlife populations. Each person trapping on any wildlife refuge area shall possess the required State license or permit and shall comply with the provisions of State laws and regulations.
