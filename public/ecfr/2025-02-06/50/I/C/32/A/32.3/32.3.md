# § 32.3   What are the procedures for publication of refuge-specific hunting regulations?

(a) Refuge-specific hunting regulations are issued only at the time of or after the determination and publication of the opening of a wildlife refuge area to migratory game bird, upland game or big game hunting.


(b) Refuge-specific hunting regulations may contain the following items:


(1) Wildlife species that may be hunted;


(2) Seasons;


(3) Bag limits;


(4) Methods of hunting;


(5) Description of areas open to hunting; or


(6) Other provisions as required.


(c) Refuge-specific hunting regulations will not liberalize existing State laws or regulations.


(d) Refuge-specific hunting regulations are subject to change and the public is invited to submit suggestions and comments for consideration at any time.


(e) We initially publish refuge-specific hunting regulations in the daily issue of the _Federal Register,_ and subsequently they appear in §§ 32.20 through 32.72, except that the refuge manager may adopt and issue relevant refuge-specific season dates and times after the State establishes its hunting seasons by publication through one or more of the methods identified in § 25.31 of this subchapter C. 


(f) Refuge-specific hunting regulations may be amended or new conditions imposed at any time during the hunting season when unpredictable changes occur in wildlife populations, habitat conditions or in other factors affecting a refuge's wildlife resources. Changes in refuge-specific hunting regulations made under the conditions noted in this paragraph (f) can be in force only for the one season to which the changes apply.
