Public uses of a wilderness unit will be in accordance with the purposes for which the individual national wildlife refuge was established and is administered and laws and regulations governing public uses within the National Wildlife Refuge System.

(b) All persons entering a wilderness unit will be required to remove such materials as they carry in.
