# ยง 36.12   Use of snowmobiles, motorboats, dog teams and other means of surface transportation traditionally employed by local rural residents engaged in subsistence uses.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of subchapter C of title 50 CFR the use of snowmobiles, motorboats, dog teams and other means of surface transportation traditionally employed by local rural residents engaged in subsistence uses is permitted within Alaska National Wildlife Refuges except at those times and in those areas restricted or closed by the Refuge Manager.


(b) The Refuge Manager may restrict or close a route or area to the use of snowmobiles, motorboats, dog teams or other means of surface transportation traditionally employed by local rural residents engaged in subsistence uses if the Refuge Manager determines that such use is causing or is likely to cause an adverse impact on public health and safety, resource protection, protection of historic or scientific values, subsistence uses, conservation of endangered or threatened species, or other purposes and values for which the refuge was established.


(c) No restrictions or closures shall be imposed without notice and a public hearing in the affected vicinity and other locations as appropriate. In the case of emergency situations, restrictions or closures shall not exceed sixty (60) days and shall not be extended unless the Refuge Manager establishes, after notice and public hearing in the affected vicinity and other locations as appropriate, that such extension is justified according to the factors set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Notice of the proposed or emergency restrictions or closures and the reasons therefor shall be published in at least one newspaper of general circulation within the State and in at least one local newspaper if available, and information about such proposed or emergency actions shall also be made available for broadcast on local radio stations in a manner reasonably calculated to inform local rural residents in the affected vicinity. All restrictions and closures shall be designated on a map which shall be available for public inspection at the office of the Refuge Manager of the affected refuge and the post office or postal authority of every affected community within or near the refuge area, or by the posting of signs in the vicinity of the restrictions or closures, or both.


(d) Snowmobiles, motorboats, dog teams and other means of surface transportation traditionally employed by local rural residents engaged in subsistence uses shall be operated (1) in compliance with applicable State and Federal law, (2) in such a manner as to prevent waste or damage to the refuge, and (3) in such a manner as to prevent the herding, harassment, hazing or driving of wildlife for hunting or other purposes.


(e) At all times when not engaged in subsistence uses, local rural residents may use snowmobiles, motorboats, dog teams and other means of surface transportation in accordance with subpart C of this part.
