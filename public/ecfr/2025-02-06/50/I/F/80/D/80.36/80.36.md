# ยง 80.36   May an agency count license holders in the annual certification if the agency receives funds from the State or another entity to cover their license fees?

If a State fish and wildlife agency receives funds from the State or other entity to cover fees for some license holders, the agency may count those license holders in the annual certification only under the following conditions:


(a) The State funds to cover license fees must come from a source other than hunting- and fishing-license revenue.


(b) The State must identify funds to cover license fees separately from other funds provided to the agency.


(c) The agency must receive at least the average amount of State-provided discretionary funds that it received for the administration of the State's fish and wildlife agency during the State's 5 previous fiscal years.


(1) State-provided discretionary funds are those from the State's general fund that the State may increase or decrease if it chooses to do so.


(2) Some State-provided funds are from special taxes, trust funds, gifts, bequests, or other sources specifically dedicated to the support of the State fish and wildlife agency. These funds typically fluctuate annually due to interest rates, sales, or other factors. They are not discretionary funds for purposes of this part as long as the State does not take any action to reduce the amount available to its fish and wildlife agency.


(d) The agency must receive and account for the State or other entity funds as license revenue.


(e) The agency must issue licenses in the license holder's name or by using a unique identifier that is traceable to the license holder, who is verifiable in State records.


(f) The license fees must meet all other requirements in this part.
