# ยง 80.65   Does an agency have to allocate funds between marine and freshwater fisheries projects?

Yes. Each coastal State's fish and wildlife agency must equitably allocate the funds apportioned under the Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act between projects with benefits for marine fisheries and projects with benefits for freshwater fisheries.


(a) The subprograms authorized by the Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act do not have to allocate funding in the same manner as long as the State fish and wildlife agency equitably allocates Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration funds as a whole between marine and freshwater fisheries.


(b) The coastal States for purposes of this allocation are:


(1) Alabama, Alaska, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, and Washington;


(2) The Commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands; and


(3) The territories of Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa.
