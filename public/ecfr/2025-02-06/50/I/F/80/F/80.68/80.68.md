The following conditions apply to financing an activity from more than one annual apportionment:

If an agency does not complete the project, it must recover any expended Federal funds that did not result in commensurate wildlife or sport-fishery benefits. The agency must then reallocate the recovered funds to approved projects in the same program.


(b) The project statement included with the application must have a complete schedule of payments to finish the project.


(c) Interest and other financing costs may be allowable subject to the restrictions in the applicable Federal Cost Principles.
