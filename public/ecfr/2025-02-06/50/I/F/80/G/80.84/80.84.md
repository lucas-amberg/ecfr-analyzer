# ยง 80.84   How does the Service establish the non-Federal share of allowable costs?

(a) To establish the non-Federal share of a grant-funded project for the 50 States, the Regional Director approves an application for Federal assistance in which the State fish and wildlife agency proposes the specific non-Federal share by estimating the Federal and match dollars, consistent with ยง 80.83(a).


(b) To establish the non-Federal share of a grant-funded project for the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Regional Director:


(1) Decides which percentage is fair, just, and equitable for the Federal share consistent with ยง 80.83(b) through (d);


(2) Subtracts the Federal share percentage from 100 percent to determine the percentage of non-Federal share; and


(3) Applies the percentage of non-Federal share to the allowable costs of a grant-funded project to determine the match requirement.


(c) To establish the non-Federal share of a grant-funded project for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and the territories of Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa, the Regional Director must first calculate a preliminary percentage of non-Federal share in the same manner as described in paragraph (b) of this section. Following 48 U.S.C. 1469a, the Regional Director must then waive the first $200,000 of match to establish the final non-Federal match requirement for a project that includes funding from only one grant program or subprogram. If a project includes funds from more than one grant program or subprogram, the Regional Director must waive the first $200,000 of match applied to the funds for each program and subprogram.
