# ยง 80.130   Does an agency have to hold title to real property acquired under a grant?

A State fish and wildlife agency must hold title to an ownership interest in real property acquired under a grant to the extent possible under State law.


(a) Some States do not authorize their fish and wildlife agency to hold the title to real property that the agency manages. In these cases, the State or one of its administrative units may hold the title to grant-funded real property as long as the agency has the authority to manage the real property for its authorized purpose under the grant. The agency, the State, or another administrative unit of State government must not hold title to an undivided ownership interest in the real property concurrently with a subgrantee or any other entity.


(b) An ownership interest is an interest in real property that gives the person who holds it the right to use and occupy a parcel of land or water and to exclude others. Ownership interests include fee and leasehold interests but not easements.
