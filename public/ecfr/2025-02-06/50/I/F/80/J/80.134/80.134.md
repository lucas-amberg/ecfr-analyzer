(a) If a grant funds acquisition of an interest in a parcel of land or water, the State fish and wildlife agency must use it for the purpose authorized in the grant.


(b) If a grant funds construction of a capital improvement, the agency must use the capital improvement for the purpose authorized in the grant during the useful life of the capital improvement. The agency must do this even if it did not use grant funds to:


(1) Acquire the parcel on which the capital improvement is located; or


(2) Build the structure in which the capital improvement is a component.


(c) If a grant funds management, operation, or maintenance of a parcel of land or water, or a capital improvement, the agency must use it for the purpose authorized in the grant during the grant period. The agency must do this even if it did not acquire the parcel or construct the capital improvement with grant funds.


(d) A State agency may allow commercial, recreational, and other secondary uses of a grant-funded parcel of land or water or capital improvement if these secondary uses do not interfere with the authorized purpose of the grant.
