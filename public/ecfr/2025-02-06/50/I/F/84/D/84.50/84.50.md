# ยง 84.50   How does a State certify compliance with Federal laws, regulations, and policies?

(a) In accepting Federal money, coastal State representatives must agree to and certify compliance with all applicable Federal laws, regulations, and policies. The applicant will need to submit a Statement of Assurances (either SF 424B or SF 424D) signed and dated by an authorized agency representative as part of the proposal. 


(b) Compliance with environmental and other laws, as defined in the Service Manual 523 FW Chapter 1, 
6 may require additional documentation. Consult with Regional Offices for how this applies to a specific project.
