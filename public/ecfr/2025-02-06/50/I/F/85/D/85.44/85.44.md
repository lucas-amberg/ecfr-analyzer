A maximum of a $5.00 fee may be charged, with no justification, for use of pumpout facilities constructed, operated or maintained with grant funds. If higher fees are charged, they must be justified before the proposal can be approved.

The maximum fee shall be evaluated for inflation, etc., each year.
