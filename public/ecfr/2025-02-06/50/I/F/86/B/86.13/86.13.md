# ยง 86.13   What operational and design features must a facility have where a BIG-funded facility is located?

(a) At project completion, a facility where a BIG-funded facility is located must:


(1) Be open to eligible users and operated and maintained for its intended purpose for its useful life;


(2) Clearly designate eligible uses and inform the public of restrictions;


(3) Offer security, safety, and service for eligible users and vessels;


(4) Be accessible by eligible vessels on navigable waters;


(5) Allow public access as described at ยง 86.92;


(6) Have docking or mooring sites with water access at least 6 feet deep at the lowest tide or fluctuation, unless the facility qualifies under paragraph (c) of this section; and


(7) Have an operational pumpout station if:


(i) Eligible vessels stay overnight; and


(ii) Available pumpout service is not located within 2 nautical miles; or


(iii) State or local laws require one on site.


(b) We will waive the pumpout requirement if you show in the grant application the inability to install a pumpout.


(1) We will review your request and will grant the waiver if you present circumstances that show:


(i) A hardship due to lack of utilities or other difficult obstacles, such as a BIG-funded facility on an island with no power or a remote location where the equipment cannot be serviced or maintained regularly;


(ii) State or local law does not allow septic-waste disposal facilities at the location;


(iii) You are in the process of applying for a CVA grant for the same award year as the BIG grant to install a pumpout station as part of the BIG-funded facility; or


(iv) You have received a CVA grant and will install a pumpout station as part of the BIG-funded facility on or before the time the BIG-funded facility is completed.


(2) When we waive the pumpout requirement, the BIG-funded facility must inform boaters:


(i) They are required to properly treat or dispose of septic waste; and


(ii) Where they can find information that will direct them to nearby pumpout stations.


(3) If we deny your request, we will follow the process described in the annual NOFO.


(4) If you seek an allowance based on this paragraph, you must include supporting information in the grant application as described at ยง 86.43(n)(1).


(c) We will allow water access at a depth less than 6 feet if you can show that the BIG-funded facility will serve its intended purpose for typical eligible users that visit that location.


(d) Any of these design features may already be part of the facility, or be funded through another source, and need not be included as part of the BIG project.
