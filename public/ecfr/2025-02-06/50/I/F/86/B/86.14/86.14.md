(b) For BIG Tier 1—State grants:


(1) You may request BIG funds for one-time or as-needed maintenance costs at any BIG-eligible facility as long as the costs are discrete and follow paragraph (a) of this section.


(2) If you use BIG funds for maintenance at a facility that has received a BIG grant in the past, you must extend the useful life of each affected capital improvement accordingly.


(3) States may limit or exclude BIG maintenance funding they make available to subgrantees.
