(2) Allow safe, accessible navigation by eligible vessels to, from, and within the BIG-funded facility; and


(3) Allow eligible vessels to dock safely and securely at transient slips.


(c) You must show in the grant application that:


(1) Dredging is needed to fulfill the purpose and objectives of the proposed project; and


(2) You have allocated the dredging costs between the expected use by eligible vessels and ineligible vessels.


(d) You certify by signing the grant application that you have enough resources to maintain the dredged area at the approved width and depth for the useful life of the BIG-funded facility, under typical conditions.
