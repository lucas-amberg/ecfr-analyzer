# § 86.34   What if a partner is not willing or able to follow through on a match commitment?

(a) You are responsible for all activity and funding commitments in the grant application. If you discover that a partner is not willing or able to meet a grant commitment, you must notify us that you will either:


(1) Replace the original partner with another partner who will deliver the action or the funds to fulfill the commitment as stated in the grant application; or


(2) Give either cash or an in-kind contribution(s) that at least equals the value and achieves the same objective as the partner's original commitment of cash or in-kind contribution.


(b) If a partner is not willing or able to meet a match commitment and you do not have enough money to complete the BIG-funded facility as proposed, you must follow the requirements at §§ 86.44 and 86.100.
