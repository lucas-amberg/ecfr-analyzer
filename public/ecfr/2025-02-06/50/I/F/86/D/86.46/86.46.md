# ยง 86.46   What changes can I make in a grant application after I submit it?

(a) After you submit your grant application, you can add or change information up to the date and time that the applications are due.


(b) After the application due date and before we announce selected projects, you can add or change information in your application only if it does not affect the scope of the project, would not affect the score of the application, and is not a correction (see paragraph (c) of this section).


(1) During this period we may ask you to change the useful life following the requirements at ยง 86.74 or allocation of costs between users of the BIG project following the requirements at ยง 86.19.


(2) If your application proposes using BIG funds for an action we identify as ineligible, we will decide on a case-by-case basis whether we will allow you to change your application to remove identified ineligible costs and if we will consider your application for funding.


(c) You must inform us of any incorrect information in an application as soon as you discover it, either before or after receiving an award.


(d) We may ask you at any point in the application process to:


(1) Clarify, correct, explain, or supplement data and information in the application;


(2) Justify the eligibility of a proposed action; or


(3) Justify the allowability of proposed costs or in-kind contributions.


(e) If you do not respond fully to our questions at paragraph (d) of this section in the time allotted, we may decide not to consider your application for funding.


(f) If your application is competitive, but funding is limited and we cannot fully fund your project, we may tell you the amount of available funds and ask you if you wish to accept the reduced funding amount. We will decide on a case-by-case basis if we will consider changes to the scope of your project based on the reduced funding. Any changes to the scope of a project must not result in reducing the number of points enough to lower your project's ranking position. If you choose to accept the reduced amount, you must amend your application to reflect all changes, including the difference in Federal and non-Federal funding.
