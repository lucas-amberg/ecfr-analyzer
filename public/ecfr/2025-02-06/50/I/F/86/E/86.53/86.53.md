# ยง 86.53   What factors does the Service consider for benefits to eligible users that justify the cost?

(a) We consider these factors in evaluating a proposed project under the criterion at ยง 86.51(a)(2) on whether benefits to eligible users justify the cost:


(1) Total cost of the project;


(2) Total benefits available to eligible users upon completion of the project; and


(3) Reliability of the data and information used to decide benefits relative to costs.


(b) You must support the benefits available to eligible users by clearly describing them in the project statement and explaining how they relate to *Need* at ยง 86.43(a).


(c) We will consider the cost relevant to all benefits to eligible users that are adequately supported in the application. We may consider the availability of preexisting structures and amenities, but only in the context of the need identified at ยง 86.43(a).


(d) Describe in your application any factors that would influence project costs, such as:


(1) The need for specialized materials to meet local codes, address weather or terrain, or extend useful life;
