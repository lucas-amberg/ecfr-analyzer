# ยง 86.54   What does the Service consider when evaluating a project on boater access to significant destinations and services that support transient boater travel?

(a) The degree of access that the BIG-funded facility will give;


(b) The activity, event, or landmark that makes the BIG-funded facility a destination, how well known the attraction is, how long it is available, and how likely it is to attract boaters to the facility; and


(c) The availability of services and safety near the BIG-funded facility, how easily boaters can access them, and how well they serve the needs of eligible users.
