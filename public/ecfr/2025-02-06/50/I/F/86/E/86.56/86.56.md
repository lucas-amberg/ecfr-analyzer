# ยง 86.56   What does the Service consider when evaluating a project that includes more than the minimum match?

(a) When we evaluate a project under the criterion for match at ยง 86.51(b)(1), we consider how much cash the applicant and partners commit above the required minimum match of 25 percent of project costs.


(b) The contribution may be from a State, a single source, or any combination of sources.


(c) We will award points as follows:


(d) We must waive the first $200,000 in match for the entities described at ยง 86.32(a). We will determine the required match by subtracting the waived amount from the required 25 percent match and award points using the table at paragraph (c) of this section.
