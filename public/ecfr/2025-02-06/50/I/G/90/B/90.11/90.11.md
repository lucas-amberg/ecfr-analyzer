Section 1 of the Act of July 3, 1956, as amended (70 Stat. 492; 7 U.S.C. 442-445) provides that the Commodity Credit Corporation shall make available to the Secretary of the Interior such wheat, corn, or other grains, acquired through price support operations and certified by the Corporation to be available for purposes of the Act or in such condition through spoilage or deterioration as not to be desirable for human consumption, as the Secretary shall requisition for the purpose of preventing crop damage by migratory waterfowl. Section 2 of the Act provides that, upon a finding that any area in the United States is threatened with damage to farmers' crops by migratory waterfowl, the Secretary is authorized and directed to requisition from the Commodity Credit Corporation and to make available to Federal, State, or local governmental bodies or officials, or to private organizations or persons, such grain acquired by the Corporation through price support operations in such quantities and subject to such regulations as the Secretary determines will most effectively lure migratory waterfowl away from crop depredations and at the same time not expose such migratory waterfowl to shooting over areas to which the waterfowl have been lured by such feeding programs.
