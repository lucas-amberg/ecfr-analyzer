(1) Federal, State, or local government vessels, personnel, and assets, when necessary, in the course of performing official duties;


(2) Vessel operations necessary to avoid an imminent and serious threat to a person, vessel, or the environment;


(3) Vessels restricted in their ability to maneuver that, because of this restriction, are not able to comply with approach restrictions; or


(4) Activities authorized through a permit or authorization issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service to take humpback whales.
