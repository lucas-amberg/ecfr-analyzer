(1) Approach or remain within 50 yards (45.7 m) of a Hawaiian spinner dolphin by any means;


(2) Swim within 50 yards (45.7 m) of a Hawaiian spinner dolphin;


(3) Cause a vessel, person, or other object to approach or remain within 50 yards (45.7 m) of a Hawaiian spinner dolphin; or


(4) Intercept or place a vessel, person, or other object in the path of a Hawaiian spinner dolphin so that the dolphin approaches within 50 yards (45.7 m) of the vessel, person, or object.


(c) *Exceptions.* The prohibitions of paragraph (b) of this section do not apply to:


(1) Any person who inadvertently comes within 50 yards (45.7 m) of a Hawaiian spinner dolphin or is approached by a spinner dolphin, provided the person makes no effort to engage or pursue the animal and takes immediate steps to move away from the animal;


(2) Any vessel that is underway and is approached by a Hawaiian spinner dolphin, provided the vessel continues normal navigation and makes no effort to engage or pursue the animal. For purposes of this exception, a vessel is defined as a watercraft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water (1 U.S.C. 3); a vessel is underway if it is not made fast to the shore, at anchor, or aground;


(3) Any vessel transiting to or from a port, harbor, or in a restricted channel when a 50-yard (45.7 m) distance will not allow the vessel to maintain safe navigation;


(4) Vessel operations necessary to avoid an imminent and serious threat to a person or vessel;


(5) Any vessel that is anchored or aground and is approached by a Hawaiian spinner dolphin, provided the vessel makes no effort to engage or pursue the animal;


(6) Activities authorized through a permit or authorization issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service to take Hawaiian spinner dolphins;


(7) Federal, State, or local government vessels, aircraft, personnel, and assets when necessary in the course of performing official duties;


(8) Commercial fishing vessels that incidentally take spinner dolphins during the course of commercial fishing operations, provided such vessels operate in compliance with a valid marine mammal authorization in accordance with MMPA section 118(c).


(d) *Affirmative defense.* In connection with any action alleging a violation of this section, any person claiming the benefit of any exemption, exception, or permit listed in paragraph (c) of this section has the burden of proving that the exemption or exception is applicable, or that the permit was granted and was valid and in force at the time of the alleged violation.
