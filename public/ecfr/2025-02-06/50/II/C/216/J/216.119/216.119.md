# ยง 216.119   Expiration and amendment.

(a) The 10-year waiver period begins the first day of the first season after issuance of the initial hunt permit. The waiver and this subpart will expire 10 years after the effective date of the initial hunt permit specified under ยง 216.113(b), unless extended.


(b) If the initial permit begins during a hunt season, resulting in only a partial season being authorized, the Regional Administrator may authorize a partial season that is equivalent in duration to the difference between the partial season in the first hunt year and the full season. This second partial season can only be authorized in the final calendar year during the waiver period.


(c) This subpart may be periodically reviewed and modified as provided in 16 U.S.C. 1373(e).
