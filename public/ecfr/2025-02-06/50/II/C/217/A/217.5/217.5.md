# § 217.5   Mitigation requirements.

When conducting the activities identified in § 217.1(a), the mitigation measures contained in any LOA issued under §§ 216.106 of this chapter and 217.7 must be implemented. These mitigation measures shall include but are not limited to:


(a) General conditions:


(1) A copy of any issued LOA must be in the possession of SCWA, its designees, and work crew personnel operating under the authority of the issued LOA.


(2) If SCWA observes a pup that may be abandoned, it shall contact the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) West Coast Regional Stranding Coordinator immediately and also report the incident to NMFS Office of Protected Resources within 48 hours. Observers shall not approach or move the pup.


(b) SCWA crews shall cautiously approach the haul-out ahead of heavy equipment.


(c) SCWA staff shall avoid walking or driving equipment through the seal haul-out.


(d) Crews on foot shall make an effort to be seen by seals from a distance.


(e) All work shall be completed as efficiently as possible and with the smallest amount of heavy equipment possible.


(f) Boats operating near river haul-outs during monitoring shall be kept within posted speed limits and driven as far from the haul-outs as safely possible.


(g) SCWA shall implement the following mitigation measures during pupping season (March 15-June 30):


(1) SCWA shall maintain a one week no-work period between water level management events (unless flooding is an immediate threat) to allow for an adequate disturbance recovery period. During the no-work period, equipment must be removed from the beach;


(2) A water level management event may not occur for more than two consecutive days unless flooding threats cannot be controlled.


(3) If a pup less than one week old is on the beach where heavy machinery will be used or on the path used to access the work location, the management action shall be delayed until the pup has left the site or the latest day possible to prevent flooding while still maintaining suitable fish rearing habitat. In the event that a pup remains present on the beach in the presence of flood risk, SCWA shall consult with NMFS and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to determine the appropriate course of action. SCWA shall determine if pups less than one week old are on the beach prior to a breaching event.


(4) Physical and biological monitoring shall not be conducted if a pup less than one week old is present at the monitoring site or on a path to the site.
