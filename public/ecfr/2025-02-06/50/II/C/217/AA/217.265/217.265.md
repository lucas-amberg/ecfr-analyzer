# ยง 217.265   Monitoring and reporting requirements.

(a) *Protected species observer (PSO) and passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) operator qualifications.* LOA Holder must implement the following measures applicable to PSOs and PAM operators:


(1) LOA Holder must use independent, NMFS-approved PSOs and PAM operators, meaning that the PSOs and PAM operators must be employed by a third-party observer provider, must have no tasks other than to conduct observational effort, collect data, and communicate with and instruct relevant crew with regard to the presence of protected species and mitigation requirements;


(2) All PSOs and PAM operators must have successfully attained a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university with a major in one of the natural sciences, a minimum of 30 semester hours or equivalent in the biological sciences, and at least one undergraduate course in math or statistics. The educational requirements may be waived if the PSO or PAM operator has acquired the relevant skills through a suitable amount of alternate experience. Requests for such a waiver must be submitted to NMFS Office of Protected Resources and must include written justification containing alternative experience. Alternate experience that may be considered includes, but is not limited to: previous work experience conducting academic, commercial, or government-sponsored marine mammal visual and/or acoustic surveys; or previous work experience as a PSO/PAM operator;


(3) PSOs must have visual acuity in both eyes (with correction of vision being permissible) sufficient enough to discern moving targets on the water's surface with the ability to estimate the target size and distance (binocular use is allowable); ability to conduct field observations and collect data according to the assigned protocols; sufficient training, orientation, or experience with the construction operation to provide for personal safety during observations; writing skills sufficient to document observations, including but not limited to, the number and species of marine mammals observed, the dates and times of when in-water construction activities were conducted, the dates and time when in-water construction activities were suspended to avoid potential incidental take of marine mammals from construction noise within a defined shutdown zone, and marine mammal behavior; and the ability to communicate orally, by radio, or in-person, with project personnel to provide real-time information on marine mammals observed in the area;


(4) All PSOs must be trained in northwestern Atlantic Ocean marine mammal identification and behaviors and must be able to conduct field observations and collect data according to assigned protocols.

(6) PSOs and PAM operators are responsible for obtaining NMFS' approval. NMFS may approve PSOs and PAM operators as conditional or unconditional. A conditionally-approved PSO or PAM operator may be one who has completed training in the last 5 years but has not yet attained the requisite field experience. An unconditionally approved PSO or PAM operator is one who has completed training within the last 5 years and attained the necessary experience (*i.e.,* demonstrate experience with monitoring for marine mammals at clearance and shutdown zone sizes similar to those produced during the respective activity). Lead PSO or PAM operators must be unconditionally approved and have a minimum of 90 days in an northwestern Atlantic Ocean offshore environment performing the role (either visual or acoustic), with the conclusion of the most recent relevant experience not more than 18 months previous. A conditionally approved PSO or PAM operator must be paired with an unconditionally approved PSO or PAM operator;


(7) PSOs for cable landfall construction (*i.e.,* vibratory pile installation and removal) and HRG surveys may be unconditionally or conditionally approved. PSOs and PAM operators for foundation installation and UXO/MEC activities must be unconditionally approved;


(8) At least one on-duty PSO and PAM operator, where applicable, for each activity (*e.g.,* impact pile driving, vibratory pile driving, UXO/MEC detonation activities, and HRG surveys) must be designated as the Lead PSO or Lead PAM operator;


(9) LOA Holder must submit NMFS previously approved PSOs and PAM operators to NMFS Office of Protected Resources for review and confirmation of their approval for specific roles at least 30 days prior to commencement of the activities requiring PSOs/PAM operators or 15 days prior to when new PSOs/PAM operators are required after activities have commenced;


(10) For prospective PSOs and PAM operators not previously approved, or for PSOs and PAM operators whose approval is not current, LOA Holder must submit resumes for approval at least 60 days prior to PSO and PAM operator use. Resumes must include information related to relevant education, experience, and training, including dates, duration, location, and description of prior PSO or PAM operator experience. Resumes must be accompanied by relevant documentation of successful completion of necessary training;


(11) PAM operators are responsible for obtaining NMFS approval. To be approved as a PAM operator, the person must meet the following qualifications: The PAM operator must demonstrate that they have prior experience with real-time acoustic detection systems and/or have completed specialized training for operating PAM systems and detecting and identifying Atlantic Ocean marine mammals sounds, in particular: North Atlantic right whale sounds, humpback whale sounds, and how to deconflict them from similar North Atlantic right whale sounds, and other co-occurring species' sounds in the area including sperm whales; must be able to distinguish between whether a marine mammal or other species sound is detected, possibly detected, not detected and similar terminology must be used across companies/projects; where localization of sounds or deriving bearings and distance are possible, the PAM operators need to have demonstrated experience in using this technique; PAM operators must be independent observers (*i.e.,* not construction personnel); PAM operators must demonstrate experience with relevant acoustic software and equipment; PAM operators must have the qualifications and relevant experience/training to safely deploy and retrieve equipment and program the software, as necessary; PAM operators must be able to test software and hardware functionality prior to operation; and PAM operators must have evaluated their acoustic detection software using the PAM Atlantic baleen whale annotated data set available at National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and provide evaluation/performance metric;


(12) PAM operators must be able to review and classify acoustic detections in real-time (prioritizing North Atlantic right whales and noting detection of other cetaceans) during the real-time monitoring periods;


(13) PSOs may work as PAM operators and vice versa, pending NMFS-approval; however, they may only perform one role at any one time and must not exceed work time restrictions, which must be tallied cumulatively; and


(14) All PSOs and PAM operators must complete a Permits and Environmental Compliance Plan training and a 2-day refresher session that must be held with the PSO provider and Project compliance representative(s) prior to the start of in-water project activities (*e.g.,* HRG survey, foundation installation, cable landfall activities, UXO/MEC detonations, *etc.*).


(b) *General PSO and PAM operator requirements.* The following measures apply to PSOs and PAM operators and must be implemented by LOA Holder:


(1) PSOs must monitor for marine mammals prior to, during, and following impact pile driving, vibratory pile driving, UXO/MEC detonation activities, and HRG surveys that use sub-bottom profilers (with specific monitoring durations and needs described in paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section, respectively). Monitoring must be done while free from distractions and in a consistent, systematic, and diligent manner;


(2) For foundation installation and UXO/MEC detonation, PSOs must visually clear (*i.e.,* confirm no observations of marine mammals) the entire minimum visibility zone for a full 30 minutes immediately prior to commencing activities. For cable landfall activities (*e.g.,* cofferdams and goal posts) and HRG surveys, which do not have a minimum visibility zone, the entire clearance zone must be visually cleared and as much of the Level B harassment zone as possible;


(3) All PSOs must be located at the best vantage point(s) on any platform, as determined by the Lead PSO, in order to obtain 360-degree visual coverage of the entire clearance and shutdown zones around the activity area, and as much of the Level B harassment zone as possible. PAM operators may be located on a vessel or remotely on-shore, the PAM operator(s) must assist PSOs in ensuring full coverage of the clearance and shutdown zones. The PAM operator must monitor to and past the clearance zone for large whales;


(4) All on-duty PSOs must remain in real-time contact with the on-duty PAM operator(s), PAM operators must immediately communicate all acoustic detections of marine mammals to PSOs, including any determination regarding species identification, distance, and bearing (where relevant) relative to the pile being driven and the degree of confidence (*e.g.,* possible, probable detection) in the determination. All on-duty PSOs and PAM operator(s) must remain in contact with the on-duty construction personnel responsible for implementing mitigations (*e.g.,* delay to pile driving or UXO/MEC detonation) to ensure communication on marine mammal observations can easily, quickly, and consistently occur between all on-duty PSOs, PAM operator(s), and on-water Project personnel;


(5) The PAM operator must inform the Lead PSO(s) on duty of animal detections approaching or within applicable ranges of interest to the activity occurring via the data collection software system (*i.e.,* Mysticetus or similar system) who must be responsible for requesting that the designated crewmember implement the necessary mitigation procedures (*i.e.,* delay);

During foundation installation and UXO/MEC detonations, at least two PSOs on the pile driving and detonation-dedicated PSO vessel must be equipped with functional Big Eye binoculars (*e.g.,* 25 x 150; 2.7 view angle; individual ocular focus; height control); these must be pedestal mounted on the deck at the best vantage point that provides for optimal sea surface observation and PSO safety. PAM operators must have the appropriate equipment (*i.e.,* a computer station equipped with a data collection software system available wherever they are stationed) and use a NMFS-approved PAM system to conduct monitoring. PAM systems are approved through the PAM Plan as described in ยง 217.264(c)(17);


(7) During periods of low visibility (*e.g.,* darkness, rain, fog, poor weather conditions, *etc.*), PSOs must use alternative technology (*i.e.,* infrared or thermal cameras) to monitor the clearance and shutdown zones as approved by NMFS; and


(8) PSOs and PAM operators must not exceed 4 consecutive watch hours on duty at any time, must have a 2-hour (minimum) break between watches, and must not exceed a combined watch schedule of more than 12 hours in a 24-hour period. If the schedule includes PSOs and PAM operators on-duty for 2-hour shifts, a minimum 1-hour break between watches must be allowed.


(c) *PSO and PAM operator requirements during WTG and OSS foundation installation and UXO/MEC detonations.* The following measures apply to PSOs and PAM operators during WTG and OSS foundation installation and UXO/MEC detonations and must be implemented by LOA Holder:


(1) PSOs and PAM operator(s), using a NMFS-approved PAM system, must monitor for marine mammals 60 minutes prior to, during, and 30 minutes following all pile-driving and UXO/MEC detonation activities. If PSOs cannot visually monitor the minimum visibility zone prior to impact pile driving or the clearance zone prior to any UXO/MEC detonation at all times using the equipment described in paragraphs (b)(6) and (7) of this section, pile-driving operations or UXO/MEC detonation must not commence or must shutdown if they are currently active;


(2) At least three on-duty PSOs must be stationed and observing from the activity platform during impact pile driving or UXO/MEC detonation and at least three on-duty PSOs must be stationed on each dedicated PSO vessel. If an aerial platform is required or used (per ยง 217.264(e)(7)), at least two on-duty PSOs must be actively searching for marine mammals. Concurrently, at least one PAM operator per acoustic data stream (equivalent to the number of acoustic buoys) must be actively monitoring for marine mammals 60 minutes before, during, and 30 minutes after impact pile driving or UXO/MEC detonation in accordance with a NMFS-approved PAM Plan;


(3) LOA Holder must conduct PAM for at least 24 hours immediately prior to pile driving or UXO/MEC detonation activities. The PAM operator must review all detections from the previous 24-hour period immediately prior to pile driving and UXO/MEC detonation activities.
