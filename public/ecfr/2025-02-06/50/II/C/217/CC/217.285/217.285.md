(a) *Protected species observer (PSO) and passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) operator qualifications.* LOA Holder must implement the following measures applicable to PSOs and PAM operators:


(1) LOA Holder must use independent, NMFS-approved PSOs and PAM operators, meaning that the PSOs and PAM operators must be employed by a third-party observer provider, must have no tasks other than to conduct observational effort, collect data, and communicate with and instruct relevant crew with regard to the presence of protected species and mitigation requirements;


(2) All PSOs and PAM operators must have successfully attained a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university with a major in one of the natural sciences, a minimum of 30 semester hours or equivalent in the biological sciences, and at least one undergraduate course in math or statistics. The educational requirements may be waived if the PSO or PAM operator has acquired the relevant skills through a suitable amount of alternate experience. Requests for such a waiver must be submitted to NMFS Office of Protected Resources and must include written justification containing alternative experience. Alternative experience that may be considered includes, but is not limited to: previous work experience conducting academic, commercial, or government-sponsored marine mammal visual and/or acoustic surveys; or previous work experience as a PSO/PAM operator. All PSOs and PAM operators should demonstrate good standing and consistently good performance of all assigned duties;


(3) PSOs must have visual acuity in both eyes (with correction of vision being permissible) sufficient enough to discern moving targets on the water's surface with the ability to estimate the target size and distance (binocular use is allowable); ability to conduct field observations and collect data according to the assigned protocols; sufficient training, orientation, or experience with the construction operation to provide for personal safety during observations; writing skills sufficient to document observations, including but not limited to, the number and species of marine mammals observed, the dates and times of when in-water construction activities were conducted, the dates and time when in-water construction activities were suspended to avoid potential incidental take of marine mammals from construction noise within a defined shutdown zone, and marine mammal behavior; and the ability to communicate orally, by radio, or in-person, with project personnel to provide real-time information on marine mammals observed in the area;


(4) All PSOs must be trained in northwestern Atlantic Ocean marine mammal identification and behaviors and must be able to conduct field observations and collect data according to assigned protocols.

(5) All PSOs and PAM operators must successfully complete a relevant training course within the last 5 years, including obtaining a certificate of course completion;


(6) PSOs and PAM operators are responsible for obtaining NMFS' approval. NMFS may approve PSOs and PAM operators as conditional or unconditional. A conditionally-approved PSO or PAM operator may be one who has completed training in the last 5 years but has not yet attained the requisite field experience. An unconditionally approved PSO or PAM operator is one who has completed training within the last 5 years and attained the necessary experience (*i.e.,* demonstrate experience with monitoring for marine mammals at clearance and shutdown zone sizes similar to those produced during the respective activity). Lead PSO or PAM operators must be unconditionally approved and have a minimum of 90 days in a northwestern Atlantic Ocean offshore environment performing the role (either visual or acoustic), with the conclusion of the most recent relevant experience not more than 18 months previous. A conditionally approved PSO or PAM operator must be paired with an unconditionally approved PSO or PAM operator;

(8) At least one on-duty PSO and PAM operator, where applicable, for each activity (*e.g.,* impact pile driving, vibratory pile driving, and HRG surveys) must be designated as the Lead PSO or Lead PAM operator. The Lead PSO should be unconditionally approved for Tiers 1-3;


(9) LOA Holder must submit NMFS previously approved PSO and PAM operator resumes to NMFS Office of Protected Resources for review and confirmation of their approval for specific roles at least 30 days prior to commencement of the activities requiring PSOs/PAM operators or 15 days prior to when new PSOs/PAM operators are required after activities have commenced;


(10) For prospective PSOs and PAM operators not previously approved, or for PSOs and PAM operators whose approval is not current, LOA Holder must submit resumes for approval at least 60 days prior to PSO and PAM operator use. Resumes must include information related to relevant education, experience, and training, including dates, duration, location, and description of prior PSO or PAM operator experience. Resumes must be accompanied by relevant documentation of successful completion of necessary training and include which specific roles and activities the PSOs/PAM operators are being requested for. PAM operator experience must also include the information described in paragraph (a)(11) of this section;


(11) PAM operators are responsible for obtaining NMFS' approval. To be approved as a PAM operator, the person must meet the following qualifications: The PAM operator must demonstrate that they have prior large whale PAM experience with real-time acoustic detection systems and/or have completed specialized training for the PAM system(s) that will be used for the Project; PAM operators must demonstrate they are able to detect and identify Atlantic Ocean marine mammals sounds, in particular: North Atlantic right whale sounds, humpback whale sounds, and that they are able to deconflict humpback whale sounds from similar North Atlantic right whale sounds, and other co-occurring species' sounds in the area including sperm whales; must be able to distinguish between whether a marine mammal or other species sound is detected, possibly detected, or not detected; where localization of sounds or deriving bearings and distance are possible, the PAM operators need to have demonstrated experience in the localization of sounds or deriving bearings and distance; PAM operators must be independent observers (*i.e.,* not construction personnel); PAM operators must demonstrate experience with relevant acoustic software and equipment; PAM operators must have the qualifications and relevant experience/training to safely deploy and retrieve equipment and program the software, as necessary; PAM operators must be able to test software and hardware functionality prior to operation; and PAM operators must have evaluated their acoustic detection software using the PAM Atlantic baleen whale annotated data set available at National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and provide evaluation/performance metrics;

(b) *General PSO and PAM operator requirements.* The following measures apply to PSOs and PAM operators and must be implemented by LOA Holder:


(1) All PSOs must be located at the best vantage point(s) on any platform, as determined by the Lead PSO, in order to obtain 360-degree visual coverage of the entire clearance and shutdown zones around the activity area, and as much of the Level B harassment zone as possible. PAM operators may be located on a vessel or remotely on-shore. The PAM operator(s) must assist PSOs in ensuring full coverage of the clearance and shutdown zones. The PAM operator must monitor to and past the clearance zone for large whales;


(2) All on-duty PSOs must remain in real-time contact with the on-duty PAM operator(s), PAM operators must immediately communicate all acoustic detections of marine mammals to PSOs, including any determination regarding species identification, distance, and bearing (where relevant) relative to the pile being driven and the degree of confidence (*e.g.,* detected, possibly detected, not detected) in the determination. All on-duty PSOs and PAM operator(s) must remain in real-time contact with the on-duty construction personnel responsible for implementing mitigations (*e.g.,* delay to pile driving) to ensure communication on marine mammal observations can easily, quickly, and consistently occur between all on-duty PSOs, PAM operator(s), and on-water Project personnel;


(3) The PAM operator must inform the Lead PSO(s) on duty of animal detections approaching or within applicable ranges of interest to the activity occurring via the data collection software system (*i.e.,* Mysticetus or similar system) who must be responsible for requesting that the designated crewmember implement the necessary mitigation procedures (*i.e.,* delay);


(4) PSOs must use high magnification (25x) binoculars, standard handheld (7x) binoculars, and the naked eye to search continuously for marine mammals. During foundation installation, at least three PSOs on the pile driving and any dedicated PSO vessel that may be used must be equipped with functional Big Eye binoculars (*e.g.,* 25 x 150; 2.7 view angle; individual ocular focus; height control). These must be pedestal mounted on the deck at the best vantage point that provides for optimal sea surface observation and PSO safety. A minimum of 3 PSOs must be active on a dedicated PSO vessel or an alternate monitoring technology (*e.g.,* UAS) must be used that has been demonstrated as having greater visual monitoring capability compared to 3 PSOs on a dedicated PSO vessel and is approved by NMFS. PAM operators must have the appropriate equipment (*i.e.,* a computer station equipped with a data collection software system available wherever they are stationed) and use a NMFS-approved PAM system to conduct monitoring. PAM systems are approved through the PAM Plan as described in § 217.284(c)(15);


(5) During periods of low visibility (*e.g.,* darkness, rain, fog, poor weather conditions, *etc.*), PSOs must use alternative technology (*i.e.,* infrared or thermal cameras) to monitor the clearance and shutdown zones as approved by NMFS;


(6) PSOs and PAM operators must not exceed 4 consecutive watch hours on duty at any time, must have a 2-hour (minimum) break between watches, and must not exceed a combined watch schedule of more than 12 hours in a 24-hour period;


(7) Any PSO has the authority to call for a delay or shutdown of project activities;


(8) Any visual observations of ESA-listed marine mammals must be communicated immediately to PSOs and vessel captains associated with other vessels to increase situational awareness; and


(9) LOA Holder personnel and PSOs are required to use available sources of information on North Atlantic right whale presence to aid in monitoring efforts. These include daily monitoring of the Right Whale Sightings Advisory System, consulting of the WhaleAlert app, and monitoring of the Coast Guard's VHF Channel 16 throughout the day to receive notifications of any sightings and information associated with any Dynamic Management Areas, to plan construction activities and vessel routes, if practicable, to minimize the potential for co-occurrence with North Atlantic right whales.


(c) *PSO and PAM operator requirements during WTG and OSS foundation installation.* The following measures apply to PSOs and PAM operators during WTG and OSS foundation installation and must be implemented by LOA Holder:


(1) PSOs and PAM operator(s), using a NMFS-approved PAM system, must monitor for marine mammals 60 minutes prior to, during, and 30 minutes following all pile-driving activities. If PSOs cannot visually monitor the minimum visibility zone prior to foundation pile driving at all times using the equipment described in paragraphs (b)(4) and (5) of this section, pile-driving operations must not commence or must shutdown if they are currently active. Foundation pile driving may only commence when the minimum visibility zone is fully visible (*e.g.,* not obscured by darkness, rain, fog, etc.) and the clearance zones are clear of marine mammals for at least 30 minutes, as determined by the Lead PSO, immediately prior to the initiation of impact pile driving;


(2) At least three on-duty PSOs must be stationed on each vessel-based observer platform. If an aerial platform is used (per § 217.284(e)(7)), at least two on-duty PSOs must be actively searching for marine mammals. Concurrently, at least one PAM operator per acoustic data stream (*i.e.,* equivalent to the number of acoustic buoys) must be actively monitoring for marine mammals 60 minutes before and during, and 30 minutes after impact pile driving in accordance with a NMFS-approved PAM Plan; and


(3) LOA Holder must conduct PAM for at least 24 hours immediately prior to pile driving activities. The PAM operator must review all detections from the previous 24-hour period immediately prior to pile driving activities.

The report must include: the time, date, and location of the incident; species identification (if known) or description of the animal(s) involved; vessel size and motor configuration (*e.g.,* inboard, outboard, jet propulsion); vessel's speed leading up to and during the incident; vessel's course/heading and what operations were being conducted (if applicable); status of all sound sources in use; description of avoidance measures/requirements that were in place at the time of the strike and what additional measures were taken, if any, to avoid strike; environmental conditions (*e.g.,* wind speed and direction, Beaufort sea state, cloud cover, visibility) immediately preceding the strike; estimated size and length of animal that was struck; description of the behavior of the marine mammal immediately preceding and following the strike; if available, description of the presence and behavior of any other marine mammals immediately preceding the strike; estimated fate of the animal (*e.g.,* dead, injured but alive, injured and moving, blood or tissue observed in the water, status unknown, disappeared); and, to the extent practicable, photographs or video footage of the animal(s). LOA Holder must immediately cease all on-water activities until the NMFS Office of Protected Resources is able to review the circumstances of the incident and determine what, if any, additional measures are appropriate to ensure compliance with the terms of the LOA. NMFS Office of Protected Resources may impose additional measures to minimize the likelihood of further prohibited take and ensure MMPA compliance. LOA Holder may not resume their activities until notified by NMFS Office of Protected Resources; and


(16) LOA Holder must report any lost gear associated with the fishery surveys to the NMFS GARFO Protected Resources Division (*nmfs.gar.incidental-take@noaa.gov*) as soon as possible or within 24 hours of the documented time of missing or lost gear. This report must include information on any markings on the gear and any efforts undertaken or planned to recover the gear.
