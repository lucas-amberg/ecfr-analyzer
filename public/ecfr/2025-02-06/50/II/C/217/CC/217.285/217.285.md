The PAM operator must monitor to and past the clearance zone for large whales;


(2) All on-duty PSOs must remain in real-time contact with the on-duty PAM operator(s), PAM operators must immediately communicate all acoustic detections of marine mammals to PSOs, including any determination regarding species identification, distance, and bearing (where relevant) relative to the pile being driven and the degree of confidence (*e.g.,* detected, possibly detected, not detected) in the determination. All on-duty PSOs and PAM operator(s) must remain in real-time contact with the on-duty construction personnel responsible for implementing mitigations (*e.g.,* delay to pile driving) to ensure communication on marine mammal observations can easily, quickly, and consistently occur between all on-duty PSOs, PAM operator(s), and on-water Project personnel;


(3) The PAM operator must inform the Lead PSO(s) on duty of animal detections approaching or within applicable ranges of interest to the activity occurring via the data collection software system (*i.e.,* Mysticetus or similar system) who must be responsible for requesting that the designated crewmember implement the necessary mitigation procedures (*i.e.,* delay);

PAM operators must have the appropriate equipment (*i.e.,* a computer station equipped with a data collection software system available wherever they are stationed) and use a NMFS-approved PAM system to conduct monitoring. PAM systems are approved through the PAM Plan as described in ยง 217.284(c)(15);


(5) During periods of low visibility (*e.g.,* darkness, rain, fog, poor weather conditions, *etc.*), PSOs must use alternative technology (*i.e.,* infrared or thermal cameras) to monitor the clearance and shutdown zones as approved by NMFS;

(8) Any visual observations of ESA-listed marine mammals must be communicated immediately to PSOs and vessel captains associated with other vessels to increase situational awareness; and


(9) LOA Holder personnel and PSOs are required to use available sources of information on North Atlantic right whale presence to aid in monitoring efforts. These include daily monitoring of the Right Whale Sightings Advisory System, consulting of the WhaleAlert app, and monitoring of the Coast Guard's VHF Channel 16 throughout the day to receive notifications of any sightings and information associated with any Dynamic Management Areas, to plan construction activities and vessel routes, if practicable, to minimize the potential for co-occurrence with North Atlantic right whales.


(c) *PSO and PAM operator requirements during WTG and OSS foundation installation.* The following measures apply to PSOs and PAM operators during WTG and OSS foundation installation and must be implemented by LOA Holder:


(1) PSOs and PAM operator(s), using a NMFS-approved PAM system, must monitor for marine mammals 60 minutes prior to, during, and 30 minutes following all pile-driving activities. If PSOs cannot visually monitor the minimum visibility zone prior to foundation pile driving at all times using the equipment described in paragraphs (b)(4) and (5) of this section, pile-driving operations must not commence or must shutdown if they are currently active. Foundation pile driving may only commence when the minimum visibility zone is fully visible (*e.g.,* not obscured by darkness, rain, fog, etc.) and the clearance zones are clear of marine mammals for at least 30 minutes, as determined by the Lead PSO, immediately prior to the initiation of impact pile driving;


(2) At least three on-duty PSOs must be stationed on each vessel-based observer platform. If an aerial platform is used (per ยง 217.284(e)(7)), at least two on-duty PSOs must be actively searching for marine mammals.

The report must include: the time, date, and location of the incident; species identification (if known) or description of the animal(s) involved; vessel size and motor configuration (*e.g.,* inboard, outboard, jet propulsion); vessel's speed leading up to and during the incident; vessel's course/heading and what operations were being conducted (if applicable); status of all sound sources in use; description of avoidance measures/requirements that were in place at the time of the strike and what additional measures were taken, if any, to avoid strike; environmental conditions (*e.g.,* wind speed and direction, Beaufort sea state, cloud cover, visibility) immediately preceding the strike; estimated size and length of animal that was struck; description of the behavior of the marine mammal immediately preceding and following the strike; if available, description of the presence and behavior of any other marine mammals immediately preceding the strike; estimated fate of the animal (*e.g.,* dead, injured but alive, injured and moving, blood or tissue observed in the water, status unknown, disappeared); and, to the extent practicable, photographs or video footage of the animal(s). LOA Holder must immediately cease all on-water activities until the NMFS Office of Protected Resources is able to review the circumstances of the incident and determine what, if any, additional measures are appropriate to ensure compliance with the terms of the LOA. NMFS Office of Protected Resources may impose additional measures to minimize the likelihood of further prohibited take and ensure MMPA compliance. LOA Holder may not resume their activities until notified by NMFS Office of Protected Resources; and


(16) LOA Holder must report any lost gear associated with the fishery surveys to the NMFS GARFO Protected Resources Division (*nmfs.gar.incidental-take@noaa.gov*) as soon as possible or within 24 hours of the documented time of missing or lost gear. This report must include information on any markings on the gear and any efforts undertaken or planned to recover the gear.
