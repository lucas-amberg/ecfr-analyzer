# § 217.294   Mitigation requirements.

When conducting the activities identified in § 217.290(c) within the area described in § 217.290(b), LOA Holder must implement the mitigation measures contained in this section and any LOA issued under §§ 217.296 or 217.297. These mitigation measures include, but are not limited to:


(a) *General conditions.* LOA Holder must comply with the following general measures:


(1) A copy of any issued LOA must be in the possession of LOA Holder and its designees, all vessel operators, visual protected species observers (PSOs), passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) operators, pile driver operators, and any other relevant designees operating under the authority of the issued LOA;


(2) LOA Holder must conduct training for construction, survey, and vessel personnel and the marine mammal monitoring team (PSO and PAM operators) prior to the start of all in-water construction activities in order to explain responsibilities, communication procedures, marine mammal detection and identification, mitigation, monitoring, and reporting requirements, safety and operational procedures, and authorities of the marine mammal monitoring team(s). This training must be repeated for new personnel who join the work during the project. A description of the training program must be provided to NMFS at least 60 days prior to the initial training before in-water activities begin. Confirmation of all required training must be documented on a training course log sheet and reported to NMFS Office of Protected Resources prior to initiating project activities;


(3) Prior to and when conducting any in-water construction activities and vessel operations, LOA Holder personnel and contractors (*e.g.,* vessel operators, PSOs) must use available sources of information on North Atlantic right whale presence in or near the Project Area including daily monitoring of the Right Whale Sightings Advisory System, and monitoring of U.S. Coast Guard VHF Channel 16 throughout the day to receive notification of any sightings and/or information associated with any Slow Zones (*i.e.,* DMAs and/or acoustically-triggered slow zones) to provide situational awareness for both vessel operators, PSO(s), and PAM operator(s). The marine mammal monitoring team must monitor these systems no less than every 4 hours;


(4) Any marine mammal observed by project personnel must be immediately communicated to any on-duty PSOs, PAM operator(s), and all vessel captains. Any large whale observation or acoustic detection by PSOs or PAM operators must be conveyed to all vessel captains;


(5) For North Atlantic right whales, any visual detection by a PSO or acoustic detection by PAM operators at any distance (where applicable for the specified activities) must trigger a delay to the commencement of pile driving and HRG surveys;


(6) In the event that a large whale is sighted or acoustically detected that cannot be confirmed as a non-North Atlantic right whale, it must be treated as if it were a North Atlantic right whale for purposes of mitigation;


(7) Any PSO has the authority to call for a delay or shutdown of project activities. If a delay to commencing an activity is called for by a PSO, LOA Holder must take the required mitigative action. If a shutdown of an activity is called for by a PSO, LOA Holder must take the required mitigative action unless shutdown would result in imminent risk of injury or loss of life to an individual, pile refusal, or pile instability. Any disagreements between the Lead PSO and the activity operator or between the Lead PSO and another PSO regarding delays or shutdowns must only be discussed after the mitigative action has occurred;


(8) Any marine mammals observed within a clearance or shutdown zone must be allowed to remain in the area (*i.e.,* must leave of their own volition) prior to commencing pile driving activities or HRG surveys;


(9) If an individual from a species for which authorization has not been granted, or a species for which authorization has been granted but the authorized take number has been met, is observed entering or within the relevant clearance zone prior to beginning a specified activity, the activity must be delayed. If an activity is ongoing and individual from a species for which authorization has not been granted, or a species for which authorization has been granted but the authorized take number has been met, is observed entering or within the relevant shutdown zone, the activity must be shut down (*i.e.,* cease) immediately, unless shutdown would result in imminent risk of injury or loss of life to an individual, pile refusal, or pile instability. The activity must not commence or resume until the animal(s) has been confirmed to have left the clearance or shutdown zones and is on a path away from the applicable zone or after 15 minutes with no further sightings for small odontocetes and pinnipeds or 30 minutes with no further sightings for all other species;


(10) For in-water construction heavy machinery activities listed in § 217.290(c), if a marine mammal is on a path towards or comes within 10 meters (m; 32.8 feet (ft)) of equipment, LOA Holder must cease operations until the marine mammal has moved more than 10 m on a path away from the activity to avoid direct interaction with equipment;


(11) All vessels must be equipped with a properly installed, operational Automatic Identification System (AIS) device and LOA Holder must report all Maritime Mobile Service Identify (MMSI) numbers to NMFS Office of Protected Resources;


(12) By accepting the LOA, LOA Holder consents to on-site observation and inspections by Federal agency personnel (including NOAA personnel) during activities described in this subpart, for the purposes of evaluating the implementation and effectiveness of measures contained within the LOA and this subpart; and


(13) It is prohibited to assault, harm, harass (including sexually harass), oppose, impede, intimidate, impair, or in any way influence or interfere with a PSO, PAM Operator, or vessel crew member acting as an observer, or attempt the same. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, any action that interferes with an observer's responsibilities, or that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment. Personnel may report any violations to the NMFS Office of Law Enforcement.


(b) *Vessel strike avoidance measures.* LOA Holder must comply with the following vessel strike avoidance measures while in the specified geographic region, unless an emergency situation presents a threat to the health, safety, or life of a person, or when a vessel is actively engaged in emergency rescue or response duties, including vessel-in-distress or environmental crisis response, and requires speeds in excess of 10 kn (11.5 miles per hour (mph)) to fulfill those responsibilities. An emergency is defined as a serious event that occurs without warning and requires immediate action to avert, control, or remedy harm. Speed over ground will be used to measure all vessel speeds:


(1) Prior to the start of the Project's activities involving vessels, all vessel personnel must receive a protected species training that covers, at a minimum, identification of marine mammals that have the potential to occur where vessels would be operating; detection and observation methods in both good weather conditions (*i.e.,* clear visibility, low winds, low sea states) and bad weather conditions (*i.e.,* fog, high winds, high sea states, with glare); sighting communication protocols; all vessel speed and approach limit mitigation requirements (*e.g.,* vessel strike avoidance measures); and information and resources available to the project personnel regarding the applicability of Federal laws and regulations for protected species. This training must be repeated for any new vessel personnel who join the Project. Confirmation of the vessel personnel's training and understanding of the Incidental Take Authorization (ITA) requirements must be documented on a training course log sheet and reported to NMFS within 30 days of completion of training;


(2) All vessel operators, operating at any speed and regardless of their vessel's size, must slow down, stop their vessel, or alter course to avoid striking any marine mammal;


(3) All vessels, regardless of their size, operating at any speed must have a dedicated visual observer aboard and on duty at all times whose sole responsibility (*i.e.,* must not have duties other than observing) is to monitor for marine mammals within a 180° direction of the forward path of the vessel (90° port to 90° starboard) located at an appropriate vantage point for ensuring vessels are maintaining appropriate separation distances. Visual observers must be equipped with alternative monitoring technology (*e.g.,* night vision devices, infrared cameras) for periods of low visibility (*e.g.,* darkness, rain, fog, *etc.*). The dedicated visual observer must receive prior training on protected species detection and identification, vessel strike minimization procedures, how and when to communicate with the vessel captain, and reporting requirements in this subpart. These visual observers may be third-party observers (*i.e.,* NMFS-approved PSOs; *see* § 217.295(a)) or trained crew members (*see* (b)(1) of this section);


(4) At the onset of transiting and continuously thereafter, vessel operators must monitor the U.S. Coast Guard VHF Channel 16, over which North Atlantic right whale sightings are broadcasted. At the onset of transiting and at least once every 4 hours, vessel operators and/or trained crew member(s) must also monitor the project's Situational Awareness System (if applicable), WhaleAlert, and relevant NOAA information systems such as the Right Whale Sighting Advisory System (RWSAS) for the presence of North Atlantic right whales;


(5) Any large whale sighting by any project-personnel, including any LOA Holder staff, contractors, or vessel crew, must be immediately communicated to all project-associated vessel operators, PSOs, and PAM operators for situational awareness. Conversely, any large whale observation or detection via a sighting network (*e.g.,* Mysticetus or similar software) by PSOs or PAM operators must be conveyed to vessel operators and crew. An ongoing large whale sighting log sheet must be maintained on each vessel and retained for vessel operator(s) review each day prior to first day's transit for awareness of recent sightings;


(6) All vessel operators must abide by existing applicable vessel speed regulations (*see* 50 CFR 224.105). Nothing in this subpart exempts vessels from any other applicable marine mammal speed or approach regulations. Vessels must not travel over 10 kn from November 1st through April 30th, annually, in the specified geographic region, and must transit at 10 kn or less within any active North Atlantic right whale Slow Zone (*i.e.,* Dynamic Management Areas (DMAs) or acoustically-triggered slow zone);


(7) All vessel operators, regardless of their vessel's size, must immediately reduce vessel speed to 10 kn or less for at least 24 hours when a North Atlantic right whale is sighted at any distance by any project-related personnel or acoustically detected by any project-related PAM system. Each subsequent observation or acoustic detection in the Project area shall trigger an additional 24-hour period. If a North Atlantic right whale is reported by project personnel or via any of the monitoring systems (refer back to paragraph (b)(4) of this section) that vessel must operate at 10 kn (11.5 mph) or less for 24 hours following the reported detection;


(8) All vessels, regardless of size, must immediately reduce speed to 10 kn or less when any large whale, mother/calf pairs, or large assemblages of cetaceans are observed within 500 m (0.31 mi) of an underway vessel;


(9) If vessel(s) are traveling at speeds greater than 10 kn (*i.e.,* no speed restrictions are enacted) in the transit corridor (defined as from a port to the Lease Area or return), in addition to the required dedicated visual observer, LOA Holder must monitor the transit corridor in real-time with PAM prior to and during transits. If a North Atlantic right whale is detected via visual observation or PAM detection within or approaching the transit corridor, all vessels in the transit corridor must travel at 10 kn or less for 24 hours following the detection. Each subsequent detection shall trigger a 24-hour reset. A slowdown in the transit corridor expires when there has been no further visual or acoustic detection in the transit corridor in the past 24 hours;


(10) All vessels must maintain a minimum separation distance of 500 m from North Atlantic right whales. If underway, all vessels must steer a course away from any sighted North Atlantic right whale at 10 kn or less such that the 500-m minimum separation distance requirement is not violated. If a North Atlantic right whale is sighted within 500 m of an underway vessel, that vessel operator must reduce speed and shift the engine to neutral. Engines must not be engaged until the whale has moved outside of the vessel's path and beyond 500 m. If a whale is observed but cannot be confirmed as a species other than a North Atlantic right whale, the vessel operator must assume that it is a North Atlantic right whale and take the vessel strike avoidance measures described in this paragraph (b)(7) of this section;


(11) All vessels must maintain a minimum separation distance of 100 m (328 ft) from sperm whales and non-North Atlantic right whale baleen whales. If one of these species is sighted within 100 m of a transiting vessel, the vessel must shift the engine(s) to neutral. Engines must not be engaged until the whale has moved outside of the vessel's path and beyond 100 m;


(12) All vessels must maintain a minimum separation distance of 50 m (164 ft) from all delphinoid cetaceans and pinnipeds with an exception made for those that approach the vessel (*i.e.,* bow-riding dolphins). If a delphinid cetacean or pinniped is sighted within 50 m of a transiting vessel, the vessel must shift the engine to neutral, with an exception made for those that approach the vessel (*e.g.,* bow-riding dolphins). Engines must not be engaged until the animal(s) has moved outside of the vessel's path and beyond 50 m;


(13) When a marine mammal(s) is sighted while the vessel(s) is transiting, the vessel must take action as necessary to avoid violating the relevant separation distances (*e.g.,* attempt to remain parallel to the animal's course, slow down, and avoid abrupt changes in direction until the animal has left the area). This measure does not apply to any vessel towing gear or any situation where respecting the relevant separation distance would be unsafe (*i.e.,* any situation where the vessel is navigationally constrained);


(14) All vessels underway must not divert or alter course to approach any marine mammal;


(15) Vessel operators must check, daily, for information regarding the establishment of mandatory or voluntary vessel strike avoidance areas (*i.e.,* DMAs, Seasonal Management Areas, Slow Zones) and any information regarding North Atlantic right whale sighting locations; and


(16) LOA Holder must submit a North Atlantic Right Whale Vessel Strike Avoidance Plan to NMFS Office of Protected Resources for review and approval at least 180 days prior to the planned start of vessel activity. The plan must provide details on the vessel-based observer and PAM protocols for transiting vessels in the vessel transit corridor. If a plan is not submitted and approved by NMFS prior to vessel operations, all project vessels must travel at speeds of 10 kn (11.5 mph) or less. LOA Holder must comply with any approved North Atlantic Right Whale Vessel Strike Avoidance Plan.


(c) *WTG and OSS foundation installation.* The following requirements apply to pile driving activities associated with the installation of WTG and OSS foundations:


(1) Vibratory and impact pile driving of foundation piles must not occur November 1st through April 30th, annually;


(2) Monopiles must be no larger than 9.5-m in diameter, representing the larger end of the tapered 9.5/7.5-m monopile design. Pin piles must be no larger than 2.8-m in diameter. During all monopile and pin pile installation, the minimum amount of hammer energy necessary to effectively and safely install and maintain the integrity of the piles must be used. Hammer energies must not exceed 4,000 kilojoules (kJ) for monopile installations and 3,000 kJ for pin pile installation. No more than two monopile foundation or two pin piles for jacket foundations may be installed per day;


(3) LOA Holder may initiate foundation pile driving (*i.e.,* vibratory and impact) only from May 1st through October 31st, annually, in accordance with the NMFS-approved Pile Driving Plan;


(4) LOA Holder must only perform foundation pile driving during daylight hours, defined as no later than 1.5 hours prior to civil sunset and no earlier than 1 hour after civil sunrise, and may only continue into darkness if stopping operations represents a risk to human health, safety, and/or pile stability and an Alternative Monitoring Plan has been approved by NMFS. No new pile driving may begin when pile driving continues into darkness;


(5) LOA Holder must utilize a soft-start protocol at the beginning of foundation installation for each impact pile driving event. No soft-start for vibratory pile driving is necessary;


(6) Soft-start must occur at the beginning of impact driving and at any time following a cessation of impact pile driving of 30 minutes or longer;


(7) LOA Holder must establish clearance and shutdown zones, which must be measured using the radial distance around the pile being driven. Clearance monitoring must begin 60 minutes immediately prior to initiation of pile driving. If a marine mammal is detected within or about to enter the applicable clearance zones 30 minutes prior to the beginning of pile driving (including soft start if impact pile driving) or during pile driving, pile driving must be delayed or shutdown until the animal has been visually observed exiting the clearance zone or until a specific time period has elapsed with no further sightings. The specific time periods are 15 minutes for small odontocetes and pinnipeds, and 30 minutes for all other species;


(8) For North Atlantic right whales, any visual observation or acoustic detection must trigger a delay to the commencement of pile driving. The clearance zone may only be declared clear if no North Atlantic right whale acoustic or visual detections have occurred within the clearance zone during the 60-minute monitoring period;


(9) LOA Holder must deploy at least two functional noise abatement systems that reduce noise levels to the modeled harassment isopleths, assuming 10-dB attenuation, during all foundation pile driving:


(i) At least a double bubble curtain must be used;


(ii) Any bubble curtain(s) must distribute air bubbles using an air flow rate of at least 0.5 m
3/(minute*m). The bubble curtain(s) must surround 100 percent of the piling perimeter throughout the full depth of the water column. In the unforeseen event of a single compressor malfunction, the offshore personnel operating the bubble curtain(s) must adjust the air supply and operating pressure such that the maximum possible sound attenuation performance of the bubble curtain(s) is achieved;


(iii) The lowest bubble ring must be in contact with the seafloor for the full circumference of the ring, and the weights attached to the bottom ring must ensure 100-percent seafloor contact;


(iv) No parts of the ring or other objects may prevent full seafloor contact with a bubble curtain ring;


(v) Construction contractors must train personnel in the proper balancing of airflow to the bubble curtain ring. LOA Holder must provide NMFS Office of Protected Resources with a bubble curtain performance test and maintenance report to review within 72 hours after each pile using a bubble curtain is installed. Additionally, a full maintenance check (*e.g.,* manually clearing holes) must occur prior to each pile being installed;


(vi) Corrections to the bubble ring(s) to meet the performance standards in this paragraph (c)(9) must occur prior to pile driving of foundation piles.


(vii) For any noise mitigation device in addition to the bubble curtain, LOA Holder must inspect and carry out appropriate maintenance on the system and ensure the system is functioning properly prior to every pile driving event.


(10) LOA Holder must utilize NMFS-approved PAM systems, as described in paragraph (c)(17) of this section. The PAM system components (*i.e.,* acoustic buoys) must not be placed closer than 1 km (0.6 mi) to the pile being driven so that the activities do not mask the PAM system. LOA Holder must demonstrate and prove the detection range of the system they plan to deploy while considering potential masking from concurrent pile-driving and vessel noise. The PAM system must be able to detect a vocalization of North Atlantic right whales up to 10 km (6.2 mi);


(11) LOA Holder must utilize PSO(s) and PAM operator(s), as described in § 217.295(c). At least three on-duty PSOs must be on the pile driving platform. Additionally, two dedicated-PSO vessels must be used at least 60 minutes before, during, and 30 minutes after all pile driving, and each dedicated-PSO vessel must have at least three PSOs on duty during these time periods. LOA Holder may request NMFS approval to use alternative technology *in lieu* of one or two of the dedicated PSO vessels that provide similar marine mammal detection capabilities.


(12) If a marine mammal is detected (visually or acoustically) entering or within the respective shutdown zone after pile driving has begun, the PSO must call for a shutdown of pile driving and LOA Holder must stop pile driving immediately, unless shutdown is not practicable due to imminent risk of injury or loss of life to an individual or risk of damage to a vessel that creates risk of injury or loss of life for individuals, or the lead engineer determines there is risk of pile refusal or pile instability. If pile driving is not shut down due to one of these situations, LOA Holder must reduce hammer energy to the lowest level practicable and the reason(s) for not shutting down must be documented and reported to NMFS Office of Protected Resources within the applicable monitoring reports (*e.g.,* weekly, monthly) (*see* 217.295(g));


(13) A visual observation at any distance from a PSO or acoustic detection of a North Atlantic right whale triggers shutdown requirements under paragraph (c)(12) of this section. If pile driving has been shut down due to the presence of a North Atlantic right whale, pile driving may not restart until the North Atlantic right whale has neither been visually or acoustically detected for 30 minutes;


(14) If pile driving has been shut down due to the presence of a marine mammal other than a North Atlantic right whale, pile driving must not restart until either the marine mammal(s) has voluntarily left the specific clearance zones and has been visually or acoustically confirmed beyond that clearance zone, or, when specific time periods have elapsed with no further sightings or acoustic detections have occurred. The specific time periods are 15 minutes for small odontocetes and pinnipeds, and 30 minutes for all other marine mammal species. In cases where these criteria are not met, pile driving may restart only if necessary to maintain pile stability at which time LOA Holder must use the lowest hammer energy practicable to maintain stability;


(15) LOA Holder must conduct sound field verification (SFV) measurements during pile driving activities associated with the installation of, at minimum, the first three monopile foundations and for all three OSS foundations (for all 12 pin piles installed). SFV measurements must continue until at least three consecutive piles demonstrate noise levels are at or below those modeled, assuming 10 decibels (dB) of attenuation. Subsequent SFV measurements are also required should larger piles be installed or if additional monopiles are driven that may produce louder sound fields than those previously measured (*e.g.,* higher hammer energy, greater number of strikes, *etc.*). SFV measurements must be conducted as follows:


(i) Measurements must be made at a minimum of four distances from the pile(s) being driven, along a single transect, in the direction of lowest transmission loss (*i.e.,* projected lowest transmission loss coefficient), including, but not limited to, 750 m (2,460 ft) and three additional ranges, including, at least, the modeled Level B harassment isopleth assuming 10 dB attenuation. At least one additional measurement at an azimuth 90 degrees from the array at 750 m must be made. At each location, there must be a near bottom and mid-water column hydrophone;


(ii) The recordings must be continuous throughout the duration of all pile driving of each foundation;


(iii) The SFV measurement systems must have a sensitivity appropriate for the expected sound levels from pile driving received at the nominal ranges throughout the installation of the pile. The frequency range of SFV measurement systems must cover the range of at least 20 hertz (Hz) to 20 kilohertz (kHz). The SFV measurement systems must be designed to have omnidirectional sensitivity so that the broadband received level of all pile driving exceeds the system noise floor by at least 10 dB. The dynamic range of the SFV measurement system must be sufficient such that at each location, and the signals avoid poor signal-to-noise ratios for low amplitude signals and avoid clipping, nonlinearity, and saturation for high amplitude signals;


(iv) All hydrophones used in SFV measurements systems are required to have undergone a full system, traceable laboratory calibration conforming to International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 60565, or an equivalent standard procedure, from a factory or accredited source to ensure the hydrophone receives accurate sound levels, at a date not to exceed 2 years before deployment. Additional *in-situ* calibration checks using a pistonphone are required to be performed before and after each hydrophone deployment. If the measurement system employs filters via hardware or software (*e.g.,* high-pass, low-pass, *etc.*), which is not already accounted for by the calibration, the filter performance (*i.e.,* the filter's frequency response) must be known, reported, and the data corrected before analysis.


(v) LOA Holder must be prepared with additional equipment (hydrophones, recording devices, hydrophone calibrators, cables, batteries, *etc.*), which exceeds the amount of equipment necessary to perform the measurements, such that technical issues can be mitigated before measurement;


(vi) LOA Holder must submit interim reports within 48 hours after each foundation is measured (see § 217.295(g) section for interim and final reporting requirements);


(vii) LOA Holder must not exceed modeled distances to NMFS marine mammal Level A harassment and Level B harassment thresholds, assuming 10-dB attenuation, for foundation installation. If any of the interim SFV measurement reports submitted indicate the modeled distances to NMFS marine mammal Level A harassment and Level B harassment thresholds assuming 10-dB attenuation, then LOA Holder must implement additional, modified, and/or alternative noise attenuation measures or operational changes that present a reasonable likelihood of reducing sound levels to the modeled distances on all subsequent foundations. LOA Holder must also increase clearance and shutdown zone sizes to those identified by NMFS until SFV measurements on at least three additional foundations demonstrate acoustic distances to harassment thresholds meet or are less than those modeled assuming 10-dB of attenuation. In this situation, LOA Holder would be required to provide a proposed monitoring plan for expanded zones (per the Biological Opinion) that would detail the proposed expanded zones and any additional monitoring and mitigation that would be implemented. If the harassment zones are expanded beyond an additional 1,500 m (0.93 mi), additional PSOs must be deployed on additional platforms, with each observer responsible for maintaining watch in no more than 180 degrees and of an area with a radius no greater than 1,500 m.


(viii) LOA Holder must optimize the sound attenuation systems (*e.g.,* ensure hose maintenance, pressure testing, *etc.*) to, at least, meet noise levels modeled, assuming 10-dB attenuation, within three piles or else foundation installation activities must cease until NMFS and LOA Holder can evaluate the situation and ensure future piles must not exceed noise levels modeled assuming 10-dB attenuation;


(ix) If, after additional measurements conducted pursuant to requirements of paragraph (15)(vii) of this section, acoustic measurements indicate that ranges to isopleths corresponding to the Level A harassment and Level B harassment thresholds are less than the ranges predicted by modeling (assuming 10-dB attenuation), LOA Holder may request to NMFS Office of Protected Resources a modification of the clearance and shutdown zones. For NMFS Office of Protected Resources to consider a modification request for reduced zone sizes, LOA Holder must have conducted SFV measurements on an additional three WTG monopile foundations and ensure that subsequent foundations would be installed under conditions that are predicted to produce smaller harassment zones than those modeled assuming 10-dB of attenuation;


(x) LOA Holder must conduct SFV measurements upon commencement of turbine operations to estimate turbine operational source levels and transmission loss rates, in accordance with a NMFS-approved Foundation Installation Pile Driving SFV Plan. SFV must be conducted in the same manner as previously described in paragraph (c)(15) of this section, with appropriate adjustments to measurement distances, number of hydrophones, and hydrophone sensitivities being made, as necessary; and


(xi) LOA Holder must submit a SFV Plan to NMFS Office of Protected Resources for review and approval at least 180 days prior to planned start of foundation installation activities and abide by the Plan if approved. At minimum, the SFV Plan must describe how LOA Holder would ensure that the first three monopile foundation installation sites selected for SFV measurements are representative of the rest of the monopile installation sites such that future pile installation events are anticipated to produce similar sound levels to those piles measured. In the case that these sites/scenarios are not determined to be representative of all other pile installation sites, LOA Holder must include information in the SFV Plan on how additional sites/scenarios would be selected for SFV measurements. This SFV Plan must also describe approaches that LOA Holder could take to adjust noise attenuation systems or add systems in the case that any SFV measurements obtained demonstrate that noise levels are above those modeled (assuming 10 dB of attenuation). Furthermore, the SFV Plan must also include how operational noise would be monitored. Operational parameters (*e.g.,* direct drive information, turbine rotation rate) as well as sea state conditions and information on nearby anthropogenic activities (*e.g.,* vessels transiting or operating in the area) must be reported. Additionally, the SFV Plan must also include methodology for collecting, analyzing, and preparing SFV measurement data for submission to NMFS Office of Protected Resources and describe how the effectiveness of the sound attenuation methodology would be evaluated based on the results. SFV for pile driving may not occur until NMFS approves the SFV Plan for this activity.


(16) LOA Holder must submit a Foundation Installation Pile Driving Marine Mammal Monitoring Plan to NMFS Office of Protected Resources for review and approval at least 180 days prior to planned start of foundation pile driving and abide by the Plan if approved. LOA Holder must obtain both NMFS Office of Protected Resources and NMFS Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office Protected Resources Division's concurrence with this Plan prior to the start of any pile driving. The Plan must include, at a minimum: the final pile driving project design (*e.g.,* number and type of piles, hammer type, noise abatement systems, anticipated start date, *etc.*) and a description of all monitoring equipment and PAM operator and PSO protocols (including number and location of PSOs and PAM operators) for all foundation pile driving. No foundation pile installation can occur without NMFS' approval of the Plan; and


(17) LOA Holder must submit a Passive Acoustic Monitoring Plan (PAM Plan) to NMFS Office of Protected Resources for review and approval at least 180 days prior to the planned start of foundation installation activities and abide by the Plan if approved. The PAM Plan must include a description of all proposed PAM equipment, address how the proposed passive acoustic monitoring must follow standardized measurement, processing methods, reporting metrics, and metadata standards for offshore wind. The Plan must describe all proposed PAM equipment, procedures, and protocols including proof that vocalizing North Atlantic right whales will be detected within the clearance and shutdown zones. No pile installation can occur if LOA Holder's PAM Plan does not receive approval from NMFS Office of Protected Resources and NMFS Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office Protected Resources Division.


(d) *Cofferdam and goal post installation and removal.* The following requirements apply to the installation and removal of cofferdams and goal posts at the cable landfall construction sites:


(1) Installation and removal of cofferdams and goal posts must not occur during nighttime hours (defined as the hours between 1.5 hours prior to civil sunset and 1 hour after civil sunrise);


(2) LOA Holder must establish and implement clearance zones for the installation and removal of cofferdams and goal posts using visual monitoring. These zones must be measured using the radial distance from the cofferdam and goal post being installed and/or removed;


(3) LOA Holder must utilize PSO(s), as described in § 217.295(d). At least two on-duty PSOs must monitor for marine mammals at least 30 minutes before, during, and 30 minutes after vibratory and impact pile driving associated with cofferdam and casing pipe installation, respectively;


(4) If a marine mammal(s) is observed entering or is observed within the clearance zones, before vibratory or impact pile driving has begun, the activity must not commence until the animal(s) has exited the zone or a specific amount of time has elapsed since the last sighting. The specific time periods are 15 minutes for small odontocetes and pinnipeds and 30 minutes for all other marine mammal species;


(5) If a marine mammal is observed entering or within the respective shutdown zone after vibratory or impact pile driving has begun, the PSO must call for a shutdown of pile driving. LOA Holder must stop pile driving immediately unless shutdown is not practicable due to imminent risk of injury or loss of life to an individual or if there is a risk of damage to the vessel that would create a risk of injury or loss of life for individuals or if the lead engineer determines there is refusal or instability. In any of these situations, LOA Holder must document the reason(s) for not shutting down and report the information to NMFS Office of Protected Resources in the annual report (as described in § 217.295(g)). In cases where shutdown is not feasible, pile driving may restart only if necessary to maintain pile stability at which time LOA Holder must use the lowest hammer energy practicable to maintain stability;


(6) Pile driving must not restart until either the marine mammal(s) has voluntarily left the specific clearance zones and has been visually or acoustically confirmed beyond that clearance zone, or, when specific time periods have elapsed with no further sightings or acoustic detections have occurred. The specific time periods are 15 minutes for small odontocetes and pinnipeds and 30 minutes for all other marine mammal species; and


(7) LOA Holder must employ a soft-start for all impact pile driving of goal posts. Soft start requires contractors to provide an initial set of three strikes at reduced energy, followed by a 30-second waiting period, then two subsequent reduced-energy strike sets.


(e) *HRG surveys.* The following requirements apply to HRG surveys operating sub- bottom profilers (SBPs) (*i.e.,* boomers, sparkers, and Compressed High Intensity Radiated Pulse (CHIRPs)):


(1) LOA Holder must establish and implement clearance and shutdown zones for HRG surveys using visual monitoring, as described in paragraph (c) of this section;


(2) LOA Holder must utilize PSO(s), as described in § 217.295(e);


(3) LOA Holder must abide by the relevant Project Design Criteria (PDCs 4, 5, and 7) of the programmatic consultation completed by NMFS' Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office on June 29, 2021 (revised September 2021), pursuant to section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). To the extent that any relevant Best Management Practices (BMPs) described in these PDCs are more stringent than the requirements herein, those BMPs supersede these requirements;


(4) SBPs (hereinafter referred to as “acoustic sources”) must be deactivated when not acquiring data or preparing to acquire data, except as necessary for testing. Acoustic sources must be used at the lowest practicable source level to meet the survey objective, when in use, and must be turned off when they are not necessary for the survey;


(5) Prior to starting the survey and after receiving confirmation from the PSOs that the clearance zone is clear of any marine mammals, LOA Holder is required to ramp-up acoustic sources to half power for 5 minutes prior to commencing full power, unless the equipment operates on a binary on/off switch (in which case ramp-up is not required). LOA Holder must also ensure visual clearance zones are fully visible (*e.g.,* not obscured by darkness, rain, fog, *etc.*) and clear of marine mammals, as determined by the Lead PSO, for at least 30 minutes immediately prior to the initiation of survey activities using acoustic sources.


(6) Ramp-up and activation must be delayed if a marine mammal(s) enters its respective shutdown zone. Ramp-up and activation may only be reinitiated if the animal(s) has been observed exiting its respective shutdown zone or until 15 minutes for small odontocetes and pinnipeds, and 30 minutes for all other species, has elapsed with no further sightings;


(7) Prior to a ramp-up procedure starting or activating acoustic sources, the acoustic source operator (operator) must notify a designated PSO of the planned start of ramp-up as agreed upon with the Lead PSO. The notification time should not be less than 60 minutes prior to the planned ramp-up or activation in order to allow the PSOs time to monitor the clearance zone(s) for 30 minutes prior to the initiation of ramp-up or activation (pre-start clearance). During this 30-minute pre-start clearance period, the entire applicable clearance zones must be visible, except as indicated in paragraph (f)(12) of this section;


(8) Ramp-ups must be scheduled so as to minimize the time spent with the source activated;


(9) A PSO conducting pre-start clearance observations must be notified again immediately prior to reinitiating ramp-up procedures and the operator must receive confirmation from the PSO to proceed;


(10) LOA Holder must implement a 30-minute clearance period of the clearance zones immediately prior to the commencing of the survey or when there is more than a 30-minute break in survey activities or PSO monitoring. A clearance period is a period when no marine mammals are detected in the relevant zone;


(11) If a marine mammal is observed within a clearance zone during the clearance period, ramp-up or acoustic surveys may not begin until the animal(s) has been observed voluntarily exiting its respective clearance zone or until a specific time period has elapsed with no further sighting. The specific time period is 15 minutes for small odontocetes and pinnipeds, and 30 minutes for all other species;


(12) In any case when the clearance process has begun in conditions with good visibility, including via the use of night vision equipment (infrared (IR)/thermal camera), and the Lead PSO has determined that the clearance zones are clear of marine mammals, survey operations may commence (*i.e.,* no delay is required) despite periods of inclement weather and/or loss of daylight. Ramp-up may occur at times of poor visibility, including nighttime, if appropriate visual monitoring has occurred with no detections of marine mammals in the 30 minutes prior to beginning ramp-up;


(13) Once the survey has commenced, LOA Holder must shut down acoustic sources if a marine mammal enters a respective shutdown zone, except in cases when the shutdown zones become obscured for brief periods due to inclement weather, survey operations may continue (*i.e.,* no shutdown is required) so long as no marine mammals have been detected. The shutdown requirement does not apply to small delphinids of the following genera: *Delphinus, Stenella, Lagenorhynchus,* and *Tursiops.* If there is uncertainty regarding the identification of a marine mammal species (*i.e.,* whether the observed marine mammal belongs to one of the delphinid genera for which shutdown is waived), the PSOs must use their best professional judgment in making the decision to call for a shutdown. Shutdown is required if a delphinid that belongs to a genus other than those specified in this paragraph (f)(13) of this section is detected in the shutdown zone;


(14) If an acoustic source has been shut down due to the presence of a marine mammal, the use of an acoustic source may not commence or resume until the animal(s) has been confirmed to have left the Level B harassment zone or until a full 15 minutes (for small odontocetes and seals) or 30 minutes (for all other marine mammals) have elapsed with no further sighting;


(15) LOA Holder must immediately shut down any acoustic source if a marine mammal is sighted entering or within its respective shutdown zones. If there is uncertainty regarding the identification of a marine mammal species (*i.e.,* whether the observed marine mammal belongs to one of the delphinid genera for which shutdown is waived), the PSOs must use their best professional judgment in making the decision to call for a shutdown. Shutdown is required if a delphinid that belongs to a genus other than those specified in paragraph (f)(13) of this section is detected in the shutdown zone; and


(16) If an acoustic source is shut down for a period longer than 30 minutes, all clearance and ramp-up procedures must be initiated. If an acoustic source is shut down for reasons other than mitigation (*e.g.,* mechanical difficulty) for less than 30 minutes, acoustic sources may be activated again without ramp-up only if PSOs have maintained constant observation and no additional detections of any marine mammal occurred within the respective shutdown zones.


(f) *Fisheries monitoring surveys.* The following measures apply to fishery monitoring surveys: using trap/pot gear:


(1) Survey gear must be deployed as soon as possible once the vessel arrives on station. Gear must not be deployed if there is a risk of interaction with marine mammals. Gear may be deployed after 15 minutes of no marine mammal sightings within 1 nautical mile (nmi; 1,852 m) of the sampling station;


(2) LOA Holder and/or its cooperating institutions, contracted vessels, or commercially hired captains must implement the following “move-on” rule: If marine mammals are sighted within 1 nautical mile (nmi (1.2 mi)) of the planned location and 15 minutes before gear deployment, then LOA Holder and/or its cooperating institutions, contracted vessels, or commercially hired captains, as appropriate, must move the vessel away from the marine mammal to a different section of the sampling area. If, after moving on, marine mammals are still visible from the vessel, LOA Holder and its cooperating institutions, contracted vessels, or commercially hired captains must move again or skip the station;


(3) If a marine mammal is at risk of interacting with deployed gear, all gear must be immediately removed from the water. If marine mammals are sighted before the gear is fully removed from the water, the vessel must slow its speed and maneuver the vessel away from the animals to minimize potential interactions with the observed animal;


(4) Unless using ropeless gear, LOA Holder must maintain visual marine mammal monitoring effort during the entire period of time that gear is in the water (*i.e.,* throughout gear deployment, fishing, and retrieval);


(5) All fisheries monitoring gear must be fully cleaned and repaired (if damaged) before each use/deployment;


(6) LOA Holder's fixed gear must comply with the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan regulations at 50 CFR 229.32 during fisheries monitoring surveys;


(7) Trawl tows must be limited to a maximum of a 20-minute trawl time at 3.0 kn (3.5 mph);


(8) All gear must be emptied as close to the deck/sorting area and as quickly as possible after retrieval;


(9) All fishery survey-related lines must include the breaking strength of all lines being less than 1,700 pounds (lbs; 771 kilograms (kg)). This may be accomplished by using whole buoy line that has a breaking strength of 1,700 lbs; or buoy line with weak inserts that result in line having an overall breaking strength of 1,700 lbs;


(10) During any survey that uses vertical lines, buoy lines must be weighted and must not float at the surface of the water and all groundlines must consist of sinking lines. All groundlines must be composed entirely of sinking lines. Buoy lines must utilize weak links. Weak links must break cleanly leaving behind the bitter end of the line. The bitter end of the line must be free of any knots when the weak link breaks. Splices are not considered to be knots. The attachment of buoys, toggles, or other floatation devices to groundlines is prohibited;


(11) All in-water survey gear, including buoys, must be properly labeled with the scientific permit number or identification as LOA Holder's research gear. All labels and markings on the gear, buoys, and buoy lines must also be compliant with the applicable regulations, and all buoy markings must comply with instructions received by the NOAA Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office Protected Resources Division;


(12) All survey gear must be removed from the water whenever not in active survey use (*i.e.,* no wet storage); and


(13) All reasonable efforts, that do not compromise human safety, must be undertaken to recover gear.
