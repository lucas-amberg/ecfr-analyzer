(5) *Annual report.* (i) AGDC must submit a comprehensive annual report to NMFS within 90 calendar days of the cessation of in-water work each year for review. The report must synthesize all sighting data and effort during each activity for each year.


(ii) NMFS will provide comments within 30 days after receiving annual reports, and AGDC must address the comments and submit revisions within 30 days after receiving NMFS comments.


(iii) If no comments are received from the NMFS within 30 days, the annual report is considered completed.

(*2*) Closest point of approach versus project activity;


(*3*) Observed behaviors and types of movements versus project activity;


(*4*) Numbers of sightings/individuals seen versus project activity;


(*5*) Distribution around the source vessels versus project activity; and


(*6*) Numbers of animals detected in the exclusion zone.


(G) Analyses of the effects of project activities on listed marine mammals.


(6) *Final report.* (i) AGDC must provide NMFS, within 90 days of project completion at the end of the five-year period, a report of all parameters listed in the monthly and annual report requirements in paragraph (c) of this section, noting also all operational shutdowns or delays necessitated due to the proximity of marine mammals.


(ii) NMFS will provide comments within 30 days after receiving this report, and AGDC must address the comments and submit revisions within 30 days after receiving NMFS comments.


(iii) If no comments are received from the NMFS within 30 days, the final report is considered as final.


(7) *Reporting of injured or dead marine mammals.* (i) In the unanticipated event that the construction or demolition activities clearly cause the take of a marine mammal in a prohibited manner, such as an injury, serious injury, or mortality, AGDC must immediately cease operations with the potential to impact marine mammals in the vicinity and immediately report the incident to the NMFS Office of Protected Resources, NMFS Alaska Regional Office, and the Alaska Region Stranding Coordinators. The report must include the following information:


(A) Time, date, and location (latitude/longitude) of the incident;


(B) Description of the incident;


(C) Status of all sound source use in the 24 hours preceding the incident;


(D) Environmental conditions (*e.g.,* wind speed and direction, sea state, cloud cover, visibility, and water depth);


(E) Description of marine mammal observations in the 24 hours preceding the incident;


(F) Species identification or description of the animal(s) involved;


(G) The fate of the animal(s); and


(H) Photographs or video footage of the animal (if equipment is available).


(ii) Activities must not resume until NMFS is able to review the circumstances of the prohibited take. NMFS must work with AGDC to determine what is necessary to minimize the likelihood of further prohibited take and ensure Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) compliance. AGDC may not resume its activities until notified by NMFS via letter, email, or telephone.


(iii) In the event that AGDC discovers an injured or dead marine mammal, and the lead PSO determines that the cause of the injury or death is unknown and the death is relatively recent (*i.e.,* in less than a moderate state of decomposition as described in paragraph (c)(7)(iv) of this section), AGDC must immediately report the incident to the NMFS Office of Protected Resources, NMFS Alaska Regional Office, and the Alaska Regional Stranding Coordinators. The report must include the same information identified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. Activities may continue while NMFS reviews the circumstances of the incident. NMFS will work with AGDC to determine whether modifications in the activities are appropriate.


(iv) In the event that AGDC discovers an injured or dead marine mammal, and the lead PSO determines that the injury or death is not associated with or related to the activities authorized in the LOA (*e.g.,* previously wounded animal, carcass with moderate to advanced decomposition, or scavenger damage), AGDC must report the incident to the NMFS Office of Protected Resources, NMFS Alaska Regional Office, and the Alaska Regional Stranding Coordinators, within 48 hours of the discovery. AGDC must provide photographs or video footage (if available) or other documentation of the stranded animal sighting to NMFS and the Marine Mammal Stranding Network. AGDC may continue its operations under such a case.
