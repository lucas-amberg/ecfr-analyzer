(a) *Protected species observer (PSO) and passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) operator qualifications.* LOA Holder must implement the following measures applicable to PSOs and PAM operators:


(1) LOA Holder must use independent, NMFS-approved PSOs and PAM operators (*i.e.,* the PSOs and PAM operators must be employed by a third-party observer provider) must have no tasks other than to conduct observational effort, collect data, and communicate with and instruct relevant crew with regard to the presence of protected species and mitigation requirements;


(2) All PSOs and PAM operators must have successfully attained a bachelor's degree in one of the natural sciences. The educational requirements may be waived if the PSO or PAM operator has acquired the relevant skills through a suitable amount of alternate experience. Requests for such a waiver must be submitted to NMFS Office of Protected Resources and must include written justification containing alternative experience. Alternate experiences that may be considered include but are not limited to: previous work experience conducting academic, commercial, or government-sponsored marine mammal visual and/or acoustic surveys; or previous work experience as a PSO/PAM operator. All PSOs and PAM operators should demonstrate good standing and consistently good performance of all assigned duties;

The report must include time, date, and location (*i.e.,* specify coordinate system) of the incident; species identification (if known) or description of the animal(s) involved (*i.e.,* identifiable features including animal color, presence of dorsal fin, body shape and size, *etc.*); vessel strike reported information (*e.g.,* name, affiliation, email for person completing the report); vessel strike witness (if different than the reporter) information (*e.g.,* name, affiliation, phone number, platform for person witnessing the event, *etc.*); vessel name and/or MMSI number; vessel size and motor configuration (inboard, outboard, jet propulsion); vessel's speed leading up to and during the incident; vessel's course/heading and what operations were being conducted (if applicable); part of vessel that struck marine mammal (if known); vessel damage notes; status of all sound sources in use at the time of the strike; if the marine mammal was seen before the strike event; description of behavior of the marine mammal before the strike event (if seen) and behavior immediately following the strike; description of avoidance measures/requirements that were in place at the time of the strike and what additional measures were taken, if any, to avoid strike; environmental conditions (*e.g.,* wind speed and direction, Beaufort sea state, cloud cover, visibility, *etc.*) immediately preceding the strike; estimated (or actual, if known) size and length of marine mammal that was struck; if available, description of the presence and behavior of any other marine mammals immediately preceding the strike; other animal-specific details, if known (*e.g.,* length, sex, age class); behavior or estimated fate of the marine mammal post-strike (*e.g.,* dead, injured but alive, injured and moving, external visible wounds (linear wounds, propeller wounds, non-cutting blunt-force trauma wounds), blood or tissue observed in the water, status unknown, disappeared); to the extent practicable, any photographs or video footage of the marine mammal(s); and, any additional notes the witness may have from the interaction. For any numerical values provided (*i.e.,* location, animal length, vessel length, *etc.*), please provide if values are actual or estimated. The LOA Holder must immediately cease activities until the NMFS Office of Protected Resources is able to review the circumstances of the incident and determine what, if any, additional measures are appropriate to ensure compliance with the terms of the LOA. NMFS Office of Protected Resources may impose additional measures to minimize the likelihood of further prohibited take and ensure MMPA compliance. The LOA Holder may not resume their activities until notified by NMFS Office of Protected Resources.


(15) Any lost gear associated with the fishery surveys will be reported to the NOAA Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office Protected Resources Division (*nmfs.gar.incidentaltake@noaa.gov*) as soon as possible or but no later than 24 hours of the documented time of missing or lost gear. This report must include information on any markings on the gear and any efforts undertaken or planned to recover the gear. All reasonable efforts, that do not compromise human safety, must be undertaken to recover gear.
