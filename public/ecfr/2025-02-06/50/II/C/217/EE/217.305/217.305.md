# § 217.305   Monitoring and reporting requirements.

(a) *Protected species observer (PSO) and passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) operator qualifications.* LOA Holder must implement the following measures applicable to PSOs and PAM operators:


(1) LOA Holder must use independent, NMFS-approved PSOs and PAM operators (*i.e.,* the PSOs and PAM operators must be employed by a third-party observer provider) must have no tasks other than to conduct observational effort, collect data, and communicate with and instruct relevant crew with regard to the presence of protected species and mitigation requirements;


(2) All PSOs and PAM operators must have successfully attained a bachelor's degree in one of the natural sciences. The educational requirements may be waived if the PSO or PAM operator has acquired the relevant skills through a suitable amount of alternate experience. Requests for such a waiver must be submitted to NMFS Office of Protected Resources and must include written justification containing alternative experience. Alternate experiences that may be considered include but are not limited to: previous work experience conducting academic, commercial, or government-sponsored marine mammal visual and/or acoustic surveys; or previous work experience as a PSO/PAM operator. All PSOs and PAM operators should demonstrate good standing and consistently good performance of all assigned duties;


(3) PSOs must have visual acuity in both eyes (with correction of vision being permissible) sufficient enough to discern moving targets on the water's surface with the ability to estimate the target size and distance (binocular use is allowable); ability to conduct field observations and collect data according to the assigned protocols; sufficient training, orientation, or experience with the construction operation to provide for personal safety during observations; writing skills sufficient to document observations, including but not limited to, the number and species of marine mammals observed, the dates and times of when in-water construction activities were conducted, the dates and time when in-water construction activities were suspended to avoid potential incidental take of marine mammals from construction noise within a defined shutdown zone, and marine mammal behavior; and the ability to communicate orally, by radio, or in-person, with Project personnel to provide real-time information on marine mammals observed in the area;


(4) All PSOs must be trained in northwestern Atlantic Ocean marine mammal identification and behaviors and must be able to conduct field observations and collect data according to assigned protocols.

(6) PSOs are responsible for obtaining NMFS' approval. NMFS may approve PSOs as conditional or unconditional. A conditionally approved PSO may be one who has completed training in the last 5 years but has not yet attained the requisite field experience. An unconditionally approved PSO is one who has completed training within the last 5 years and attained the necessary experience (*i.e.,* demonstrate experience with monitoring for marine mammals at clearance and shutdown zone sizes similar to those produced during the respective activity);


(7) At least one PSO for each activity (*e.g.,* foundation installation, cable landfall construction, and HRG surveys) on each vessel must be designated as the Lead PSO. The Lead PSO must meet the minimum requirements described in paragraphs (a)(2) through (5) of this section and have a minimum of 90 days of at-sea experience visually monitoring marine mammals, including baleen whales, and no more than 18 months may have elapsed since the conclusion of their last at-sea experience;


(8) PSOs for cable landfall construction (*i.e.,* vibratory pile installation and removal) and HRG surveys may be unconditionally or conditionally approved. A conditionally approved PSO must be paired with an unconditionally approved PSO. PSOs for foundation installation must be unconditionally approved;


(9) PAM operators are responsible for obtaining NMFS approval. To be approved as a PAM operator, the person must meet the following qualifications. The PAM operator must: demonstrate that they have prior experience with relevant acoustic software and equipment and real-time acoustic detection systems and/or have completed specialized training for operating PAM systems and detecting and identifying Atlantic Ocean marine mammals sounds, in particular: North Atlantic right whale sounds, humpback whale sounds, and how to deconflict them from similar North Atlantic right whale sounds, and other co-occurring species' sounds in the area including sperm whales; be able to distinguish between whether a marine mammal or other species sound is detected, possibly detected, or not detected; be able to review and classify acoustic detections in real-time (prioritizing North Atlantic right whales and noting detection of other cetaceans) during the real-time monitoring periods where localization of sounds or deriving bearings and distance are possible and demonstrate experience in using this technique; have the qualifications and relevant experience/training to safely deploy and retrieve equipment and program the software, as necessary; and must be able to test software and hardware functionality prior to operation;


(10) LOA Holder must submit previously approved PSOs and PAM operators to NMFS Office of Protected Resources for review and confirmation of their approval for specific roles at least 30 business days prior to commencement of the activities requiring PSOs/PAM operators or 15 business days prior to when new PSOs/PAM operators are required after activities have commenced;


(11) For prospective PSOs and PAM operators not previously approved, or for PSOs and PAM operators whose approval is not current, LOA Holder must submit resumes for approval at least 60 business days prior to PSO and PAM operator use. Resumes must include information related to relevant education, experience, and training, including dates, duration, location, and description of prior PSO or PAM operator experience. Resumes must be accompanied by relevant documentation of successful completion of necessary training;

PAM operator(s) must immediately communicate all acoustic detections of marine mammals to PSOs, including any determination regarding species identification, distance, and bearing (where relevant) relative to the pile being driven and the degree of confidence (*e.g.,* possible, probable detection) in the determination. All on-duty PSOs and PAM operator(s) must remain in contact with the on-duty construction personnel responsible for implementing mitigations (*e.g.,* delay to pile driving) to ensure communication on marine mammal observations can easily, quickly, and consistently occur between all on-duty PSOs, PAM operator(s), and on-water Project personnel;


(4) The PAM operator must inform the Lead PSO(s) on duty of animal detections, including any determination regarding species identification, distance, bearing, and degree of confidence in the determinations, approaching or within applicable ranges of interest to the activity occurring via the data collection software system, (*e.g., Mysticetus* or similar system) who must be responsible for requesting that the designated crewmember implement the necessary mitigation procedures (*i.e.,* delay);


(5) PSOs must use high magnification (25x) binoculars, standard handheld (7x) binoculars, and the naked eye to search continuously for marine mammals. During foundation installation, at least two PSOs on the pile driving-dedicated PSO vessel(s) must be equipped with functional Big Eye binoculars (*e.g.,* 25 × 150; 2.7 view angle; individual ocular focus; height control); these must be pedestal mounted on the deck at the best vantage point that provides for optimal sea surface observation and PSO safety;

Additionally, LOA Holder must use two dedicated-PSO vessels and each vessel must have at least three PSOs on duty. LOA Holder may request NMFS approval to use alternative technology *in lieu* of one or two of the dedicated PSO vessels that provide similar marine mammal detection capabilities. If NMFS approves the use of alternative technology *in lieu* of the additional PSO vessels, LOA Holder must abide by any conditions of approved, as specified by NMFS;


(2) PSOs and PAM operator(s), using a NMFS-approved PAM system, must monitor for marine mammals 60 minutes prior to, during, and 30 minutes following all pile-driving. If PSOs cannot visually monitor the minimum visibility zone for the 60 minutes prior to and during pile driving, pile-driving operations must not commence or must shutdown if they are currently active; and


(3) LOA Holder must conduct PAM for at least 24 hours prior to pile driving activities. The PAM operator(s) must review all detections from the previous 24-hour period prior to starting foundation pile driving.

The report must include time, date, and location (*i.e.,* specify coordinate system) of the incident; species identification (if known) or description of the animal(s) involved (*i.e.,* identifiable features including animal color, presence of dorsal fin, body shape and size, *etc.*); vessel strike reported information (*e.g.,* name, affiliation, email for person completing the report); vessel strike witness (if different than the reporter) information (*e.g.,* name, affiliation, phone number, platform for person witnessing the event, *etc.*); vessel name and/or MMSI number; vessel size and motor configuration (inboard, outboard, jet propulsion); vessel's speed leading up to and during the incident; vessel's course/heading and what operations were being conducted (if applicable); part of vessel that struck marine mammal (if known); vessel damage notes; status of all sound sources in use at the time of the strike; if the marine mammal was seen before the strike event; description of behavior of the marine mammal before the strike event (if seen) and behavior immediately following the strike; description of avoidance measures/requirements that were in place at the time of the strike and what additional measures were taken, if any, to avoid strike; environmental conditions (*e.g.,* wind speed and direction, Beaufort sea state, cloud cover, visibility, *etc.*) immediately preceding the strike; estimated (or actual, if known) size and length of marine mammal that was struck; if available, description of the presence and behavior of any other marine mammals immediately preceding the strike; other animal-specific details, if known (*e.g.,* length, sex, age class); behavior or estimated fate of the marine mammal post-strike (*e.g.,* dead, injured but alive, injured and moving, external visible wounds (linear wounds, propeller wounds, non-cutting blunt-force trauma wounds), blood or tissue observed in the water, status unknown, disappeared); to the extent practicable, any photographs or video footage of the marine mammal(s); and, any additional notes the witness may have from the interaction. For any numerical values provided (*i.e.,* location, animal length, vessel length, *etc.*), please provide if values are actual or estimated. The LOA Holder must immediately cease activities until the NMFS Office of Protected Resources is able to review the circumstances of the incident and determine what, if any, additional measures are appropriate to ensure compliance with the terms of the LOA. NMFS Office of Protected Resources may impose additional measures to minimize the likelihood of further prohibited take and ensure MMPA compliance. The LOA Holder may not resume their activities until notified by NMFS Office of Protected Resources.


(15) Any lost gear associated with the fishery surveys will be reported to the NOAA Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office Protected Resources Division (*nmfs.gar.incidentaltake@noaa.gov*) as soon as possible or but no later than 24 hours of the documented time of missing or lost gear. This report must include information on any markings on the gear and any efforts undertaken or planned to recover the gear. All reasonable efforts, that do not compromise human safety, must be undertaken to recover gear.
