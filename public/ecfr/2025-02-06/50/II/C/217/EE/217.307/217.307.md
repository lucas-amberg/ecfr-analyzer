# § 217.307   Modifications of Letter of Authorization.

(a) Any LOA issued under §§ 217.302 and 217.306 or this section for the activities identified in § 217.300(a) may be modified upon request by LOA Holder, provided that:


(1) The specified activity and mitigation, monitoring, and reporting measures, as well as the anticipated impacts, are the same as those described and analyzed for this subpart (excluding changes made pursuant to the adaptive management provision in paragraph (c)(1) of this section); and


(2) NMFS Office of Protected Resources determines that the mitigation, monitoring, and reporting measures required by the previous LOA under this subpart were implemented.


(b) For any modification request to the LOA by the applicant that includes changes to the activities or the mitigation, monitoring, or reporting (excluding changes made pursuant to the adaptive management provision in paragraph (c)(1) of this section), the LOA may be modified, provided that:


(1) NMFS Office of Protected Resources determines that the changes to the activity or the mitigation, monitoring, or reporting do not change the findings made for the regulations in this subpart and do not result in more than a minor change in the maximum annual or total estimated number of takes of any species or stock; and


(2) NMFS Office of Protected Resources may, if appropriate, publish a notice of proposed modified LOA in the _Federal Register,_ including the associated analysis of the change, and solicit public comment before issuing the LOA.


(c) LOA issued under §§ 217.302 and 217.306 or this section for the activities identified in § 217.300(a) may be modified by NMFS under the following circumstances:


(1) Through adaptive management, NMFS Office of Protected Resources may modify (*e.g.,* delete, modify, or add to) the existing mitigation, monitoring, or reporting measures (after consulting with the LOA Holder regarding the practicability of the modifications), if doing so creates a reasonable likelihood of more effectively accomplishing the goals of the mitigation and monitoring;


(i) Possible sources of data that could contribute to the decision to modify the mitigation, monitoring, or reporting measures in the LOA include, but are not limited to:


(A) Results from LOA Holder's monitoring;


(B) Results from other marine mammals and/or sound research or studies; and


(C) Any information that reveals marine mammals may have been taken in a manner, extent, or number not allowed by the regulations in this subpart or subsequent LOA.


(ii) If, through adaptive management, the modifications to the mitigation, monitoring, or reporting measures are substantial, NMFS Office of Protected Resources shall publish a notice of proposed LOA in the _Federal Register_ and solicit public comment.


(2) If NMFS Office of Protected Resources determines that an emergency exists that poses a significant risk to the well-being of the species or stocks of marine mammals specified in the LOA issued pursuant to §§ 217.302 and 217.306 or this section, any LOA may be modified without prior notice or opportunity for public comment. Notice would be published in the _Federal Register_ within 30 calendar days of the issuance of a LOA under this subpart.
