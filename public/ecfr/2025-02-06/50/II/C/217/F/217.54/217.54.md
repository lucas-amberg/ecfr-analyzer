# ยง 217.54   Mitigation requirements.

When conducting the activities identified in ยง 217.50(a), the mitigation measures contained in any LOA issued under ยง 216.106 of this chapter and ยง 217.56 must be implemented. These mitigation measures shall include but are not limited to:


(a) *General conditions.* (1) A copy of any issued LOA must be in the possession of the Society, supervisory personnel, pilot, protected species observers (PSOs), and any other relevant designees of the Holder operating under the authority of this LOA at all times that activities subject to this LOA are being conducted.


(2) The Society must conduct training between supervisors and crews and the marine mammal monitoring team and relevant Society staff prior to the start of all trips and when new personnel join the work, so that responsibilities, communication procedures, monitoring protocols, and operational procedures are clearly understood. Visitors to the Station must be instructed to avoid unnecessary noise and not expose themselves visually to pinnipeds around the base of the lighthouse.


(3) All personnel must avoid direct physical interaction with marine mammals during activity. If a marine mammal comes within 10 m of such activity, operations must cease until the animal leaves of its own accord.


(4) Loud outside activity must be halted upon observation on Northwest Seal Rock (NWSR) of either a species for which incidental take is not authorized or a species for which incidental take has been authorized but the authorized number of takes has been met.


(5) No more than two restoration trips, or 6 days of flight operations, are permitted per month.


(b) *Protocols.* (1) The pilot must ensure that helicopter approach patterns to the NWSR are such that the timing and techniques are least disturbing to marine mammals. To the extent possible, the helicopter must approach NWSR when the tide is too high for marine mammals to haul out on NWSR. The helicopter must avoid rapid and direct approaches to the station by approaching NWSR at a relatively high altitude (*e.g.,* 800-1,000 ft; 244-305 m). Before the final approach, the helicopter must circle lower, and approach from an area where the density of pinnipeds is the lowest. If for any safety reasons (*e.g.,* wind conditions or visibility) such helicopter approach and timing techniques cannot be achieved, the Society must abort the restoration and maintenance session for the day.


(2) Monitoring must be conducted by a trained PSO, who must have no other assigned tasks during monitoring periods. Trained PSOs must be placed at the best vantage point(s) practicable to monitor for marine mammals and implement mitigation procedures when applicable. The Society must adhere to the following additional PSO qualifications:


(i) Independent PSOs are required;


(ii) At least one PSO must have prior experience working as an observer;


(iii) Other observers may substitute education (degree in biological science or related field) or training for experience; and


(iv) The Society must submit PSO resumes for approval by NMFS prior to beginning any activity subject to these regulations.


(3) The PSO must monitor the project area to the maximum extent possible based on the required monitoring locations and environmental conditions. They must record all observations of marine mammals as described in Section 5 of any LOA, regardless of distance from the activity. A PSO with a high definition camera must be on the first flight to the station each day. For 15 minutes before and after all other takeoffs and landings a PSO must be stationed on the platform of the lantern room gallery, and a PSO must be on the last departing helicopter of the day.
