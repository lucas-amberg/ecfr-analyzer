# ยง 217.315   Monitoring and reporting requirements.

Sunrise Wind must implement the following monitoring and reporting requirements when conducting the specified activities (see ยง 217.310(c)):


(a) Protected species observer (PSO) and passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) operator qualifications: Sunrise Wind must implement the following measures applicable to PSOs and PAM operators:


(1) Sunrise Wind must use independent, NMFS-approved PSOs and PAM operators, meaning that the PSOs and PAM operators must be employed by a third-party observer provider, must have no tasks other than to conduct observational effort, collect data, and communicate with and instruct relevant personnel with regard to the presence of protected species and mitigation requirements;


(2) All PSOs and PAM operators must have successfully attained a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university with a major in one of the natural sciences, a minimum of 30 semester hours or equivalent in the biological sciences, and at least one undergraduate course in math or statistics. The educational requirements may be waived if the PSO or PAM operator has acquired the relevant skills through a suitable amount of alternate experience. Requests for such a waiver must be submitted to NMFS Office of Protected Resources and must include written justification containing alternative experience. Alternate experience that may be considered includes, but is not limited to, previous work experience conducting academic, commercial, or government-sponsored marine mammal visual and/or acoustic surveys; or previous work experience as a PSO/PAM operator;


(3) PSOs must have visual acuity in both eyes (with correction of vision being permissible) sufficient enough to discern moving targets on the water's surface with the ability to estimate the target size and distance (binocular use is allowable); ability to conduct field observations and collect data according to the assigned protocols; sufficient training, orientation, or experience with the construction operation to provide for personal safety during observations; writing skills sufficient to document observations, including but not limited to, the number and species of marine mammals observed, the dates and times of when in-water construction activities were conducted, the dates and time when in-water construction activities were suspended to avoid potential incidental take of marine mammals from construction noise within a defined shutdown zone, and marine mammal behavior; and the ability to communicate orally, by radio, or in-person, with project personnel to provide real-time information on marine mammals observed in the area;


(4) All PSOs must be trained in northwestern Atlantic Ocean marine mammal identification and behaviors and must be able to conduct field observations and collect data according to assigned protocols. Additionally, PSOs must have the ability to work with all required and relevant software and equipment necessary during observations described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section);


(5) All PSOs and PAM operators must successfully complete a relevant training course within the last 5 years and obtain a certificate of course completion;


(6) PSOs and PAM operators are responsible for obtaining NMFS' approval. NMFS may approve PSOs as conditional or unconditional. A conditionally approved PSO may be one who has completed training in the last 5 years but has not yet attained the requisite field experience. An unconditionally approved PSO is one who has completed training within the last 5 years and attained the necessary experience (*i.e.,* demonstrate experience with monitoring for marine mammals at clearance and shutdown zone sizes similar to those produced during the respective activity). A conditionally approved PSO must be paired with an unconditionally approved PSO;


(7) PSOs for cable landfall and temporary pier construction (*i.e.,* vibratory and impact pile installation and removal; pneumatic hammering) and HRG surveys may be unconditionally or conditionally approved. PSOs and PAM operators for foundation installation and UXO detonation must be unconditionally approved;


(8) At least one on-duty PSO for each activity (*e.g.,* foundation installation, cable landfall and temporary pier construction, and HRG surveys) must be designated as the Lead PSO. The Lead PSO must meet the minimum requirements described in paragraphs (a)(2) through (5) of this section, have a minimum of ninety days of at-sea experience working in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean and have no more than eighteen months elapsed since the conclusion of their last at-sea experience;


(9) Sunrise Wind must submit NMFS previously approved PSOs and PAM operators to NMFS Office of Protected Resources for review and confirmation of their approval for specific roles at least 30 days prior to commencement of the activities requiring PSOs/PAM operators or 15 days prior to when new PSOs/PAM operators are required after activities have commenced;


(10) For prospective PSOs and PAM operators not previously approved, or for PSOs and PAM operators whose approval is not current, Sunrise Wind must submit resumes for approval at least 60 days prior to PSO and PAM operator use. Resumes must include information related to relevant education, experience, and training, including dates, duration, location, and description of prior PSO or PAM operator experience. Resumes must be accompanied by relevant documentation of successful completion of necessary training;


(11) To be approved as a PAM operator, the person must meet the following qualifications: the PAM operator must demonstrate that they have prior experience with real-time acoustic detection systems and/or have completed specialized training for operating PAM systems, including experience with relevant Project acoustic software and equipment. They must also demonstrate experience detecting and identifying Atlantic Ocean marine mammals sounds, including North Atlantic right whale sounds, humpback whale sounds and deconflicting them from similar North Atlantic right whale sounds and other co-occurring species' sounds in the area. The PAM operator must be able to review and classify acoustic detections in real-time (prioritizing North Atlantic right whales and noting detection of other cetaceans) during the real-time monitoring periods and must be able to distinguish between whether a marine mammal or other species sound is detected, possibly detected, not detected. Where localization of sounds or deriving bearings and distance are possible, the PAM operators must demonstrate experience in using this technique. PAM operators must have the qualifications and relevant experience/training to safely deploy and retrieve equipment and program the software, as necessary and test software and hardware functionality prior to operation; and


(12) PSOs may work as PAM operators and vice versa, pending NMFS-approval; however, they may only perform one role at any one time and must not exceed work time restrictions, which must be tallied cumulatively.


(b) *General PSO and PAM operator requirements.* The following measures apply to PSOs and PAM operators and must be implemented by Sunrise Wind:


(1) All PSOs must be located at the best vantage point(s) on any platform, as determined by the Lead PSO, in order to collectively obtain 360-degree visual coverage of the entire clearance and shutdown zones around the activity area, and as much of the Level B harassment zone as possible. PAM operators may be located on a vessel or remotely on-shore, but must have the appropriate equipment (*i.e.,* computer station equipped with a data collection software system and acoustic data analysis software) available wherever they are stationed, and data or data products must be streamed in real-time or in near real-time to allow PAM operators to provide assistance to on-duty visual PSOs;


(2) PSOs must use high magnification (25x) binoculars, standard handheld (7x) binoculars, and the naked eye to search continuously for marine mammals. During foundation installation, at least two PSOs on the pile driving-dedicated PSO vessel must be equipped with functional Big Eye binoculars (*e.g.,* 25 x 150; 2.7 view angle; individual ocular focus; height control). These must be pedestal mounted on the deck at the best vantage point that provides for optimal sea surface observation and PSO safety. PAM operators must use a NMFS-approved PAM system to conduct monitoring;


(3) During periods of low visibility (*e.g.,* darkness, rain, fog, poor weather conditions, *etc.*), PSOs must use alternative technology (*e.g.,* infrared or thermal cameras) to monitor the mitigation zones;


(4) PSOs and PAM operators must not exceed 4 consecutive watch hours on duty at any time, must have a 2-hour (minimum) break between watches, and must not exceed a combined watch schedule of more than 12 hours in a 24-hour period;


(5) For UXO/MEC detonation areas larger than 2 km, Sunrise Wind must use a secondary PSO vessel to monitor for marine mammals. For any additional vessels determined to be necessary, three PSOs must be used and located at the appropriate vantage point on the vessel. These additional PSOs would maintain watch during the same time period as the PSOs on the primary monitoring vessel. For detonation areas larger than 5 km, Sunrise Wind must use an aircraft or additional PSO vessels in addition to the primary monitoring vessel to monitor for marine mammals. If an aircraft is used, two PSOs must be used and located at the appropriate vantage point on the aircraft. These additional PSOs would maintain watch during the same time period as the PSOs on the primary monitoring vessel;


(6) During foundation installation and UXO/MEC detonation, Sunrise Wind must conduct PAM for at least 24 hours immediately prior to pile driving activities. The PAM operator must review all detections from the previous 24-hour period immediately prior to pile driving;


(7) During cable landfall construction, at least two PSOs must be on active duty 30 minutes prior to, during, and 30 minutes after all pile driving activities; and


(8) Sunrise Wind must ensure that visual PSOs conduct, as rotation schedules allow, observations for comparison of sighting rates and behavior with and without use of the specified acoustic sources. Off-effort PSO monitoring must be reflected in the PSO monitoring reports.


(c) *Reporting.* Sunrise Wind must comply with the reporting measures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (20) of this section:
