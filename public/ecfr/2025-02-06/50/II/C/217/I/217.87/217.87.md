# § 217.87   Renewals and modifications of Letters of Authorization.

(a) An LOA issued under §§  216.106 of this chapter and 217.86 for the activity identified in §  217.80(a) may be renewed or modified upon request by the applicant, provided that:


(1) The specified activity and mitigation, monitoring, and reporting measures, as well as the anticipated impacts, are the same as those described and analyzed for these regulations; and


(2) NMFS determines that the mitigation, monitoring, and reporting measures required by the previous LOA under these regulations were implemented.


(b) For LOA modification or renewal requests by the applicant that include changes to the activity or the mitigation, monitoring, or reporting that do not change the findings made for the regulations or result in no more than a minor change in the total estimated number of takes (or distribution by species or years), NMFS may publish a notice of proposed LOA in the _Federal Register,_ including the associated analysis of the change, and solicit public comment before issuing the LOA.


(c) An LOA issued under §§  216.106 of this chapter and 217.86 for the activity identified in §  217.80 (a) may be modified by NMFS under the following circumstances:


(1) NMFS may modify (including augment) the existing mitigation, monitoring, or reporting measures (after consulting with Navy regarding the practicability of the modifications) if doing so creates a reasonable likelihood of more effectively accomplishing the goals of the mitigation and monitoring set forth in the preamble for these regulations;


(i) Possible sources of data that could contribute to the decision to modify the mitigation, monitoring, or reporting measures in an LOA:


(A) Results from Navy's monitoring from previous years;


(B) Results from other marine mammal and/or sound research or studies; and


(C) Any information that reveals marine mammals may have been taken in a manner, extent or number not authorized by these regulations or subsequent LOAs; and


(ii) If, through adaptive management, the modifications to the mitigation, monitoring, or reporting measures are substantial, NMFS must publish a notice of proposed LOA in the _Federal Register_ and solicit public comment; and


(2) If NMFS determines that an emergency exists that poses a significant risk to the well-being of the species or stocks of marine mammals specified in a LOA issued pursuant to §§  216.106 of this chapter and 217.86, a LOA may be modified without prior notice or opportunity for public comment. Notification will be published in the _Federal Register_ within 30 days of the action.
