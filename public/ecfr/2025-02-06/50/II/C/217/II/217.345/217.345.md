# ยง 217.345   Monitoring and reporting requirements.

(a) *PSO and PAM operator qualifications.* LOA Holder must implement the following measures applicable to PSOs and PAM operators:


(1) LOA Holder must use independent, NMFS-approved PSOs and PAM operators, meaning that the PSOs and PAM operators must be employed by a third-party observer provider, must have no tasks other than to conduct observational effort, collect data, and communicate with and instruct relevant crew with regard to the presence of protected species and mitigation requirements;


(2) All PSOs and PAM operators must have successfully attained a bachelor's degree with a major in one of the natural sciences. The educational requirements may be waived if the PSO or PAM operator has acquired the relevant skills through a suitable amount of alternate experience. Requests for such a waiver must be submitted to NMFS Office of Protected Resources and must include written justification containing alternative experience. Alternate experience that may be considered includes, but is not limited to previous work experience conducting academic, commercial, or government-sponsored marine mammal visual and/or acoustic surveys, or previous work experience as a PSO/PAM operator;


(3) PSOs must have visual acuity in both eyes (with correction of vision being permissible) sufficient enough to discern moving targets on the water's surface with the ability to estimate the target size and distance (binocular use is allowable); ability to conduct field observations and collect data according to the assigned protocols; sufficient training, orientation, or experience with the construction operation to provide for personal safety during observations; writing skills sufficient to document observations, including but not limited to, the number and species of marine mammals observed, the dates and times when in-water construction activities were conducted, the dates and time when in-water construction activities were suspended to avoid potential incidental take of marine mammals from construction noise within a defined shutdown zone, and marine mammal behavior; and the ability to communicate orally, by radio, or in-person, with project personnel to provide real-time information on marine mammals observed in the area;


(4) All PSOs must be trained in northwestern Atlantic Ocean marine mammal identification and behaviors and must be able to conduct field observations and collect data according to assigned protocols. Additionally, PSOs must have the ability to work with all required and relevant software and equipment necessary during observations (as described in paragraphs (b)(6) and (8) of this section;


(5) All PSOs and PAM operators must successfully complete a relevant training course within the last 5 years, including obtaining a certificate of course completion that must be submitted to NMFS. This requirement is waived for any PSOs and PAM operators that completed a relevant training course more than five years prior to seeking approval but have been working consistently as a PSO or PAM operator within the past five years;


(6) PSOs are responsible for obtaining NMFS' approval. NMFS may approve PSOs as conditional or unconditional. A conditionally-approved PSO may be one who has completed training in the last 5 years but has not yet attained field experience. An unconditionally approved PSO is one who has completed training within the last 5 years and attained the necessary experience (*i.e.,* demonstrate experience with monitoring for marine mammals at clearance and shutdown zone sizes similar to those produced during the respective activity). Lead PSOs must be unconditionally approved and have a minimum of 90 days in a northwestern Atlantic Ocean offshore environment performing the role (either visual or acoustic), with the conclusion of the most recent relevant experience not more than 18 months previous. A conditionally approved PSO must be paired with an unconditionally approved PSO;


(7) PSOs for HRG surveys may be unconditionally or conditionally approved. PSOs for foundation installation activities must be unconditionally approved;


(8) At least one on-duty PSO and PAM operator, where applicable, for each activity (*e.g.,* impact pile driving, vibratory pile driving, and HRG surveys) must be designated as the Lead PSO or Lead PAM operator;


(9) LOA Holder must submit previously approved PSOs and PAM operators to NMFS Office of Protected Resources for review and confirmation of their approval for specific roles at least 30 days prior to commencement of the activities requiring PSOs/PAM operators or 15 days prior to when new PSOs/PAM operators are required after activities have commenced;


(10) For prospective PSOs and PAM operators not previously approved, or for PSOs and PAM operators whose approval is not current, LOA Holder must submit resumes for approval at least 60 days prior to PSO and PAM operator use. Resumes must include information related to relevant education, experience, and training, including dates, duration, location, and description of prior PSO or PAM operator experience. Resumes must be accompanied by relevant documentation of successful completion of necessary training;


(11) PAM operators are responsible for obtaining NMFS approval. To be approved as a PAM operator, the person must meet the following qualifications: The PAM operator must have completed a PAM operator training course and demonstrate prior experience using PAM software, equipment, and real-time acoustic detection systems. They must demonstrate that they have prior experience independently analyzing archived and/or real-time PAM data to identify and classify baleen whale and other marine mammal vocalizations by species, including North Atlantic right whale and humpback whale vocalizations, and experience with deconflicting multiple species' vocalizations that are similar and/or received concurrently. PAM operators must be independent observers (*i.e.,* not construction personnel), trained to use relevant project-specific PAM software and equipment, and must also be able test software and hardware functionality prior to beginning real-time monitoring. The PAM operator must be able to identify and classify marine mammal acoustic detections by species in real-time (prioritizing North Atlantic right whales and noting other marine mammal vocalizations, when detected). At a minimum, for each acoustic detection, the PAM operator must be able to categorically determine whether a North Atlantic right whale is detected, possibly detected, or not detected, and notify the Lead PSO of any confirmed or possible detections, including baleen whale detections that cannot be identified to species. If the PAM software is capable of localization of sounds or deriving bearings and distance, the PAM operator must demonstrate experience using this technique. A Lead PAM operator must meet all of these requirements and have a minimum of 90 days in the specified role or sufficient alternative experience;


(12) PSOs may work as PAM operators and vice versa, pending NMFS-approval; however, they may only perform one role at any time and must not exceed work time restrictions, which must be tallied cumulatively; and


(13) All PSOs and PAM operators must complete a Permits and Environmental Compliance Plan training and a 2-day refresher session that must be held with the PSO provider and Project compliance representative(s) prior to the start of in-water project activities (*e.g.,* HRG survey, foundation installation, *etc.*).


(b) *General PSO and PAM operator requirements.* The following measures apply to PSOs and PAM operators and must be implemented by LOA Holder:


(1) PSOs must monitor for marine mammals prior to, during, and following impact pile driving and HRG surveys that use sub-bottom profilers (with specific monitoring durations and needs described in paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section, respectively). Monitoring must be done while free from distractions and in a consistent, systematic, and diligent manner;


(2) PAM operator(s) must acoustically monitor for marine mammals prior to, during, and following all pile driving activities. PAM operators may be located on a vessel or remotely on-shore but must have the appropriate equipment (*i.e.,* computer station equipped with a data collection software system available wherever they are stationed) and be in real-time communication with PSOs and transiting vessel captains. The PAM operator must monitor to and past the clearance zone for large whales;


(3) For foundation installation, PSOs must visually clear (*i.e.,* confirm no observations of marine mammals) the entire minimum visibility zone for a full 30 minutes immediately prior to commencing activities. For HRG surveys, which do not have a minimum visibility zone, the entire clearance zone must be visually cleared and as much of the Level B harassment zone as possible;


(4) All PSOs must be located at the best vantage point(s) on any platform, as determined by the Lead PSO, in order to obtain 360-degree visual coverage of the entire clearance and shutdown zones around the activity area, and as much of the Level B harassment zone as possible. The PAM operator(s) must assist PSOs in ensuring full coverage of the clearance and shutdown zones;


(5) All on-duty PSOs must remain in real-time contact with the on-duty PAM operator(s), PAM operators must immediately communicate all acoustic detections of marine mammals to PSOs, including any determination regarding species identification, distance, and bearing (where relevant) relative to the pile being driven and the degree of confidence (*e.g.,* possible, probable detection) in the determination. All on-duty PSOs and PAM operator(s) must remain in contact with the on-duty construction personnel responsible for implementing mitigations (*e.g.,* delay to pile driving) to ensure communication on marine mammal observations can easily, quickly, and consistently occur between all on-duty PSOs, PAM operator(s), and on-water project personnel;


(6) The PAM operator must inform the Lead PSO(s) on duty of animal detections approaching or within applicable ranges of interest to the activity occurring via the data collection software system (*i.e.,* Mysticetus or similar system) who must be responsible for requesting that the designated crewmember implement the necessary mitigation procedures (*i.e.,* delay);


(7) Any visual observations of marine mammals by any project personnel must be communicated immediately to on-duty PSOs and vessel captains associated with other project vessels to increase situational awareness;


(8) PSOs must use high magnification (25x) binoculars, standard handheld (7x) binoculars, and the naked eye to search continuously for marine mammals. During foundation installation, at least two PSOs on the pile driving vessel must be equipped with functional Big Eye binoculars (*e.g.,* 25 ร 150; 2.7 view angle; individual ocular focus; height control); these must be pedestal mounted on the deck at the best vantage point that provides for optimal sea surface observation and PSO safety. A minimum of three on-duty PSOs must be active on a dedicated PSO vessel. PAM operators must have the appropriate equipment (*i.e.,* a computer station equipped with a data collection software system available wherever they are stationed) in accordance with the NMFS-approved PAM Plan as described in ยง 217.344(c)(20);


(9) PSOs and PAM operators must not exceed 4 consecutive watch hours on duty at any time, must have a 2-hour (minimum) break between watches, and must not exceed a combined watch schedule of more than 12 hours in a 24-hour period. If the schedule includes PSOs and PAM operators on-duty for 2-hour shifts, a minimum 1-hour break between watches must be allowed;


(10) During periods of low visibility (*e.g.,* darkness, rain, fog, poor weather conditions, *etc.*), PSOs must use alternative technology (*e.g.,* infrared or thermal cameras) to monitor the clearance and shutdown zones as approved by NMFS; and


(11) PSOs must remain in real-time contact with the PAM operators and construction personnel responsible for implementing mitigation (*e.g.,* delay to pile driving) to ensure communication on marine mammal observations can easily, quickly, and consistently occur between all on-duty PSOs, PAM operator(s), and on-water project personnel


(c) *PSO and PAM operator requirements during WTG, OSS, and Met Tower foundation installation.* The following measures apply to PSOs and PAM operators during WTG, OSS, and Met tower foundation installation and must be implemented by LOA Holder:


(1) PSOs and PAM operator(s), using a NMFS-approved PAM system, must monitor for marine mammals 60 minutes prior to, during, and 30 minutes following all pile driving activities. If PSOs cannot visually monitor the minimum visibility zone prior to impact pile driving at all times using the equipment described in paragraphs (b)(6) and (7) of this section, pile driving operations must not commence or must shutdown if they are currently active;


(2) At least three on-duty PSOs must be stationed and observing from the activity platform during impact pile driving and at least three on-duty PSOs must be stationed on each dedicated PSO vessel. There must be a minimum of three PSO observation platforms during impact pile driving.

The report must include the time, date, and location of the incident; species identification (if known) or description of the animal(s) involved; vessel size and motor configuration (inboard, outboard, jet propulsion); vessel's speed leading up to and during the incident; vessel's course/heading and what operations were being conducted (if applicable); status of all sound sources in use; description of avoidance measures/requirements that were in place at the time of the strike and what additional measures were taken, if any, to avoid strike; environmental conditions (*e.g.,* wind speed and direction, Beaufort sea state, cloud cover, visibility) immediately preceding the strike; estimated size and length of animal that was struck; description of the behavior of the marine mammal immediately preceding and following the strike; if available, description of the presence and behavior of any other marine mammals immediately preceding the strike; estimated fate of the animal (*e.g.,* dead, injured but alive, injured and moving, blood or tissue observed in the water, status unknown, disappeared); and to the extent practicable, photographs or video footage of the animal(s). LOA Holder must immediately cease all on-water activities until the NMFS Office of Protected Resources is able to review the circumstances of the incident and determine what, if any, additional measures are appropriate to ensure compliance with the terms of the LOA. NMFS Office of Protected Resources may impose additional measures to minimize the likelihood of further prohibited take and ensure MMPA compliance. LOA Holder may not resume their activities until notified by NMFS Office of Protected Resources; and


(16) LOA Holder must report any lost gear associated with the fishery surveys to the NOAA GARFO Protected Resources Division (*nmfs.gar.incidental-take@noaa.gov*) as soon as possible or within 24 hours of the documented time of missing or lost gear. This report must include information on any markings on the gear and any efforts undertaken or planned to recover the gear.
