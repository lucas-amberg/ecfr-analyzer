# § 217.124   Mitigation requirements.

When conducting the activities identified in § 217.120(a), the mitigation measures contained in any LOA issued under §§ 216.106 of this chapter and 217.126 must be implemented. These mitigation measures shall include but are not limited to the following general conditions:


(a) All persons must slowly approach beaches for boat landings. Boat landings must avoid causing stampede and provide marine mammals with an opportunity to safely enter the water. Vessel strikes are prohibited.


(b) All persons must observe a site from a distance, using binoculars if necessary, to detect any marine mammals prior to approach to determine if mitigation is required (*i.e.,* if pinnipeds are present, researchers must approach with caution, walking slowly, quietly, and close to the ground to avoid surprising any hauled-out marine mammals and to reduce flushing/stampeding of individuals).


(c) All persons must avoid pinnipeds along access ways to sites by locating and taking a different access way. Researchers must keep a safe distance from and not approach any marine mammal while conducting research, unless it is absolutely necessary to flush a marine mammal in order to continue conducting research (*i.e.,* if a site cannot be accessed or sampled due to the presence of pinnipeds).


(d) All persons must avoid visits to sites when pups are present, if the number of takes that have been authorized are met, or if species for which authorization has not been granted are present.


(e) All persons must monitor for offshore predators and must not approach hauled out pinnipeds if great white sharks (*Carcharodon carcharias*) or killer whales (*Orcinus orca*) are observed to be present. If Point Blue and/or its designees see pinniped predators in the area, they must not disturb the pinnipeds until the lead biologist determines the area is free of predators based on best professional judgment.


(f) All persons must keep voices hushed and bodies low to the ground in the visual presence of pinnipeds.


(g) All persons must conduct seabird observations at North Landing on Southeast Farallon Island in an observation blind, shielded from the view of hauled out pinnipeds.


(h) All persons must crawl slowly to access seabird nest boxes on Año Nuevo Island if pinnipeds are within view.


(i) Researchers must coordinate research visits to intertidal areas of Southeast Farallon Island and coordinate research activities for Año Nuevo Island to minimize the number of trips to these areas.
