# § 218.67   Renewals and modifications of Letters of Authorization.

(a) An LOA issued under § 216.106 of this subchapter and § 218.66 for the activity identified in § 218.60(c) may be modified upon request by the applicant, consistent with paragraph (b) of this section, provided that any requested changes to the activity or to the mitigation, monitoring, or reporting measures (excluding changes made pursuant to the adaptive management provision in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) do not change the underlying findings made for the regulations in this subpart and do not result in more than a minor change in the total estimated number of takes (or distribution by species or years).


(b) An LOA issued under § 216.106 of this subchapter and § 218.66 may be modified by NMFS under the following circumstances:


(1) *Adaptive management.* After consulting with the USAF regarding the practicability of the modifications, NMFS may modify (including adding or removing measures) the existing mitigation, monitoring, or reporting measures if doing so creates a reasonable likelihood of more effectively accomplishing the goals of the mitigation and monitoring.


(i) Possible sources of data that could contribute to the decision to modify the mitigation, monitoring, or reporting measures in an LOA include:


(A) Results from USAF's annual monitoring report and annual exercise report from the previous year(s);


(B) Results from other marine mammal and/or sound research or studies;


(C) Results from specific stranding investigations; or


(D) Any information that reveals marine mammals may have been taken in a manner, extent, or number not authorized by the regulations in this subpart or subsequent LOAs.


(ii) If, through adaptive management, the modifications to the mitigation, monitoring, or reporting measures are substantial, NMFS will publish a notice of a new proposed LOA in the _Federal Register_ and solicit public comment.


(2) *Emergencies.* If NMFS determines that an emergency exists that poses a significant risk to the well-being of the species of marine mammals specified in LOAs issued pursuant to § 216.106 of this subchapter and § 218.66, an LOA may be modified without prior public notice or opportunity for public comment. Notice will be published in the _Federal Register_ within thirty days of the action.
