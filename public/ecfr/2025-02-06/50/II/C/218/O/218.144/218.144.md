# § 218.144   Mitigation requirements.

(a) When conducting the activities identified in § 218.140(c), the mitigation measures contained in any LOAs issued under §§ 216.106 of this chapter and 218.146 must be implemented. These mitigation measures include, but are not limited to:


(1) *Procedural mitigation.* Procedural mitigation is mitigation that the Navy must implement whenever and wherever an applicable training or testing activity takes place within the NWTT Study Area for each applicable activity category or stressor category and includes acoustic stressors (*i.e.,* active sonar, weapons firing noise), explosive stressors (*i.e.,* sonobuoys, torpedoes, medium-caliber and large-caliber projectiles, missiles, bombs, Mine Countermeasure and Neutralization activities, mine neutralization involving Navy divers), and physical disturbance and strike stressors (*i.e.,* vessel movement, towed in-water devices, small-, medium-, and large-caliber non-explosive practice munitions, non-explosive missiles, non-explosive bombs and mine shapes).


(i) *Environmental awareness and education.* Appropriate Navy personnel (including civilian personnel) involved in mitigation and training or testing activity reporting under the specified activities will complete the environmental compliance training modules identified in their career path training plan, as specified in the LOAs.


(ii) *Active sonar.* Active sonar includes low-frequency active sonar, mid-frequency active sonar, and high-frequency active sonar. For vessel-based active sonar activities, mitigation applies only to sources that are positively controlled and deployed from manned surface vessels (*e.g.,* sonar sources towed from manned surface platforms). For aircraft-based active sonar activities, mitigation applies only to sources that are positively controlled and deployed from manned aircraft that do not operate at high altitudes (*e.g.,* rotary-wing aircraft). Mitigation does not apply to active sonar sources deployed from unmanned aircraft or aircraft operating at high altitudes (*e.g.,* maritime patrol aircraft).


(A) *Number of Lookouts and observation platform for hull-mounted sources.* For hull-mounted sources, the Navy must have one Lookout for platforms with space or manning restrictions while underway (at the forward part of a small boat or ship) and platforms using active sonar while moored or at anchor (including pierside), and two Lookouts for platforms without space or manning restrictions while underway (at the forward part of the ship).


(B) *Number of Lookouts and observation platform for sources not hull-mounted.* For sources that are not hull-mounted, the Navy must have one Lookout on the ship or aircraft conducting the activity.


(C) *Prior to activity.* Prior to the initial start of the activity (*e.g.,* when maneuvering on station), Navy personnel must observe the mitigation zone for floating vegetation and marine mammals; if floating vegetation or a marine mammal is observed, Navy personnel must relocate or delay the start of active sonar transmission until the mitigation zone is clear of floating vegetation or until the conditions in paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(F) are met for marine mammals.


(D) *During activity for low-frequency active sonar at 200 decibels (dB) and hull-mounted mid-frequency active sonar.* During the activity, for low-frequency active sonar at 200 dB and hull-mounted mid-frequency active sonar, Navy personnel must observe the following mitigation zones for marine mammals.


(*1*) *Powerdowns for marine mammals.* Navy personnel must power down active sonar transmission by 6 dB if marine mammals are observed within 1,000 yard (yd) of the sonar source; Navy personnel must power down an additional 4 dB (10 dB total) if marine mammals are observed within 500 yd of the sonar source.


(*2*) *Shutdowns for marine mammals.* Navy personnel must cease transmission if cetaceans are observed within 200 yd of the sonar source in any location in the Study Area; Navy personnel must cease transmission if pinnipeds in the NWTT Offshore Area or Western Behm Canal are observed within 200 yd of the sonar source and cease transmission if pinnipeds in NWTT Inland Waters are observed within 100 yd of the sonar source (except if hauled out on, or in the water near, man-made structures and vessels).


(E) *During activity for low-frequency active sonar below 200 dB, mid-frequency active sonar not hull-mounted, and high-frequency sonar.* During the activity, for low-frequency active sonar below 200 dB, mid-frequency active sonar sources that are not hull-mounted, and high-frequency sonar, Navy personnel must observe the following mitigation zones for marine mammals. Navy personnel must cease transmission if cetaceans are observed within 200 yd of the sonar source in any location in the Study Area. Navy personnel must cease transmission if pinnipeds in the NWTT Offshore Area or Western Behm Canal are observed within 200 yd of the sonar source. Navy personnel must cease transmission if pinnipeds in NWTT Inland Waters are observed within 100 yd of the sonar source (except if hauled out on, or in the water near, man-made structures and vessels).


(F) Co*mmencement/recommencement conditions after marine mammal sighting before or during activity.* Navy personnel must allow a sighted marine mammal to leave the mitigation zone prior to the initial start of the activity (by delaying the start) or during the activity (by not recommencing or powering up active sonar transmission) until one of the following conditions has been met:


(*1*) *Observed exiting.* The animal is observed exiting the mitigation zone;


(*2*) *Thought to have exited.* The animal is thought to have exited the mitigation zone based on a determination of its course, speed, and movement relative to the sonar source;


(*3*) *Clear from additional sightings.* The mitigation zone has been clear from any additional sightings for 10 minutes (min) for aircraft-deployed sonar sources or 30 min for vessel-deployed sonar sources;


(*4*) *Sonar source transit.* For mobile activities, the active sonar source has transited a distance equal to double that of the mitigation zone size beyond the location of the last sighting; or


(*5*) *Bow-riding dolphins.* For activities using hull-mounted sonar, the Lookout concludes that dolphins are deliberately closing in on the ship to ride the ship's bow wave, and are therefore out of the main transmission axis of the sonar (and there are no other marine mammal sightings within the mitigation zone).

For safe navigation and to avoid interactions with large whales, the Navy must instruct vessels to remain vigilant to the presence of Southern Resident killer whales and gray whales that may be vulnerable to vessel strikes or potential impacts from training and testing activities. Platforms must use the information from the awareness notification messages to assist their visual observation of applicable mitigation zones during training and testing activities and to aid in the implementation of procedural mitigation.
