# ยง 221.55   What evidence is admissible at the hearing?

(a) *General.* (1) Subject to the provisions of ยง 221.42(b), the ALJ may admit any written, oral, documentary, or demonstrative evidence that is:


(i) Relevant, reliable, and probative; and


(ii) Not privileged or unduly repetitious or cumulative.


(2) The ALJ may exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the risk of undue prejudice, confusion of the issues, or delay.


(3) Hearsay evidence is admissible. The ALJ may consider the fact that evidence is hearsay when determining its probative value.


(4) The Federal Rules of Evidence do not directly apply to the hearing, but may be used as guidance by the ALJ and the parties in interpreting and applying the provisions of this section.


(b) *Objections.* Any party objecting to the admission or exclusion of evidence must concisely state the grounds. A ruling on every objection must appear in the record.
