# ยง 222.404   Observer program sampling.

(a) During the program design, NMFS would be guided by the following standards in the distribution and placement of observers among fisheries and vessels in a particular fishery:


(1) The requirements to obtain the best available scientific information;


(2) The requirement that assignment of observers is fair and equitable among fisheries and among vessels in a fishery;


(3) The requirement that no individual person or vessel, or group of persons or vessels, be subject to inappropriate, excessive observer coverage; and


(4) The need to minimize costs and avoid duplication, where practicable.


(b) Consistent with 16 U.S.C. 1881(b), vessels where the facilities for accommodating an observer or carrying out observer functions are so inadequate or unsafe (due to size or quality of equipment, for example) that the health or safety of the observer or the safe operation of the vessel would be jeopardized, would not be required to take observers under this rule.
