# § 226.202   Critical habitat for Steller sea lions.

(a) *Alaska rookeries, haulouts, and associated areas.* In Alaska, all major Steller sea lion rookeries identified in Table 1 and major haulouts identified in Table 2 and associated terrestrial, air, and aquatic zones. Critical habitat includes a terrestrial zone that extends 3,000 feet (0.9 km) landward from the baseline or base point of each major rookery and major haulout in Alaska. Critical habitat includes an air zone that extends 3,000 feet (0.9 km) above the terrestrial zone of each major rookery and major haulout in Alaska, measured vertically from sea level. Critical habitat includes an aquatic zone that extends 3,000 feet (0.9 km) seaward in State and Federally managed waters from the baseline or basepoint of each major rookery and major haulout in Alaska that is east of 144° W. longitude. Critical habitat includes an aquatic zone that extends 20 nm (37 km) seaward in State and Federally managed waters from the baseline or basepoint of each major rookery and major haulout in Alaska that is west of 144° W. longitude.


(b) *California and Oregon rookeries and associated areas.* In California and Oregon, all major Steller sea lion rookeries identified in Table 1 and associated air and aquatic zones. Critical habitat includes an air zone that extends 3,000 feet (0.9 km) above areas historically occupied by sea lions at each major rookery in California and Oregon, measured vertically from sea level. Critical habitat includes an aquatic zone that extends 3,000 feet (0.9 km) seaward in State and Federally managed waters from the baseline or basepoint of each major rookery in California and Oregon.


(c) *Three special aquatic foraging areas in Alaska.* Three special aquatic foraging areas in Alaska, including the Shelikof Strait area, the Bogoslof area, and the Seguam Pass area.


(1) Critical habitat includes the Shelikof Strait area in the Gulf of Alaska and consists of the area between the Alaska Peninsula and Tugidak, Sitkinak, Aiaktilik, Kodiak, Raspberry, Afognak and Shuyak Islands (connected by the shortest lines); bounded on the west by a line connecting Cape Kumlik (56°38″/157°27′ W) and the southwestern tip of Tugidak Island (56°24′ N/154°41′ W) and bounded in the east by a line connecting Cape Douglas (58°51′ N/153°15′ W) and the northernmost tip of Shuyak Island (58°37′ N/152°22′ W).


(2) Critical habitat includes the Bogoslof area in the Bering Sea shelf and consists of the area between 170°00′ W and 164°00′ W, south of straight lines connecting 55°00′ N/170°00′ W and 55°00′ N/168°00′ W; 55°30′ N/168°00′ W and 55°30′ N/166°00′ W; 56°00′ N/166°00′ W and 56°00′ N/164°00′ W and north of the Aleutian Islands and straight lines between the islands connecting the following coordinates in the order listed:


(3) Critical habitat includes the Seguam Pass area and consists of the area between 52°00′ N and 53°00′ N and between 173°30′ W and 172°30′ W.
