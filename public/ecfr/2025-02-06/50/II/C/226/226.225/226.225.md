# § 226.225   Critical habitat for the Gulf of Maine, New York Bight, Chesapeake Bay, Carolina, and South Atlantic distinct population segments (DPSs) of Atlantic Sturgeon.

Critical habitat is designated for the Gulf of Maine, New York Bight, Chesapeake Bay, Carolina, and South Atlantic DPSs of Atlantic sturgeon as described in paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section. The maps, clarified by the textual descriptions in paragraphs (d) through (h) of this section, are the definitive source for determining the critical habitat boundaries.


(a) *Critical habitat for the Gulf of Maine, New York Bight, and Chesapeake Bay DPSs of Atlantic sturgeon.* The physical features essential for the conservation of Atlantic sturgeon belonging to the Gulf of Maine, New York Bight, and Chesapeake Bay DPSs are those habitat components that support successful reproduction and recruitment. These are:


(1) Hard bottom substrate (*e.g.,* rock, cobble, gravel, limestone, boulder, etc.) in low salinity waters (*i.e.,* 0.0-0.5 parts per thousand range) for settlement of fertilized eggs, refuge, growth, and development of early life stages;


(2) Aquatic habitat with a gradual downstream salinity gradient of 0.5 up to as high as 30 parts per thousand and soft substrate (*e.g.,* sand, mud) between the river mouth and spawning sites for juvenile foraging and physiological development;


(3) Water of appropriate depth and absent physical barriers to passage (*e.g.,* locks, dams, thermal plumes, turbidity, sound, reservoirs, gear, etc.) between the river mouth and spawning sites necessary to support:


(i) Unimpeded movement of adults to and from spawning sites;


(ii) Seasonal and physiologically dependent movement of juvenile Atlantic sturgeon to appropriate salinity zones within the river estuary; and


(iii) Staging, resting, or holding of subadults or spawning condition adults. Water depths in main river channels must also be deep enough (*e.g.,* at least 1.2 meters) to ensure continuous flow in the main channel at all times when any sturgeon life stage would be in the river;


(4) Water, between the river mouth and spawning sites, especially in the bottom meter of the water column, with the temperature, salinity, and oxygen values that, combined, support:


(i) Spawning;


(ii) Annual and interannual adult, subadult, larval, and juvenile survival; and


(iii) Larval, juvenile, and subadult growth, development, and recruitment (*e.g.,* 13 to 26 °C for spawning habitat and no more than 30 °C for juvenile rearing habitat, and 6 milligrams per liter (mg/L) or greater dissolved oxygen for juvenile rearing habitat).


(5) Pursuant to ESA section 4(a)(3)(B)(i), critical habitat for the New York Bight and Chesapeake Bay DPSs of Atlantic sturgeon does not include the following areas owned or controlled by the Department of Defense, or designated for its use, that are subject to an integrated natural resource management plan prepared under section 101 of the Sikes Act (16 U.S.C. 670a), and for which we have determined that such plan provides a conservation benefit to the species, and its habitat, for which critical habitat is designated.


(i) The Department of the Army, U.S. Military Academy—West Point, NY;


(ii) The Department of the Air Force, Joint Base Langley—Eustis, VA;


(iii) The Department of the Navy, Marine Corps Base Quantico, VA;


(iv) The Department of the Navy, Naval Weapons Station Yorktown, VA; and,


(v) The Department of the Navy, Naval Support Facility Dahlgren, VA.


(6) Pursuant to ESA section 3(5)(A)(i), critical habitat for the Gulf of Maine, New York Bight, and Chesapeake Bay DPSs of Atlantic sturgeon does not include existing (already constructed), as of September 18, 2017, manmade structures that do not provide the physical features such as aids-to-navigation (ATONs), artificial reefs, boat ramps, docks, or pilings within the legal boundaries of designated critical habitat.


(b) *Critical habitat for the Carolina and South Atlantic DPSs of Atlantic sturgeon.* The physical features essential for the conservation of Atlantic sturgeon belonging to the Carolina and South Atlantic DPSs are those habitat components that support successful reproduction and recruitment. These are:


(1) Hard bottom substrate (*e.g.,* rock, cobble, gravel, limestone, boulder, etc.) in low salinity waters (*i.e.,* 0.0-0.5 parts per thousand range) for settlement of fertilized eggs and refuge, growth, and development of early life stages;


(2) Aquatic habitat inclusive of waters with a gradual downstream gradient of 0.5 up to as high as 30 parts per thousand and soft substrate (*e.g.,* sand, mud) between the river mouth and spawning sites for juvenile foraging and physiological development;


(3) Water of appropriate depth and absent physical barriers to passage (*e.g.,* locks, dams, thermal plumes, turbidity, sound, reservoirs, gear, etc.) between the river mouth and spawning sites necessary to support:


(i) Unimpeded movement of adults to and from spawning sites;


(ii) Seasonal and physiologically dependent movement of juvenile Atlantic sturgeon to appropriate salinity zones within the river estuary; and


(iii) Staging, resting, or holding of subadults or spawning condition adults. Water depths in main river channels must also be deep enough (at least 1.2 meters) to ensure continuous flow in the main channel at all times when any sturgeon life stage would be in the river;


(4) Water quality conditions, especially in the bottom meter of the water column, with temperature and oxygen values that support:


(i) Spawning;


(ii) Annual and inter-annual adult, subadult, larval, and juvenile survival; and


(iii) Larval, juvenile, and subadult growth, development, and recruitment. Appropriate temperature and oxygen values will vary interdependently, and depending on salinity in a particular habitat. For example, 6.0 mg/L dissolved oxygen or greater likely supports juvenile rearing habitat, whereas dissolved oxygen less than 5.0 mg/L for longer than 30 days is less likely to support rearing when water temperature is greater than 25 °C. In temperatures greater than 26 °C, dissolved oxygen greater than 4.3 mg/L is needed to protect survival and growth. Temperatures of 13 to 26 °C likely support spawning habitat.


(5) Pursuant to ESA section 4(a)(3)(B)(i), critical habitat for the Carolina DPS of Atlantic sturgeon does not include certain waters of the Cooper River, South Carolina, adjacent to Joint Base Charleston. These areas are described in 33 CFR 334.460(a)(8)(ii)-(iv), 33 CFR 334.460(a)(9), and 33 CFR 334.460(a)(10).


(6) Pursuant to ESA section 3(5)(A)(i), critical habitat for the Carolina and the South Atlantic DPSs of Atlantic sturgeon does not include existing (already constructed), as of September 18, 2017, manmade structures that do not provide the physical features such as aids-to-navigation (ATONs), artificial reefs, boat ramps, docks, or pilings within the legal boundaries of designated critical habitat.
