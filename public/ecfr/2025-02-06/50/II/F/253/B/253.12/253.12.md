# § 253.12   Credit application.

(a) *Applicant.* (1) An applicant must be a U.S. citizen and be eligible to document a vessel in the coastwise trade: and


(2) Only the legal title holder of project property, or its parent company (or the lessee of an appropriate long-term lease) may apply for a loan; and


(3) An applicant and the majority of its principals must generally have the ability, experience, resources, character, reputation, and other qualifications the Program deems necessary for successfully operating, utilizing, or carrying out the project and protecting the Program's interest; and


(4) Applicants should apply to the appropriate NMFS Regional Financial Services Branch to be considered.


(b) *Application fee.* An application fee of 0.5 percent of the dollar amount of an application is due when the application is formally accepted. Upon submission, 50 percent of the application fee, known as the “filing fee,” is non-refundable; the remainder, known as the “commitment fee,” may be refunded if the Program declines an application or an applicant withdraws its application before the Program issues an AIP letter, as described in § 253.13(e). The Program will not issue an AIP letter if any of the application fee remains unpaid. No portion of the application fee shall be refunded once the Program issues an AIP letter.


(c) *False statement.* A false statement on an application is grounds for denial or termination of funds, grounds for possible punishment by a fine or imprisonment as provided in 18 U.S.C. 1001 and an event of a security default.
