# § 253.20   Fees.

(a) *Application fee.* See §§ 253.10 and 253.12(b).


(b) *Guarantee fee.* For existing Guaranteed Loans, an annual guarantee fee will be due in advance and will be based on the guaranteed note's repayment provisions for the prospective year. The first annual guarantee fee is due at guarantee closing. Each subsequent guarantee fee is due and payable on the guarantee closing's anniversary date. Each is fully earned when due, and shall not subsequently be refunded for any reason.


(c) *Refinancing or assumption fee.* The Program will assess a fee of one quarter of one (1) percent of the note to be refinanced or assumed. This fee is due upon application for refinancing or assumption of a guaranteed or direct loan. Upon submission, the fee shall be non-refundable. The Program may waive a refinancing or assumption fee's payment when the refinancing or assumption's primary purpose will benefit the United States.


(d) *Where payable.* Fees are payable by check to “U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA.” Other than those collected at application or closing, fees are payable by mailing checks to the “U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service,” to such address as the Program may designate. To ensure proper crediting, each check should include the official case number the Program assigns.
