(c) If the original document and all copies have not been returned to the inspector(s) performing the appeal service, the appeal document shall be issued to the person(s) the inspector(s) considers necessary to prevent misuse of the superseded document.


(d) All provisions in this regulation concerning the use, issuance and disposition of inspection certificates shall apply to appeal inspection certificates, except that electronic copies of the appeal inspection certificates shall be furnished to all interested parties who received the superseded certificate.
