# § 260.32   Requirements for the provision of Inspection Services for Approved Establishments.

All establishments must remain in good standing in order to receive services per this Part.


(a) The determination as to the inspection effort required to adequately provide inspection service at any establishment will be made by NMFS. The person-hours required may vary at different establishments due to factors such as, but not limited to, size and complexity of operations, volume and variety of products produced, and adequacy of control systems and cooperation. The inspection effort requirement may be reevaluated when the contracting party or NMFS deems there is sufficient change in production, equipment and change of quality control input to warrant reevaluation. Inspectors will not be available to perform any of the employee or management duties; however, they will be available for consultation purposes. NMFS reserves the right to reassign inspectors as it deems necessary.


(b) Assessment of an establishment's good standing will be made by the Agency through systems, process, and product auditing and inspection activities, which are further specified in the SIP Manual.


(c) The Agency shall not be held responsible:


(1) For damages occurring through any act of commission or omission on the part of its inspectors when engaged in performing services; or


(2) For production errors, such as processing temperatures, length of process, or misbranding of products; or


(3) For failure to supply enough inspection effort during any period of service.


(d) Approved Establishments shall:


(1) Use, handle, process, store and distribute only raw materials and finished products that meet processing and sanitation statutory and regulatory requirements for food safety, wholesomeness and labeling;


(2) Adequately code each primary container and master case of products sold or otherwise distributed from a manufacturing, processing, packing, or repackaging activity to enable lot identification to facilitate, where necessary, the segregation of specific food lots that may have become contaminated or otherwise unfit for their intended use;


(3) Provide adequate office space in the designated establishment, if required by the Agency, and furnish suitable desks, office equipment, internet services access, laboratory facilities and equipment required to perform product verification and inspection, as prescribed by the Agency;


(4) Furnish and provide laundry service for coats, trousers, smocks, and towels used by inspectors during performance of duty in establishments if required by the Agency; and


(5) During all reasonable times, provide representatives of the Agency free and immediate access to the establishment under the applicant's control for the purpose of performing any and all inspection services.


(e) Retention tags:


(1) Any equipment such as, but not limited to, conveyors, tillers, sorters, choppers, and containers which fail to meet appropriate and adequate sanitation requirements will be identified by the inspector in an appropriate and conspicuous manner with the word “RETAINED.” Following such identification, the equipment shall not be used until the discrepancy has been resolved, the equipment re-inspected and approved by the inspector and the “RETAINED” identification removed by the inspector.


(2) Lot(s) of processed products that may be considered to be mislabeled and/or unwholesome by reason of contaminants, or which may otherwise be in such condition as to require further evaluation or testing to determine that the product is properly labeled and/or wholesome, will be identified by the inspector in an appropriate and conspicuous manner with the word “RETAINED.” Such lot(s) of product shall be held for re-inspection or testing. Final disposition of the lot(s) shall be determined by NMFS and the removal of the “RETAINED” identification shall be performed by the inspector.


(f) Termination of inspection services:


(1) The fishery products inspection service, including the issuance of inspection reports, shall be rendered from the date of the commencement specified in the contract and continue until suspended or terminated:


(i) by mutual consent;


(ii) by either party giving the other party 60 days' written notice specifying the date of suspension or termination;


(iii) by written notice by the Agency in the event the applicant does not meet financial obligations;


(iv) by written notice by the Agency, terminating service in the event the applicant fails to meet statutory and/or regulatory requirements, or in the event the applicant fails to comply with any provisions of the regulations contained in this part;


(v) by automatic termination in case of bankruptcy, closing out of business, or change in controlling ownership.


(2) In case the contracting party wishes to terminate the fishery products inspection service under the terms of paragraph (f)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section:


(i) the service must be continued until all unused containers, labels, and advertising material on hand or in possession of his supplier bearing official identification marks or reference to the fishery products inspection service have been used;


(ii) all unused containers, labels, and advertising material bearing official identification marks or reference to the fishery products inspection service must be destroyed;


(iii) official identification marks and all other reference to the fishery products inspection service on all unused containers, labels, advertising material must be obliterated; or


(iv) assurance satisfactory to NMFS must be furnished that all unused containers, labels, and advertising material bearing official identification marks or reference to the fishery products inspection service will not be used in violation of any of the provisions of the regulations in the part.


(3) In case the fishery products inspection service is terminated for cause by NMFS under the terms of paragraph (f)(1)(iii) or (iv) of this section, or in case of automatic termination under terms of paragraph (f)(1)(v) of this section, the contracting party must destroy all unused containers, labels, and advertising material on hand bearing official identification marks or reference to the fishery products inspection service or must obliterate official identification marks and all reference to the fishery products inspection service on said containers, labels and advertising material. After termination of the fishery products inspection service, NMFS may, at such time or times as it may determine to be necessary, during regular business hours, enter the establishment(s) or other facilities in order to ascertain that the containers, labels, and advertising material have been altered or disposed of in the manner provided herein, to the satisfaction of NMFS.
