(ii) By means of gear or methods not authorized by Fraser River Panel regulations, inseason orders, or other applicable Federal, state, or treaty Indian tribal law. 


(iii) In violation of any applicable area, season, species, zone, gear, or mesh size restriction. 


(b) It is unlawful for any person or fishing vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to—


(1) Remove the head of any sockeye or pink salmon caught in the Fraser River Panel Area (U.S.), or possess a salmon with the head removed, if that salmon has been marked by removal of the adipose fin to indicate that a coded wire tag has been implanted in the head of the fish.
