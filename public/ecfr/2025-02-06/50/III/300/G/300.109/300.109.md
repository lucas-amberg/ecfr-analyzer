(a) A new fishery, for purposes of this section, is a fishery that uses bottom trawls on the high seas of the Convention Area or a fishery for a species, using a particular method, in a statistical subarea or division for which:


(1) Information on distribution, abundance, demography, potential yield and stock identity from comprehensive research/surveys or exploratory fishing has not been submitted to CCAMLR;


(2) Catch and effort data have never been submitted to CCAMLR; or


(3) Catch and effort data from the two most recent seasons in which fishing occurred have not been submitted to CCAMLR.


(b) Persons intending to develop a new fishery shall notify the Assistant Administrator no later than April 1 for the fishing season that will commence on or after December 1 and shall not initiate the fishery pending NMFS and CCAMLR review or until a vessel permit has been used under this subpart.


(c) The notification shall be accompanied by a complete vessel permit application required under ยง 300.107 and information on:


(1) The nature of the proposed fishery, including target species, methods of fishing, proposed region and maximum catch levels proposed for the forthcoming season;


(2) Biological information on the target species from comprehensive research/survey cruises, such as distribution, abundance, demographic data and information on stock identity;


(3) Details of dependent and related species and the likelihood of them being affected by the proposed fishery;


(4) Information from other fisheries in the region or similar fisheries elsewhere that may assist in the evaluation of potential yield; and


(5) If the proposed fishery will be undertaken using bottom trawl gear, the known and anticipated impacts of this gear on vulnerable marine ecosystems, including benthos and benthic communities.
