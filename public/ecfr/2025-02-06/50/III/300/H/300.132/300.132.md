(a) *Berried lobsters.* A berried (egg-bearing) lobster in treaty waters may not be retained on board. A berried lobster must be returned immediately to the water unharmed. A berried lobster may not be stripped, scraped, shaved, clipped, or in any other manner molested to remove the eggs. 


(b) *Size limit.* The minimum size limit for possession of lobster in or from treaty waters is 5.5 inches (13.97 cm), tail length. Tail length means the measurement, with the tail in a straight, flat position, from the anterior upper edge of the first abdominal (tail) segment to the tip of the closed tail. A lobster smaller than the minimum size limit must be returned immediately to the water unharmed.
