(2) In accordance with the following identification requirements:


(i) A vessel must be marked with its international radio call sign (IRCS) or, if not assigned an IRCS, must be marked (in order of priority) with its Federal, state, or other documentation number appearing on its high seas fishing permit and, if a WCPFC Area Endorsement has been issued for the vessel under § 300.212, that documentation number must be preceded by the characters “USA” and a hyphen (that is, “USA-”);


(ii) The markings must be displayed at all times on the vessel's side or superstructure, port and starboard, as well as on a deck;

(x) The space between adjacent letters having sloping sides must not exceed h/8 nor be less than h/10;


(xi) The marks must be white on a black background, or black on a white background;
