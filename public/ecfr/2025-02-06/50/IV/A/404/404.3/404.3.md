*Commercial Bottomfishing* means commercial fishing for bottomfish species.


*Commercial passenger vessel* means a vessel that carries individuals who have paid for such carriage.


*Commercial pelagic trolling* means commercial fishing for pelagic species.


*Deserting* a vessel means:


(1) Leaving a vessel aground or adrift:


(i) Without notifying the Secretaries of the vessel going aground or adrift within 12 hours of its discovery and developing and presenting to the Secretaries a preliminary salvage plan within 24 hours of such notification;


(ii) After expressing or manifesting intention to not undertake or to cease salvage efforts; or


(iii) When the Secretaries are unable, after reasonable efforts, to reach the owner/operator within 12 hours of the vessel's condition being reported to authorities.


(2) Leaving a vessel at anchor when its condition creates potential for a grounding, discharge, or deposit and the owner/operator fails to secure the vessel in a timely manner.


*Ecological Reserve* means the areas of the Monument, identified in the Proclamation, consisting of contiguous, diverse habitats that provide natural spawning, nursery, and permanent residence areas for the replenishment and genetic protection of marine life, and also to protect and preserve natural assemblages of habitats and species within areas representing a broad diversity of resources and habitats found within the Monument. Specific coordinates for Ecological Reserves within the Monument are found in the Proclamation, and the Ecological Reserves consist of the areas within the geodetic lines connecting these coordinates. The Ecological Reserves are depicted on the map in appendix A to part 404.


*Ecological integrity* means a condition determined to be characteristic of an ecosystem that has the ability to maintain the function, structure, and abundance of natural biological communities, including rates of change in response to natural environmental variation.


*Fishing year* means the year beginning at 0001 local time on January 1 and ending at 2400 local time on December 31.


*IMO* means the International Maritime Organization.


*Introduced Species* means:


(1) A species (including, but not limited to, any of its biological matter capable of propagation) that is non-native to the ecosystem(s) protected by the Monument; or


(2) Any organism into which genetic matter from another species has been transferred in order that the host organism acquires the genetic traits of the transferred genes.


*Landing* means offloading fish from a fishing vessel or causing fish to be offloaded from a fishing vessel.


*Midway Atoll Special Management Area* means the area of the Monument surrounding Midway Atoll out to a distance of 12 nautical miles, established for the enhanced management, protection, and preservation of Monument wildlife and historical resources. The geographic coordinates of this area, which consists of the area within the geodetic lines connecting these coordinates, are found in the Proclamation. The Midway Atoll Special Management Area is depicted on the map in appendix A to part 404.


*Mobile transceiver unit* means a vessel monitoring system or VMS device, as described in appendix E to this part, installed on board a vessel that is used for vessel monitoring and transmitting the vessel's position as required by this part.


*Monument* means the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument.


*Native Hawaiian Practices* means cultural activities conducted for the purposes of perpetuating traditional knowledge, caring for and protecting the environment and strengthening cultural and spiritual connections to the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands that have demonstrable benefits to the Native Hawaiian community. This may include, but is not limited to, the non-commercial use of Monument resources for direct personal consumption while in the Monument.


*Ocean-based ecotourism* means a class of fee-for-service activities that involves visiting the Monument for study, enjoyment, or volunteer assistance for purposes of conservation and management.


*Office for Law Enforcement (OLE)* refers to NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service, Office for Law Enforcement.


*Pelagic Species* means Pacific Pelagic Management Unit Species as defined at 50 CFR 665.12.


*Pono* means appropriate, correct, and deemed necessary by traditional standards in the Hawaiian culture.


*Proclamation* means Presidential Proclamation 8031, dated June 15, 2006 (71 FR 36443).


*Recreational activity* means an activity conducted for personal enjoyment that does not result in the extraction of Monument resources and that does not involve a fee-for-service transaction. This includes, but is not limited to, wildlife viewing, SCUBA diving, snorkeling, and boating.


*Reporting area* means the area within the coordinates set forth in appendix D.


*Secretaries* means the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior or their designees.


*Special Preservation Area (SPA)* means discrete, biologically important areas of the Monument, identified in the Proclamation, within which uses are subject to conditions, restrictions, and prohibitions, including but not limited to access restrictions. SPAs are used to avoid concentrations of uses that could result in declines in species populations or habitat, to reduce conflicts between uses, to protect areas that are critical for sustaining important marine species or habitats, or to provide opportunities for scientific research. Specific coordinates for Special Preservation Areas within the Monument are found in the Proclamation, and the Special Preservation Areas consist of the areas within the geodetic lines connecting these coordinates. The Special Preservation Areas are depicted on the map in appendix A to part 404.


*Special ocean use* means an activity or use of the Monument that is engaged in to generate revenue or profits for one or more of the persons associated with the activity or use, and does not destroy, cause the loss of, or injure Monument resources. This includes ocean-based ecotourism and other activities such as educational and research activities that are engaged in to generate revenue, but does not include commercial fishing for bottomfish or pelagic species conducted pursuant to a valid permit issued by NOAA.


*Stowed and not available for immediate use* means not readily accessible for immediate use, *e.g.,* by being securely covered and lashed to a deck or bulkhead, tied down, unbaited, unloaded, or partially disassembled (such as spear shafts being kept separate from spear guns).
