# ยง 424.11   Factors for listing, delisting, or reclassifying species.

(a) Any species or taxonomic group of species (e.g., genus, subgenus) as defined in ยง 424.02 is eligible for listing under the Act. A taxon of higher rank than species may be listed only if all included species are individually found to be endangered or threatened. In determining whether a particular taxon or population is a species for the purposes of the Act, the Secretary shall rely on standard taxonomic distinctions and the biological expertise of the Department and the scientific community concerning the relevant taxonomic group.




(b) The Secretary shall make any determination required by paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section solely on the basis of the best available scientific and commercial information regarding a species' status without reference to possible economic or other impacts of such determination.








(c) A species shall be listed or reclassified if the Secretary determines, on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available after conducting a review of the species' status, that the species meets the definition of an endangered species or a threatened species because of any one or a combination of the following factors:


(1) The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range;


(2) Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes;


(3) Disease or predation;


(4) The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or


(5) Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.


(d) In determining whether a species is a threatened species, the Services must analyze whether the species is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future. The foreseeable future extends as far into the future as the Services can make reasonably reliable predictions about the threats to the species and the species' responses to those threats. The Services will describe the foreseeable future on a case-by-case basis, using the best available data and taking into account considerations such as the species' life-history characteristics, threat-projection timeframes, and environmental variability. The Services need not identify the foreseeable future in terms of a specific period of time.


(e) Species will be delisted if the Secretary determines, based on consideration of the factors and standards set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, that the best scientific and commercial data available substantiate that:


(1) The species is extinct;


(2) The species has recovered to the point at which it no longer meets the definition of an endangered species or a threatened species;


(3) New information that has become available since the original listing decision shows the listed entity does not meet the definition of an endangered species or a threatened species; or


(4) New information that has become available since the original listing decision shows the listed entity does not meet the definition of a species.




(f) The fact that a species of fish, wildlife, or plant is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (see part 23 of this title) or a similar international agreement on such species, or has been identified as requiring protection from unrestricted commerce by any foreign nation, or to be in danger of extinction or likely to become so within the foreseeable future by any State agency or by any agency of a foreign nation that is responsible for the conservation of fish, wildlife, or plants, may constitute evidence that the species is endangered or threatened. The weight given such evidence will vary depending on the international agreement in question, the criteria pursuant to which the species is eligible for protection under such authorities, and the degree of protection afforded the species. The Secretary shall give consideration to any species protected under such an international agreement, or by any State or foreign nation, to determine whether the species is endangered or threatened.


(g) The Secretary shall take into account, in making determinations under paragraph (c) or (e) of this section, those efforts, if any, being made by any State or foreign nation, or any political subdivision of a State or foreign nation, to protect such species, whether by predator control, protection of habitat and food supply, or other conservation practices, within any area under its jurisdiction, or on the high seas.
