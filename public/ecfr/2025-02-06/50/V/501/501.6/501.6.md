# ยง 501.6   Requests for correction or amendment of a record.

(a) Any individual may request the correction or amendment of a record pertaining to him or her in writing addressed to the Privacy Officer at the Commission offices. Verification of identity required for such requests shall be the same as that specified in ยง 501.4 of this part with respect to requests for access. Records sought to be amended must be identified with as much specificity as is practicable under the circumstances of the request, and at a minimum, should refer to the system name designated in the Notice of System Records published in the _Federal Register,_ the type of record in which the information thought to be improperly maintained or incorrect is contained, and the precise information that is the subject of the request (for example, system name, description of record, paragraph, sentence, line, words). Assistance in identifying a record, and in otherwise preparing a request, may be obtained by contacting the Privacy Officer at the Commission offices. 


(b) A request should, in addition to identifying the individual and the record sought to be amended or corrected, include: 


(1) The specific wording or other information to be deleted, if any; 


(2) The specific wording or other information to be inserted, if any, and the exact place in the record at which it is to be inserted, and, 


(3) A statement of the basis for the requested amendment or correction (e.g. that the record is inaccurate, unnecessary, irrelevant, untimely, or incomplete), together with supporting documents, if any, which substantiate the statement.
