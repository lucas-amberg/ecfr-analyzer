# ยง 600.1005   Content of a request for a subsidized program.

A request for a subsidized program shall: 


(a) Specify the reduction fishery. 


(b) Project the amount of the reduction and specify what a reduction of that amount achieves in the reduction fishery. 


(c) Project the reduction cost, the amount of reduction cost to be funded by Federal appropriations, and the amount, if any, to be funded by other sources. 


(d) Project the availability of Federal appropriations or other funding, if any, that completion of the program requires, including the time at which funding from each source will be available and how that relates to the time at which elements of the reduction process are projected to occur. 


(e) List the names and addresses of record of all fishing permit or fishing vessel owners who are currently authorized to harvest fish from the reduction fishery, excluding those whose authority is limited to incidentally harvesting fish from the reduction fishery during directed fishing for fish not in the reduction fishery. The list shall be based on the best information available to the requester, including any information that NMFS may supply to the requester, and take into account any limitation by type of fishing gear operated, size of fishing vessel operated, geographic area of operation, or other factor that the proposed program involves. 


(f) Specify the aggregate total allowable catch in the reduction fishery during each of the preceding 5 years and the aggregate portion of such catch harvested by the parties listed under paragraph (e) of this section. 


(g) Include a preliminary development plan that: 


(1) Specifies a detailed reduction methodology that accomplishes the maximum sustained reduction in the reduction fishery's fishing capacity at the least cost and in a minimum period of time, and otherwise achieves the program result that the requester specifies under paragraph (b) of this section. The methodology shall: 


(i) Be sufficiently detailed to enable NMFS to prepare a final development plan to serve as the basis for NMFS to readily design, propose, and adopt a timely and reliable implementation plan and propose and issue timely and reliable implementation regulations, and 


(ii) Include: 


(A) The contents and terms of invitations to bid, 


(B) Eligible bidders, 


(C) The type of information that bidders shall supply, 


(D) The criteria for accepting or rejecting bids, and 


(E) The terms of bid acceptances; 


(2) Specifies the criteria for determining the types and numbers of fishing permits or fishing permits and fishing vessels that are eligible for reduction under the program. The criteria shall take into account: 


(i) The characteristics of the fishery, 


(ii) Whether the program is limited to a particular gear type within the reduction fishery, or is otherwise limited by size of fishing vessel operated, geographic area of operation, or other factor, 


(iii) Whether the program is limited to fishing permits or involves both fishing permits and fishing vessels, 


(iv) The reduction amendment required, 


(v) The needs of fishing communities, and 


(vi) The need to minimize the program's reduction cost; and 


(3) Demonstrates the program's cost effectiveness. 


(h) Demonstrate how the program meets, or will meet after an appropriate reduction amendment, the requirements in ยง 600.1002(a). 


(i) Demonstrate how the CFMP meets, or will meet after an appropriate reduction amendment, the requirements in ยง 600.1002(b)(1) and (2). 


(j) Specify any other information or guidance that assists NMFS in preparing a final development plan and a proposed implementation plan and proposed implementation regulations. 


(k) Include the requester's statement of belief that the program constitutes a reasonably realistic and practical prospect for successfully completing a program in accordance with this subpart.
