# ยง 600.1007   Reduction amendments.

(a) Each reduction amendment may contain provisions that are either dependent upon or independent of a program. Each provision of a reduction amendment is a dependent provision unless the amendment expressly designates the provision as independent. 


(b) Independent provisions are effective without regard to any subsequent program actions. 


(c) Dependent provisions are initially effective for the sole limited purpose of enabling initiation and completion of the pre-reduction processing stage of a program. 


(d) All dependent provisions of a reduction amendment for a financed program are fully in force and effect for all other purposes only when NMFS either:


(1) For bidding results that conform to the fishing capacity reduction specifications and are not subject to any other condition, notifies bidders, under ยง 600.1009(e)(3), that reduction contracts then exist between the bidders and the United States; or 


(2) For bidding results that do not conform to the fishing capacity reduction specifications or are subject to any other condition, notifies bidders whose bids NMFS had conditionally accepted, under ยง 600.1010 (d)(8)(iii), that the condition pertaining to the reduction contracts between them and the United States is fulfilled. 


(e) If NMFS does not, in accordance with this subpart and any special provisions in the implementation regulations, subsequently make all reduction payments that circumstances, in NMFS' judgment, reasonably permit NMFS to make and, thus, complete a program, no dependent provisions shall then have any further force or effect for any purpose and all final regulations involving such dependent provisions shall then be repealed.
