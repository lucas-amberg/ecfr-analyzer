(12) Any relevant post-referendum reduction procedures other than those in the implementation regulations or this subpart. 


(c) NMFS will base each implementation plan and implementation regulations for a subsidized program on the final development plan. The implementation plan will describe in detail all relevant aspects of implementing the program, including: 


(1) The reduction fishery; 


(2) The reduction methodology; 


(3) The maximum reduction cost; 


(4) The reduction-cost funding, if any, other than Federal appropriations; 


(5) The criteria for determining the types and number of fishing permits or fishing permits and fishing vessels eligible to participate in the program; 


(6) The invitation to bid and bidding procedures; 


(7) The criteria for determining bid acceptance; and 


(8) Any relevant post-bidding program procedures other than those in the implementation regulations or this subpart. 


(d) The implementation regulations will: 


(1) Specify, for invitations to bid, bids, and reduction contracts under ยง 600.1009: 


(i) Bidder eligibility, 


(ii) Bid submission requirements and procedures, 


(iii) A bid opening date, before which a bidder may not bid, and a bid closing date, after which a bidder may not bid,

(v) The manner of bid submission and the information each bidder shall supply for NMFS to deem a bid responsive, 


(vi) The conditions under which NMFS will accept or reject a bid, 


(vii) The manner in which NMFS will accept or reject a bid, and

(ii) Prospective fee rate determinations, and 


(iii) Any other aspect of fee payment, collection, deposit, disbursement, accounting, record keeping, and/or reporting. 


(e) NMFS will issue final implementation regulations and adopt a final implementation plan within 45 days of the close of the public-comment period. 


(f) NMFS may repeal the final implementation regulations for any program if: 


(1) For a financed program, the bidding results do not conform to the fishing capacity reduction specifications or a post-bidding referendum does not subsequently approve an industry fee system based on the bidding results; 


(2) For a subsidized program, NMFS does not accept bids; and 


(3) For either a financed program or a subsidized program, if NMFS is unable to make all reduction payments due to a material adverse change.
