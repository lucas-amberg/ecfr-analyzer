(g) *Repayment term.* For the purpose of determining fee rates, the reduction loan's repayment term shall be 30 years from March 1, 2004, but each fee shall continue for as long as necessary to fully repay each subamount.


(h) *Reduction loan.* The reduction loan shall be subject to the provisions of § 600.1012 of subpart L, except that:


(1) The borrower's obligation to repay the reduction loan shall be discharged by fish sellers in the reduction fishery and in each of the fee-share fisheries paying the fee applicable to each such fishery's subamount in accordance with § 600.1013 of subpart L, and


(2) Fish buyers in the reduction fishery and in each of the fee-share fisheries shall be obligated to collect the fee applicable to each such fishery's subamount in accordance with § 600.1013 of this subpart.


(i) *Fee collection, deposits, disbursements, records, and reports.* Fish buyers in the reduction fishery and in each of the fee share fisheries shall deposit and disburse, as well as keep records for and submit reports about, the fees applicable to each such fishery in accordance with § 600.1014 of this subpart, except that:


(1) *Deposit accounts.* Each fish buyer that this section requires to collect a fee shall maintain an account at a federally insured financial institution for the purpose of depositing collected fee revenue and disbursing the deposit principal directly to NMFS in accordance with paragraph (i)(3) of this section. The fish buyer may use this account for other operational purposes as well, but the fish buyer shall ensure that the account separately accounts for all deposit principal collected from the reduction fishery and from each of the six fee-share fisheries. The fish buyer shall separately account for all fee collections as follows:


(i) All fee collections from the reduction fishery shall be accounted for in a reduction fishery subaccount,


(ii) All fee collections from the California pink shrimp fee-share fishery shall be accounted for in a California shrimp fee-share fishery subaccount,


(iii) All fee collections from the California coastal Dungeness crab fishery shall be accounted for in a California crab fee-share fishery subaccount,


(iv) All fee collections from the Oregon pink shrimp fee-share fishery shall be accounted for in an Oregon shrimp fee-share fishery subaccount,


(v) All fee collections from the Oregon coastal Dungeness crab fee-share fishery shall be accounted for in an Oregon crab fee-share fishery subaccount,

(vii) All fee collections from the Washington coastal Dungeness crab fishery shall be accounted for in a Washington crab fee-share fishery subaccount;


(2) *Fee collection deposits.* Each fish buyer, no less frequently than at the end of each month, shall deposit, in the deposit account established under paragraph (i)(1) of this section, all collected fee revenue not previously deposited that the fish buyer collects through a date not more than two calendar days before the date of deposit. The deposit principal may not be pledged, assigned, or used for any purpose other than aggregating collected fee revenue for disbursement to the fund in accordance with paragraph (i)(3) of this section. The fish buyer is entitled, at any time, to withdraw interest (if any) on the deposit principal, but never the deposit fee principal itself, for the fish buyer's own use and purposes;


(3) *Deposit principal disbursement.* Not later than the 14th calendar day after the last calendar day of each month, or more frequently if the amount in the account exceeds the account limit for insurance purposes, the fish buyer shall disburse to NMFS the full deposit principal then in the deposit account, provided that the deposit principal then totals $100 or more. If the deposit principal then totals less than $100, the fish buyer need not disburse the deposit principal until either the next month during which the deposit principal then totals $100 or more, or not later than the 14th calendar day after the last calendar day of any year in which the deposit principal has not since the last required disbursement totaled $100 or more, whichever comes first. The fish buyer shall disburse deposit principal by check made payable to the groundfish program's fund subaccount. The fish buyer shall mail each such check to the groundfish program's fund subaccount lockbox that NMFS establishes for the receipt of groundfish program disbursements. Each disbursement shall be accompanied by the fish buyer's fee collection report completed in the manner and form which NMFS specifies. NMFS will, before fee payment and collection begins, specify the groundfish program's fund subaccount lockbox and the manner and form of fee collection report. NMFS will do this by means of the notification in § 600.1013(d) of subpart L. NMFS' fee collection report instructions will include provisions for the fish buyer to specify the amount of each disbursement which was disbursed from the reduction fishery subaccount and/or from each of the six fee-share fishery subaccounts;


(4) *Records maintenance.* Each fish buyer shall maintain, in a secure and orderly manner for a period of at least 3 years from the date of each transaction involved, at least the following information:


(i) For all deliveries of fee fish that the fish buyer buys from each fish seller:


(A) The date of delivery,


(B) The fish seller's identity,


(C) The weight, number, or volume of each species of fee fish delivered,


(D) Information sufficient to specifically identify the fishing vessel which delivered the fee fish,


(E) The delivery value of each species of fee fish,


(F) The net delivery value of each species of fee fish,


(G) The identity of the payor to whom the net delivery value is paid, if different than the fish seller,


(H) The date the net delivery value was paid,


(I) The total fee amount collected as a result of all fee fish, and


(J) The total fee amount collected as a result of all fee fish from the reduction fishery and/or all fee fish from each of the six fee-share fisheries; and


(ii) For all collected fee deposits to, and disbursements of deposit principal from, the deposit account include:


(A) The date of each deposit,


(B) The total amount deposited,


(C) The total amount deposited in the reduction fishery subaccount and/or in each of the six fee-share fishery subaccounts,


(D) The date of each disbursement to the Fund's lockbox,


(E) The total amount disbursed,


(F) The total amount disbursed from the reduction fishery subaccount and/or from each of the six fee-share fishery subaccounts, and


(G) The dates and amounts of disbursements to the fish buyer, or other parties, of interest earned on deposits; and


(5) *Annual report.* No fish buyer needs to submit an annual report about fee fish collection activities unless, during the course of an audit under § 600.1014(g), NMFS requires a fish buyer to submit such a report or reports.


(j) Other provisions. The reduction loan is, in all other respects, subject to the provisions of § 600.1012 through applicable portions of § 600.1017, except § 600.1014(e).
