# ยง 600.1507   Communications security.

Communications between an EMTU/EMTU-C and MCS must be secure from tampering or interception, including the reading of passwords and data. The EMTU/EMTU-C and MCS must have mechanisms to prevent to the extent possible:


(a) Sniffing and/or interception during transmission from the EMTU/EMTU-C to MCS.


(b) Spoofing.


(c) False position reports sent from an EMTU/EMTU-C.


(d) Modification of EMTU/EMTU-C identification.


(e) Interference with Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) or other safety/distress functions.


(f) Introduction of malware, spyware, keyloggers, or other software that may corrupt, disturb, or disrupt messages, transmission, and the VMS system.


(g) The EMTU/EMTU-C terminal from communicating with, influencing, or interfering with the Global Positioning System antenna or its functionality, position reports, or sending of position reports. The position reports must not be altered, corrupted, degraded, or at all affected by the operation of the terminal or any of its peripherals or installed-software.


(h) VMS data must be encrypted and sent securely through all associated cellular, satellite, and internet communication pathways and channels.
