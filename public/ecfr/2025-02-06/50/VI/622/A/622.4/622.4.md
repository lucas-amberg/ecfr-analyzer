# § 622.4   Permits and fees—general.

This section contains general information about procedures related to permits. See also §§ 622.70 and 622.220 regarding certain permit procedures unique to coral permits in the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic, respectively. See subpart F of this part for permit requirements related to aquaculture of species other than live rock. Permit requirements for specific fisheries, as applicable, are contained in the permit sections within subparts B through U of this part.


(a) *Applications for permits.* Application forms for all permits are available from the RA. Completed application forms and all required supporting documents must be submitted to the RA at least 30 days prior to the date on which the applicant desires to have the permit made effective. All vessel permits are mailed to owners, whether the applicant is an owner or an operator.


(1) *Vessel permits.* (i) The application for a commercial vessel permit, other than for wreckfish, or for a charter vessel/headboat permit must be submitted by the owner (in the case of a corporation, an officer or shareholder; in the case of a partnership, a general partner) or operator of the vessel. A commercial vessel permit that is issued based on the earned income qualification of an operator is valid only when that person is the operator of the vessel. The applicant for a commercial vessel permit for wreckfish must be a wreckfish shareholder.


(ii) An applicant must provide the following:


(A) A copy of the vessel's valid USCG certificate of documentation or, if not documented, a copy of its valid state registration certificate.


(B) Vessel name and official number.


(C) Name, address, telephone number, and other identifying information of the vessel owner and of the applicant, if other than the owner.


(D) Any other information concerning the vessel, gear characteristics, principal fisheries engaged in, or fishing areas, as specified on the application form.


(E) Any other information that may be necessary for the issuance or administration of the permit, as specified on the application form.


(F) If applying for a commercial vessel permit, documentation, as specified in the instructions accompanying each application form, showing that applicable eligibility requirements of this part have been met.


(G) If a sea bass pot will be used, the number, dimensions, and estimated cubic volume of the pots that will be used and the applicant's desired color code for use in identifying his or her vessel and buoys (white is not an acceptable color code).


(2) *Operator permits.* An applicant for an operator permit must provide the following:


(i) Name, address, telephone number, and other identifying information specified on the application.


(ii) Two recent (no more than 1-yr old), color, passport-size photographs.


(iii) Any other information that may be necessary for the issuance or administration of the permit, as specified on the application form.


(3) *Dealer permits.* (i) The application for a dealer permit must be submitted by the owner (in the case of a corporation, an officer or shareholder; in the case of a partnership, a general partner).


(ii) An applicant must provide the following:


(A) A copy of each state wholesaler's license held by the dealer.


(B) Name, address, telephone number, date the business was formed, and other identifying information of the business.


(C) The address of each physical facility at a fixed location where the business receives fish.


(D) Name, address, telephone number, other identifying information, and official capacity in the business of the applicant.


(E) Any other information that may be necessary for the issuance or administration of the permit, as specified on the application form.


(b) *Change in application information.* The owner or operator of a vessel with a permit, a person with a coral permit, a person with an operator permit, or a dealer with a permit must notify the RA within 30 days after any change in the application information specified in paragraph (a) of this section or in § 622.70(b), § 622.220(b), or § 622.400(b). The permit is void if any change in the information is not reported within 30 days.


(c) *Fees.* Unless specified otherwise, a fee is charged for each application for a permit, license, or endorsement submitted under this part, for each request for transfer or replacement of such permit, license, or endorsement, and for each sea bass pot identification tag required under § 622.177(a)(1). The amount of each fee is calculated in accordance with the procedures of the NOAA Finance Handbook, available from the RA, for determining the administrative costs of each special product or service. The fee may not exceed such costs and is specified with each application form. The appropriate fee must accompany each application, request for transfer or replacement, or request for sea bass pot identification tags.


(d) *Initial issuance.* (1) The RA will issue an initial permit at any time to an applicant if the application is complete and the specific requirements for the requested permit have been met. An application is complete when all requested forms, information, and documentation have been received.


(2) Upon receipt of an incomplete application, the RA will notify the applicant of the deficiency. If the applicant fails to correct the deficiency within 30 days of the date of the RA's letter of notification, the application will be considered abandoned.


(e) *Duration.* A permit remains valid for the period specified on it unless it is revoked, suspended, or modified pursuant to subpart D of 15 CFR part 904 or, in the case of a vessel or dealer permit, the vessel or dealership is sold.


(f) *Transfer*—(1) *Vessel permits, licenses, and endorsements and dealer permits.* A vessel permit, license, or endorsement or a dealer permit or endorsement issued under this part is not transferable or assignable, except as provided in the permits sections within subparts B through U of this part, where applicable. A person who acquires a vessel or dealership who desires to conduct activities for which a permit, license, or endorsement is required must apply for a permit, license, or endorsement in accordance with the provisions of this section and other applicable sections of this part. If the acquired vessel or dealership is currently permitted, the application must be accompanied by the original permit, and a copy of a signed bill of sale or equivalent acquisition papers. In those cases where a permit, license, or endorsement is transferable, the seller must sign the back of the permit, license, or endorsement and have the signed transfer document notarized.


(2) *Operator permits.* An operator permit is not transferable.


(g) *Renewal*—(1) *Vessel permits, licenses, and endorsements, and dealer permits.* Unless specified otherwise, a vessel or dealer permit holder who has been issued a permit, license, or endorsement under this part must renew such permit, license, or endorsement on an annual basis. The RA will notify a vessel or dealer permit holder whose permit, license, or endorsement is expiring approximately 2 months prior to the expiration date. A vessel or dealer permit holder who does not receive a notification is still required to submit an application form as specified below. The applicant must submit a completed renewal application form and all required supporting documents to the RA prior to the applicable deadline for renewal of the permit, license, or endorsement, and at least 30 calendar days prior to the date on which the applicant desires to have the permit made effective. Application forms and instructions for renewal are available online at *https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/southeast/resources-fishing/permits-applications-and-forms-southeast* or from the RA (Southeast Permits Office) at 1-877-376-4877, Monday through Friday between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., eastern time. If the RA receives an incomplete application, the RA will notify the applicant of the deficiency. If the applicant fails to correct the deficiency within 30 calendar days of the notification date by the RA, the application will be considered abandoned. A permit, license, or endorsement that is not renewed within the applicable deadline will not be reissued.


(2) *Operator permits.* An operator permit required by this part 622 is issued for a period not longer than 3 years. A permit not renewed immediately upon its expiration would expire at the end of the operator's birth month that is between 2 and 3 years after issuance. For renewal, a new application must be submitted in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.


(h) *Display.* A vessel permit, license, or endorsement issued under this part 622 must be carried on board the vessel. A dealer permit issued under this part 622, or a copy thereof, must be available on the dealer's premises. In addition, a copy of the dealer's permit must accompany each vehicle that is used to pick up from a fishing vessel fish harvested from the EEZ. A Gulf IFQ dealer endorsement must accompany each vehicle that is used to pick up Gulf IFQ red snapper and/or Gulf IFQ groupers and tilefishes. The operator of a vessel must present the vessel permit, license, or endorsement for inspection upon the request of an authorized officer. A dealer or a vehicle operator must present the permit or a copy for inspection upon the request of an authorized officer. An operator of a vessel in a fishery in which an operator permit is required must present his/her operator permit and one other form of personal identification that includes a picture (driver's license, passport, etc.) for inspection upon the request of an authorized officer.


(i) *Sanctions and denials.* (1) A permit, license, or endorsement issued pursuant to this part 622 may be revoked, suspended, or modified, and a permit, license, or endorsement application may be denied, in accordance with the procedures governing enforcement-related permit sanctions and denials found at subpart D of 15 CFR part 904.


(2) A person whose operator permit is suspended, revoked, or modified may not be aboard any fishing vessel subject to Federal fishing regulations in any capacity, if so sanctioned by NOAA, while the vessel is at sea or offloading. The vessel's owner and operator are responsible for compliance with this measure. A list of operators whose permits are revoked or suspended may be obtained from the RA.


(j) *Alteration.* A permit, license, or endorsement that is altered, erased, or mutilated is invalid.


(k) *Replacement.* A replacement permit, license, or endorsement may be issued. An application for a replacement permit, license, or endorsement is not considered a new application. An application for a replacement operator permit must include two new photographs, as specified in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
