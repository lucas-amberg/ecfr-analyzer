# Appendix D to Part 622â€”Specifications for Certified BRDs


A. *Extended Funnel.*

1. *Description.* The extended funnel BRD consists of an extension with large-mesh webbing in the center (the large-mesh escape section) and small-mesh webbing on each end held open by a semi-rigid hoop. A funnel of small-mesh webbing is placed inside the extension to form a passage for shrimp to the cod end. It also creates an area of reduced water flow to allow for fish escapement through the large mesh. One side of the funnel is extended vertically to form a lead panel and area of reduced water flow. There are two sizes of extended funnel BRDs, a standard size and an inshore size for small trawls.


2. *Minimum Construction and Installation Requirements for Standard Size.*

(a) *Extension Material.* The small-mesh sections used on both sides of the large-mesh escape section are constructed of 1
5/8 inch (4.13 cm), No. 30 stretched mesh, nylon webbing. The front section is 120 meshes around by 6
1/2 meshes deep. The back section is 120 meshes around by 23 meshes deep.


(b) *Large-Mesh Escape Section.* The large-mesh escape section is constructed of 8 to 10 inch (20.3 to 25.4 cm), stretched mesh, webbing. This section is cut on the bar to form a section that is 15 inches (38.1 cm) in length by 95 inches (241.3 cm) in circumference. The leading edge is attached to the 6
1/2-mesh extension section and the rear edge is attached to the 23-mesh extension section.


(c) *Funnel.* The funnel is constructed of 1
1/2 inch (3.81 cm), stretched mesh, No. 30 depth-stretched and heat-set polyethylene webbing. The circumference of the leading edge is 120 meshes and the back edge is 78 meshes. The short side of the funnel is 34 to 36 inches (86.4 to 91.4 cm) long and the opposite side of the funnel extends an additional 22 to 24 inches (55.9 to 61.0 cm). The circumference of the leading edge of the funnel is attached to the forward small-mesh section three meshes forward of the large-mesh escape section and is evenly sewn, mesh for mesh, to the small-mesh section. The after edge of the funnel is attached to the after small-mesh section at its top and bottom eight meshes back from the large-mesh escape panel. Seven meshes of the top and seven meshes of the bottom of the funnel are attached to eight meshes at the top and bottom of the small-mesh section, such eight meshes being located immediately adjacent to the top and bottom centers of the small-mesh section on the side of the funnel's extended side. The extended side of the funnel is sewn at its top and bottom to the top and bottom of the small-mesh section, extending at an angle toward the top and bottom centers of the small-mesh section.


(d) *Semi-Rigid Hoop.* A 30-inch (76.2-cm) diameter hoop constructed of plastic-coated trawl cable, swaged together with a 
3/8-inch (9.53-mm) micropress sleeve, is installed five meshes behind the trailing edge of the large-mesh escape section. The extension webbing must be laced to the ring around the entire circumference and must be equally distributed on the hoop, that is, 30 meshes must be evenly attached to each quadrant.


(e) *Installation.* The extended funnel BRD is attached 8 inches (20.3 cm) behind the posterior edge of the TED. If it is attached behind a soft TED, a second semi-rigid hoop, as prescribed in paragraph A.2.(d), must be installed in the front section of the BRD extension webbing at the leading edge of the funnel. The cod end of the trawl net is attached to the trailing edge of the BRD.


3. *Minimum Construction and Installation Requirements for Inshore Size.*

(a) *Extension Material.* The small-mesh sections used on both sides of the large-mesh escape section are constructed of 1
3/8 inch (3.5 cm), No. 18 stretched mesh, nylon webbing. The front section is 120 meshes around by 6
1/2 meshes deep. The back section is 120 meshes around by 23 meshes deep.


(b) *Large-Mesh Escape Section.* The large-mesh escape section is constructed of 8 to 10 inch (20.3 to 25.4 cm), stretched mesh, webbing. This section is cut on the bar to form a section that is 15 inches (38.1 cm) by 75 inches (190.5 cm) in circumference. The leading edge is attached to the 6
1/2-mesh extension section and the rear edge is attached to the 23-mesh extension section.

3/8 inch (3.5 cm), stretched mesh, No. 18 depth-stretched and heat-set polyethylene webbing. The circumference of the leading edge is 120 meshes and the back edge is 78 meshes. The short side of the funnel is 30 to 32 inches (76.2 to 81.3 cm) long and the opposite side of the funnel extends an additional 20 to 22 inches (50.8 to 55.9 cm). The circumference of the leading edge of the funnel is attached to the forward small-mesh section three meshes forward of the large-mesh escape section and is evenly sewn, mesh for mesh, to the small-mesh section. The after edge of the funnel is attached to the after small-mesh section at its top and bottom eight meshes back from the large-mesh escape panel. Seven meshes of the top and seven meshes of the bottom of the funnel are attached to eight meshes at the top and bottom of the small-mesh section, such eight meshes being located immediately adjacent to the top and bottom centers of the small-mesh section on the side of the funnel's extended side. The extended side of the funnel is sewn at its top and bottom to the top and bottom of the small-mesh section, extending at an angle toward the top and bottom centers of the small-mesh section.


(d) *Semi-Rigid Hoop.* A 24-inch (61.0-cm) diameter hoop constructed of plastic-coated trawl cable, swaged together with a 
3/8-inch (9.53-mm) micropress sleeve, is installed five meshes behind the trailing edge of the large mesh section. The extension webbing must be laced to the ring around the entire circumference and must be equally distributed on the hoop, that is, 30 meshes must be evenly attached to each quadrant.


(e) *Installation.* The extended funnel BRD is attached 8 inches (20.3 cm) behind the posterior edge of the TED. If it is attached behind a soft TED, a second semi-rigid hoop, as prescribed in paragraph A.3.(d), must be installed in the front section of the BRD extension webbing at the leading edge of the funnel. The cod end of the trawl net is attached to the trailing edge of the BRD.


B. *Expanded Mesh.* The expanded mesh BRD is constructed and installed exactly the same as the standard size extended funnel BRD, except that one side of the funnel is not extended to form a lead panel.


C. *Fisheye.*

1. *Description.* The fisheye BRD is a cone-shaped rigid frame constructed from aluminum or steel rod of at least 
1/4 inch (6.35-mm) diameter, which is inserted into the cod end to form an escape opening.


2. *Minimum Construction and Installation Requirements.* The fisheye has a minimum escape opening dimension of 5 inches (12.7 cm) and a minimum total escape opening area of 36 in
2 (91.4 cm
2). When the fisheye BRD is installed, no part of the lazy line attachment system (*i.e.,* any mechanism, such as elephant ears or choker straps, used to attach the lazy line to the cod end) may overlap the fisheye escape opening when the fisheye is installed aft of the attachment point of the cod end retrieval system.


(a) In the Gulf EEZ, the fisheye BRD must be installed at the top center of the cod end of the trawl to create an opening in the trawl facing in the direction of the mouth of the trawl no further forward than 9 ft (2.7 m) from the cod end drawstring (tie-off rings).


(b) In the South Atlantic EEZ, the fisheye BRD must be installed at the top center of the cod end of the trawl to create an escape opening in the trawl facing the direction of the mouth of the trawl no further forward than 11 ft (3.4 m) from the cod end tie-off rings.


D. *Gulf fisheye.*

When the Gulf fisheye BRD is installed, no part of the lazy line attachment system (*i.e.,* any mechanism, such as elephant ears or choker straps, used to attach the lazy line to the cod end) may overlap the fisheye escape opening when the fisheye is installed aft of the attachment point of the cod end retrieval system.


E. *Jones-Davis.*

1. *Description.* The Jones-Davis BRD is similar to the expanded mesh and the extended funnel BRDs except that the fish escape openings are windows cut around the funnel rather than large-mesh sections. In addition, a webbing cone fish deflector is installed behind the funnel.


2. *Minimum Construction and Installation Requirements.* The Jones-Davis BRD must contain all of the following.


(a) *Webbing extension.* The webbing extension must be constructed from a single piece of 1
5/8-inch (3.5-cm) stretch mesh number 30 nylon 42 meshes by 120 meshes. A tube is formed from the extension webbing by sewing the 42-mesh side together.


(b) *28-inch (71.1-cm) cable hoop.* A single hoop must be constructed of 
1/2-inch (1.3-cm) steel cable 88 inches (223.5 cm) in length. The cable must be joined at its ends by a 3-inch (7.6-cm) piece of 
1/2-inch (1.3-cm) aluminum pipe and pressed with a 
3/8-inch (0.95-cm) die to form a hoop. The inside diameter of this hoop must be between 27 and 29 inches (68.6 and 73.7 cm). The hoop must be attached to the extension webbing 17
1/2 meshes behind the leading edge. The extension webbing must be quartered and attached in four places around the hoop, and every other mesh must be attached all the way around the hoop using number 24 twine or larger. The hoop must be laced with 
3/8-inch (0.95-cm) polypropylene or polyethylene rope for chaffing.


(c) *24-inch (61.0-cm) hoop.* A single hoop must be constructed of either number 60 twine 80 inches (203.2 cm) in length or 
3/8-inch (0.95-cm) steel cable 75
1/2 inches (191.8 cm) in length. If twine is used, the twine must be laced in and out of the extension webbing 39 meshes behind the leading edge, and the ends must be tied together. If cable is used, the cable must be joined at its ends by a 3-inch (7.6-cm) piece of 
3/8-inch (0.95-cm) aluminum pipe and pressed together with a 
1/4-inch (0.64-cm) die to form a hoop. The inside diameter of this hoop must be between 23 and 25 inches (58.4 and 63.4 cm). The hoop must be attached to the extension webbing 39 meshes behind the leading edge. The extension webbing must be quartered and attached in four places around the hoop, and every other mesh must be attached all the way around the hoop using number 24 twine or larger. The hoop must be laced with 
3/8-inch (0.95-cm) polypropylene or polyethylene rope for chaffing.


(d) *Funnel.* The funnel must be constructed from four sections of 1
1/2-inch (3.8-cm) heat-set and depth-stretched polypropylene or polyethylene webbing. The two side sections must be rectangular in shape, 29
1/2 meshes on the leading edge by 23 meshes deep. The top and bottom sections are 29
1/2 meshes on the leading edge by 23 meshes deep and tapered 1 point 2 bars on both sides down to 8 meshes across the back. The four sections must be sewn together down the 23-mesh edge to form the funnel.


(e) *Attachment of the funnel in the webbing extension.* The funnel must be installed two meshes behind the leading edge of the extension starting at the center seam of the extension and the center mesh of the funnel's top section leading edge. On the same row of meshes, the funnel must be sewn evenly all the way around the inside of the extension. The funnel's top and bottom back edges must be attached one mesh behind the 28-inch (71.1-cm) cable hoop (front hoop). Starting at the top center seam, the back edge of the top funnel section must be attached four meshes each side of the center. Counting around 60 meshes from the top center, the back edge of the bottom section must be attached 4 meshes on each side of the bottom center. Clearance between the side of the funnel and the 28-inch (71.1-cm) cable hoop (front hoop) must be at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) when measured in the hanging position.


(f) *Cutting the escape openings.* The leading edge of the escape opening must be located within 18 inches (45.7 cm) of the posterior edge of the turtle excluder device (TED) grid. The area of the escape opening must total at least 864 in
2 (5,574.2 cm
2). Two escape openings 10 meshes wide by 13 meshes deep must be cut 6 meshes apart in the extension webbing, starting at the top center extension seam, 3 meshes back from the leading edge and 16 meshes to the left and to the right (total of four openings). The four escape openings must be double selvaged for strength.


(g) *Alternative Method for Constructing the Funnel and Escape Openings.* The following method for constructing the funnel and escape openings may be used instead of the method described in paragraphs F.2.d., F.2.e., and F.2.f. of this section. With this alternative method, the funnel and escape openings are formed by cutting a flap in each side of the extension webbing; pushing the flaps inward; and attaching the top and bottom edges along the bars of the extension webbing to form the v-shape of the funnel. Minimum requirements applicable to this method include: The funnel's top and bottom back edges must be attached one mesh behind the 28-inch (71.1-cm) cable hoop (front hoop); clearance between the side of the funnel and the 28-inch (71.1-cm) cable hoop (front hoop) must be at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) when measured in the hanging position; the leading edge of the escape opening must be located within 18 inches (45.7 cm) of the posterior edge of the turtle excluder device (TED) grid; and, the area of the escape opening must total at least 864 in
2 (5,574.2 cm
2). To construct the funnel and escape openings using this method, begin 3
1/2 meshes from the leading edge of the extension, at the top center seam, count over 18 meshes on each side, and cut 13 meshes toward the back of the extension. Turn parallel to the leading edge, and cut 26 meshes toward the bottom center of the extension. Next, turn parallel to the top center seam, and cut 13 meshes forward toward the leading edge, creating a flap of webbing 13 meshes by 26 meshes by 13 meshes. Lengthen the flap to 18 meshes by adding a 4
1/2-mesh by 26-mesh rectangular section of webbing to the 26-mesh edge. Attach the 18-mesh edges to the top and bottom of the extension by sewing 2 bars of the extension to 1 mesh on the flap in toward the top center and bottom center of the extension, forming the exit opening and the funnel. Connect the two flaps together in the center with a 7-inch piece of number 42 twine to allow adequate clearance for fish escapement between the flaps and the side openings. On each side, sew a 6-mesh by 10
1/2-mesh section of webbing to 6 meshes of the center of the 26-mesh cut on the extension and 6 meshes centered between the 13-mesh cuts 3
1/2 meshes from the leading edge. This forms two 10-mesh by 13-mesh openings on each side.


(h) *Cone fish deflector.* The cone fish deflector is constructed of 2 pieces of 1
5/8-inch (4.13-cm) polypropylene or polyethylene webbing, 40 meshes wide by 20 meshes in length and cut on the bar on each side forming a triangle. Starting at the apex of the two triangles, the two pieces must be sewn together to form a cone of webbing. The apex of the cone fish deflector must be positioned within 10-14 inches (25.4-35.6 cm) of the posterior edge of the funnel.


(i) *11-inch (27.9-cm) cable hoop for cone deflector.* A single hoop must be constructed of 
5/16-inch (0.79-cm) or 
3/8-inch (0.95-cm) cable 34
1/2 inches (87.6 cm) in length. The ends must be joined by a 3-inch (7.6-cm) piece of 
3/8-inch (0.95-cm) aluminum pipe pressed together with a 
1/4-inch (0.64-cm) die. The hoop must be inserted in the webbing cone, attached 10 meshes from the apex and laced all the way around with heavy twine.


(j) *Installation of the cone in the extension.* The cone must be installed in the extension 12 inches (30.5 cm) behind the back edge of the funnel and attached in four places. The midpoint of a piece of number 60 twine 4 ft (1.22 m) in length must be attached to the apex of the cone. This piece of twine must be attached to the 28-inch (71.1-cm) cable hoop at the center of each of its sides; the points of attachment for the two pieces of twine must be measured 20 inches (50.8 cm) from the midpoint attachment. Two 8-inch (20.3-cm) pieces of number 60 twine must be attached to the top and bottom of the 11-inch (27.9-cm) cone hoop. The opposite ends of these two pieces of twine must be attached to the top and bottom center of the 24-inch (61-cm) cable hoop; the points of attachment for the two pieces of twine must be measured 4 inches (10.2 cm) from the points where they are tied to the 11-inch (27.9-cm) cone hoop.


F. *Modified Jones-Davis.*

1. *Description.* The Modified Jones-Davis BRD is a variation to the alternative funnel construction method of the Jones-Davis BRD except the funnel is assembled by using depth-stretched and heat-set polyethylene webbing instead of the flaps formed from the extension webbing. In addition, no hoops are used to hold the BRD open.


2. *Minimum Construction and Installation Requirements.* The Modified Jones-Davis BRD must contain all of the following.


(a) *Webbing extension.* The webbing extension must be constructed from a single rectangular piece of 1
5/8-inch (4.1-cm) stretch mesh number 30 nylon with dimensions of 39
1/2 meshes by 150 meshes. A tube is formed from the extension webbing by sewing the 39
1/2-mesh-sides together.

(c) *Cutting the escape opening.* The leading edge of the escape openings must be located within 18 inches (45.7 cm) of the posterior edge of the turtle excluder device (TED) grid. The area of the escape opening must total at least 635 in
2 (4,097 cm
2). Two escape openings, 6 meshes wide by 12 meshes deep, must be cut 4 meshes apart in the extension webbing, starting at the top center extension seam, 7 meshes back from the leading edge, and 30 meshes to the left and to the right (total of four openings). The four escape openings must be double selvaged for strength.


(d) *Cone fish deflector.* The cone fish deflector is constructed of 2 pieces of 1
5/8-inch (4.1-cm) polypropylene or polyethylene webbing, 40 meshes wide by 20 meshes in length and cut on the bar on each side forming a triangle. Starting at the apex of the two triangles, the two pieces must be sewn together to form a cone of webbing. The apex of the cone fish deflector must be positioned within 12 inches (30.5 cm) of the posterior edge of the funnel.


(e) *11-inch (27.9-cm) cable hoop for cone deflector.* A single hoop must be constructed of

(f) *Installation of the cone in the extension.* The apex of the cone must be installed in the extension within 12 inches (30.5 cm) behind the back edge of the funnel and attached in four places. The midpoint of a piece of number 60 twine (or at least 4-mesh wide strip of number 21 or heavier webbing) 3 ft (1.22 m) in length must be attached to the apex of the cone. This piece of twine or webbing must be attached within 5 meshes of the aft edge of the funnel at the center of each of its sides. Two 12-inch (30.5-cm) pieces of number 60 (or heavier) twine must be attached to the top and bottom of the 11-inch (27.9-cm) cone hoop. The opposite ends of these two pieces of twine must be attached to the top and bottom center of the extension webbing to keep the cone from inverting into the funnel.


G. [Reserved]


H. *Cone Fish Deflector Composite Panel.* 1. *Description.* The Cone Fish Deflector Composite Panel BRD is a variation to the alternative funnel construction method of the Jones-Davis BRD, except the funnel is assembled by using depth-stretched and heat-set polyethylene webbing with square mesh panels on the inside instead of the flaps formed from the extension webbing. In addition, no hoops are used to hold the BRD open.


2. *Minimum Construction and Installation Requirements.* The Cone Fish Deflector Composite Panel BRD must contain all of the following:


(a) *Webbing extension.* The webbing extension must be constructed from a single rectangular piece of 1
1/2-inch to 1
3/4-inch (3.8-cm to 4.5-cm) stretch mesh with dimensions of 24
1/2 meshes by 150 to 160 meshes. A tube is formed from the extension webbing piece by sewing the 24
1/2-mesh sides together. The leading edge of the webbing extension must be attached no more than 4 meshes from the posterior edge of the TED grid.


(b) *Funnel.* The V-shaped funnel consists of two webbing panels attached to the extension along the leading edge of the panels. The top and bottom edges of the panels are sewn diagonally across the extension toward the center to form the funnel. The panels are 2-ply in design, each with an inner layer of 1
1/2-inch to 1
5/8-inch (3.8-cm to 4.1-cm) heat-set and depth-stretched polyethylene webbing and an outer layer constructed of no larger than 2-inch (5.1-cm) square mesh webbing (1-inch bar). The inner webbing layer must be rectangular in shape, 36 meshes on the leading edge by 20 meshes deep. The 36-mesh leading edges of the polyethylene webbing should be sewn evenly to 24 meshes of the extension webbing 1
1/2 meshes from and parallel to the leading edge of the extension starting 12 meshes up from the bottom center on each side. Alternately sew 2 meshes of the polyethylene webbing to 1 mesh of the extension webbing then 1 mesh of the polyethylene webbing to 1 mesh of the extension webbing toward the top. The bottom 20-mesh edges of the polyethylene layers are sewn evenly to the extension webbing on a 2 bar 1 mesh angle toward the bottom back center forming a v-shape in the bottom of the extension webbing. The top 20-mesh edges of the polyethylene layers are sewn evenly along the bars of the extension webbing toward the top back center. The square mesh layers must be rectangular in shape and constructed of no larger than 2-inch (5.1-cm) webbing that is 18 inches (45.7 cm) in length on the leading edge. The depth of the square mesh layer must be no more than 2 inches (5.1 cm) less than the 20 mesh side of the inner polyethylene layer when stretched taught. The 18-inch (45.7-cm) leading edge of each square mesh layer must be sewn evenly to the 36-mesh leading edge of the polyethylene section and the sides are sewn evenly (in length) to the 20-mesh edges of the polyethylene webbing. This will form a v-shape funnel using the top of the extension webbing as the top of the funnel and the bottom of the extension webbing as the bottom of the funnel.


(c) *Cutting the escape opening.* There are two escape openings on each side of the funnel. The leading edge of the escape openings must be located on the same row of meshes in the extension webbing as the leading edge of the composite panels. The lower openings are formed by starting at the first attachment point of the composite panels and cutting 9 meshes in the extension webbing on an even row of meshes toward the top of the extension. Next, turn 90 degrees and cut 15 points on an even row toward the back of the extension webbing. At this point turn and cut 18 bars toward the bottom front of the extension webbing. Finish the escape opening by cutting 6 points toward the original starting point. The top escape openings start 5 meshes above and mirror the lower openings. Starting at the leading edge of the composite panel and 5 meshes above the lower escape opening, cut 9 meshes in the extension on an even row of meshes toward the top of the extension. Next, turn 90 degrees, and cut 6 points on an even row toward the back of the extension webbing. Then cut 18 bars toward the bottom back of the extension. To complete the escape opening, cut 15 points forward toward the original starting point. The area of each escape opening must total at least 212 in
2 (1,368 cm
2). The four escape openings must be double selvaged for strength.


(d) *Cone fish deflector.* The cone fish deflector is constructed of 2 pieces of 1
5/8-inch (4.1-cm) polypropylene or polyethylene webbing, 40 meshes wide by 20 meshes in length and cut on the bar on each side forming a triangle. Starting at the apex of the two triangles, the two pieces must be sewn together to form a cone of webbing. The apex of the cone fish deflector must be positioned within 12 inches (30.5 cm) of the posterior edge of the funnel.


(e) *11-inch (27.9-cm) cable hoop for cone deflector.* A single hoop must be constructed of 
5/16-inch (0.79-cm) or 
3/8-inch (0.95-cm) cable 34
1/2 inches (87.6 cm) in length. The ends must be joined by a 3-inch (7.6-cm) piece of 
3/8-inch (0.95-cm) aluminum pipe pressed together with a 
1/4-inch (0.64-cm) die. The hoop must be inserted in the webbing cone, attached 10 meshes from the apex and laced all the way around with heavy twine.


(f) *Installation of the cone in the extension.* The apex of the cone must be installed in the extension within 12 inches (30.5 cm) behind the back edge of the funnel and attached in four places. The midpoint of a piece of number 60 twine (or at least 4-mesh wide strip of number 21 or heavier webbing) 3 ft (1.22 m) in length must be attached to the apex of the cone. This piece of twine or webbing must be attached within 5 meshes of the aft edge of the funnel at the center of each of its sides. Two 12-inch (30.5-cm) pieces of number 60 (or heavier) twine must be attached to the top and bottom of the 11-inch (27.9-cm) cone hoop. The opposite ends of these two pieces of twine must be attached to the top and bottom center of the extension webbing to keep the cone from inverting into the funnel.


I. *Square Mesh Panel (SMP) Composite Panel*

1. *Description.* The SMP is a panel of square mesh webbing placed in the top of the cod end to provide finfish escape openings.


2. *Minimum Construction and Installation Requirements.* The SMP Composite Panel BRD must contain all of the following:


(a) *Webbing extension.* The webbing extension must be constructed from a single rectangular piece of 1
1/2-inch to 1
3/4-inch (3.8-cm to 4.5-cm) stretch mesh with dimensions of 24
1/2 meshes by 150 to 160 meshes. A tube is formed from the extension webbing piece by sewing the 24
1/2-mesh sides together. The leading edge of the webbing extension must be attached no more than 4 meshes from the posterior edge of the TED grid.


(b) *Funnel.* The V-shaped funnel consists of two webbing panels attached to the extension along the leading edge of the panels. The top and bottom edges of the panels are sewn diagonally across the extension toward the center to form the funnel. The panels are 2-ply in design, each with an inner layer of 1
1/2-inch to 1
5/8-inch (3.8-cm to 4.1-cm) heat-set and depth-stretched polyethylene webbing and an outer layer constructed of no larger than 2-inch (5.1-cm) square mesh webbing (1-inch bar). The inner webbing layer must be rectangular in shape, 36 meshes on the leading edge by 20 meshes deep. The 36-mesh leading edges of the polyethylene webbing should be sewn evenly to 24 meshes of the extension webbing 1
1/2 meshes from and parallel to the leading edge of the extension starting 12 meshes up from the bottom center on each side. Alternately sew 2 meshes of the polyethylene webbing to 1 mesh of the extension webbing then 1 mesh of the polyethylene webbing to 1 mesh of the extension webbing toward the top. The bottom 20-mesh edges of the polyethylene layers are sewn evenly to the extension webbing on a 2 bar 1 mesh angle toward the bottom back center forming a v-shape in the bottom of the extension webbing. The top 20-mesh edges of the polyethylene layers are sewn evenly along the bars of the extension webbing toward the top back center. The square mesh layers must be rectangular in shape and constructed of no larger than 2-inch (5.1-cm) webbing that is 18 inches (45.7 cm) in length on the leading edge. The depth of the square mesh layer must be no more than 2 inches (5.1 cm) less than the 20 mesh side of the inner polyethylene layer when stretched taught. The 18-inch (45.7-cm) leading edge of each square mesh layer must be sewn evenly to the 36-mesh leading edge of the polyethylene section and the sides are sewn evenly (in length) to the 20-mesh edges of the polyethylene webbing. This will form a v-shape funnel using the top of the extension webbing as the top of the funnel and the bottom of the extension webbing as the bottom of the funnel.


(c) *Cutting the escape opening.* There are two escape openings on each side of the funnel. The leading edge of the escape openings must be located on the same row of meshes in the extension webbing as the leading edge of the composite panels. The lower openings are formed by starting at the first attachment point of the composite panels and cutting 9 meshes in the extension webbing on an even row of meshes toward the top of the extension. Next, turn 90 degrees and cut 15 points on an even row toward the back of the extension webbing. At this point turn and cut 18 bars toward the bottom front of the extension webbing. Finish the escape opening by cutting 6 points toward the original starting point. The top escape openings start 5 meshes above and mirror the lower openings. Starting at the leading edge of the composite panel and 5 meshes above the lower escape opening, cut 9 meshes in the extension on an even row of meshes toward the top of the extension. Next, turn 90 degrees, and cut 6 points on an even row toward the back of the extension webbing. Then cut 18 bars toward the bottom back of the extension. To complete the escape opening, cut 15 points forward toward the original starting point. The area of each escape opening must total at least 212 in
2 (1,368 cm
2). The four escape openings must be double selvaged for strength.


(d) *SMP.* The SMP is constructed from a single piece of square mesh webbing with a minimum dimension of 5 squares wide and 12 squares in length with a minimum mesh size of 3-inch (76-mm) stretched mesh. The maximum twine diameter of the square mesh is number 96 twine (4 mm).


(e) *Cutting the SMP escape opening.* The escape opening is a rectangular hole cut in the top center of the cod end webbing. The posterior edge of the escape opening must be placed no farther forward that 8 ft (2.4 m) from the cod end drawstring (tie-off rings). The width of the escape opening, as measured across the cod end, must be four cod end meshes per square of the SMP (*i.e.,* a cut of 20 cod end meshes for a SMP that is 5 meshes wide). The stretched mesh length of the escape opening must be equal to the total length of the SMP. No portion of the SMP escape opening may be covered with additional material or netting such as chaffing webbing, which might impede or prevent fish escapement.


(f) *Installation of the SMP.* The SMP must be attached to the edge of the escape opening evenly around the perimeter of the escape opening cut with heavy twine.
