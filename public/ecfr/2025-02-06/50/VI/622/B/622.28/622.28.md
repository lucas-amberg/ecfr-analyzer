# § 622.28   Vessel monitoring systems (VMSs).

The VMS requirements of this section apply throughout the Gulf of Mexico and adjacent states.


(a) *General VMS requirement.* An owner or operator of a vessel that has been issued a commercial vessel permit for Gulf reef fish, including a charter vessel/headboat issued such a permit even when under charter, must ensure that such vessel has an operating VMS approved by NMFS for use in the Gulf reef fish fishery on board at all times whether or not the vessel is underway, unless exempted by NMFS under the power-down exemptions specified in paragraph (d) of this section and in the NOAA Enforcement Vessel Monitoring System Requirements for the Reef Fish Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico. This NOAA Enforcement Vessel Monitoring System Requirements document is available from NMFS Office for Law Enforcement (OLE), Southeast Region, 263 13th Avenue South, St. Petersburg, FL 33701; phone: 800-758-4833. An operating VMS includes an operating mobile transmitting unit on the vessel and a functioning communication link between the unit and NMFS as provided by a NMFS-approved communication service provider. NMFS OLE maintains a current list of approved VMS units and communication providers which is available from the VMS Support Center, NMFS OLE, 8484 Georgia Avenue, Suite 415, Silver Spring, MD 20910 or by calling toll free: 888-219-9228. If a VMS unit approved for the Gulf reef fish fishery is removed from the approved list by NMFS OLE, a vessel owner who purchased and installed such a VMS unit prior to its removal from the approved list will be considered to be in compliance with the requirement to have an approved unit, unless otherwise notified by NMFS OLE. At the end of a VMS unit's service life, it must be replaced with a currently approved unit for the fishery.


(b) *Hourly reporting requirement.* An owner or operator of a vessel subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section must ensure that the required VMS unit transmits a signal indicating the vessel's accurate position at least once an hour, 24 hours a day every day unless exempted under paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section.


(c) *In-port exemption.* While in port, an owner or operator of a vessel with a type-approved VMS unit configured with the 4-hour reporting feature may utilize the 4-hour reporting feature rather than comply with the hourly reporting requirement specified in paragraph (b) of this section. Once the vessel is no longer in port, the hourly reporting requirement specified in paragraph (b) of this section applies. For the purposes of this section, “in port” means secured at a land-based facility, or moored or anchored after the return to a dock, berth, beach, seawall, or ramp.


(d) *Power-down exemptions.* An owner or operator of a vessel subject to the requirement to have a VMS operating at all times as specified in paragraph (a) of this section can be exempted from that requirement and may power down the required VMS unit as specified in the following provisions.


(1) The vessel will be continuously out of the water or in port, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, for more than 72 consecutive hours.


(2) The owner or operator of the vessel requests and obtains authorization from NMFS OLE to power-down the VMS unit on the same vessel. VMS units must remain on and positioning until the vessel owner or operator receives such authorization. A request for a power-down exemption must be completed through a NMFS website. The request must provide the specified information, such as, the identity of person making the request, vessel owner, vessel identification, and the reason for an exemption. Authorization for the power-down is displayed on the website after submission of all required information and is transmitted by email to the requester and the vessel owner, if different from the requester. After receipt of the authorization, the VMS unit may be turned off for the approved time period.


(3) If a vessel with an approved VMS power-down exemption submits a trip declaration, as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, before the power-down exemption expires, the power-down exemption will be void, and the vessel is required to have a VMS operating at all times as specified in paragraph (a) of this section. Authorization for a new power-down exemption will be required before the vessel can subsequently power-down the VMS unit.


(4) An approved VMS power-down exemption is not transferrable and is granted only to the vessel owner, vessel, and the commercial reef fish permit number contained in the authorization.


(5) The maximum period for a single approved VMS power-down exemption is 1 year from the date that NMFS grants the VMS power-down exemption. A vessel owner or operator may request a subsequent VMS power-down exemption for the same vessel after the expiration of the preceding power-down exemption.






(e) *Declaration of fishing trip and gear.* Prior to departure for each trip, a vessel owner or operator must report to NMFS any fishery the vessel will participate in on that trip and the specific type(s) of fishing gear, using NMFS-defined gear codes, that will be on board the vessel. This information may be reported to NMFS using the toll-free number, 888-219-9228, or via an attached VMS terminal.




(f) *Installation and activation of a VMS.* Only a VMS that has been approved by NMFS for the Gulf reef fish fishery may be used, and the VMS must be installed by a qualified marine electrician.






(g) *Interference with the VMS.* No person may interfere with, tamper with, alter, damage, disable, or impede the operation of the VMS, or attempt any of the same.


(h) *Interruption of operation of the VMS.* When a vessel's VMS is not operating properly, the owner or operator must immediately contact NMFS Office for Law Enforcement, Southeast Region, 263 13th Avenue South, St. Petersburg, FL 33701, phone: 800-758-4833, and follow instructions from that office. If notified by NMFS that a vessel's VMS is not operating properly, the owner and operator must follow instructions from that office. In either event, such instructions may include, but are not limited to, manually communicating to a location designated by NMFS the vessel's positions or returning to port until the VMS is operable.


(i) *Access to position data.* As a condition of authorized fishing for or possession of fish in a fishery subject to VMS requirements in this section, a vessel owner or operator subject to the requirements for a VMS in this section must allow NMFS, the USCG, and their authorized officers and designees access to the vessel's position data obtained from the VMS.
