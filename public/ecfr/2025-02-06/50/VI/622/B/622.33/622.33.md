The operator of a vessel that fishes in the EEZ is responsible for the limit applicable to that vessel. (Note: Nassau grouper in the Gulf EEZ may not be harvested or possessed, as specified in ยง 622.181(b)(1).)


(b) *Goliath grouper.* Goliath grouper may not be harvested or possessed in or from the Gulf EEZ.

Such damage includes, but is not limited to, broken fin spines, fin rays, or teeth; visually obvious loss of scales; and cuts or abrasions on the body of the fish, particularly on the head, snout, or mouth.
