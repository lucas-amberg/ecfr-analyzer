A person aboard a vessel that has been issued a charter vessel/headboat permit for Gulf reef fish any time during the fishing year may not harvest or possess red snapper in or from the Gulf when the Federal charter vessel/headboat component is closed. When the Federal charter vessel/headboat component is open, a person on board a vessel that has been issued a charter vessel/headboat permit for Gulf reef fish at any time during the fishing year may harvest or possess red snapper in or from the Gulf only when the vessel is operating as a charter vessel or headboat.

In addition, the bag and possession limits for red snapper, when applicable, apply on board a vessel for which a commercial permit for Gulf reef fish has been issued, as required under § 622.20(a)(1), without regard to where such red snapper were harvested. The application of bag limits described in this paragraph (b)(1) notwithstanding, bag limits of Gulf reef fish may not be possessed on board a vessel with commercial quantities of Gulf reef fish, *i.e.,* Gulf reef fish in excess of applicable bag/possession limits, on board, as specified in § 622.38(a)(2). The prohibition on sale/purchase during a closure for Gulf reef fish does not apply to Gulf reef fish that were harvested, landed ashore, and sold prior to the effective date of the closure and were held in cold storage by a dealer or processor.

(c) *Restrictions applicable after a recreational quota closure or recreational component quota closure.* The bag limit for the applicable species for the recreational sector or recreational sector component in or from the Gulf EEZ is zero. When the Federal charter vessel/headboat component is closed or the entire recreational sector is closed, this bag and possession limit applies in the Gulf on board a vessel for which a valid Federal charter vessel/headboat permit for Gulf reef fish has been issued, without regard to where such species were harvested, *i.e.,* in state or Federal waters.
