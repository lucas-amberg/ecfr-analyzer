# § 622.104   Restricted access zones.

(a) *Establishment of restricted access zones.* NMFS will establish a restricted access zone for each aquaculture facility. The boundaries of the restricted access zone will correspond with the coordinates listed on the approved ACOE Section 10 permit associated with the aquaculture facility.


(b) *Prohibited activities within a restricted access zone.* No recreational fishing or commercial fishing, other than aquaculture, may occur in the restricted access zone. No fishing vessel may operate in or transit through the restricted access zone unless the vessel has on board a copy of the aquaculture facility's permit with an original signature, *i.e.,* not a copy of the signature, of the permittee.


(c) *Marking requirement.* The permittee must mark the restricted access zone with a floating device such as a buoy at each corner of the zone, as authorized by the USCG. Each floating device must clearly display the aquaculture facility's permit number and the words “RESTRICTED ACCESS” in block characters at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) in height and in a color that contrasts with the color of the floating device.
