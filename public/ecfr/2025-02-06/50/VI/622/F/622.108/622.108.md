# ยง 622.108   Remedial actions.

(a) *Potential remedial actions by NMFS.* In addition to potential permit sanctions and denials in accordance with subpart D of 15 CFR part 904, NMFS may take the following actions, as warranted, to avoid or mitigate adverse impacts associated with aquaculture in the Gulf EEZ.


(1) *Actions to address pathogen episodes.* NMFS, in cooperation with USDA's APHIS, may order movement restrictions and/or the removal of all cultured animals from an approved aquaculture system upon confirmation by a USDA's APHIS reference laboratory that an OIE-reportable pathogen, or additional pathogens that are subsequently identified as reportable pathogens in the NAAHP exists and USDA's APHIS and NMFS determine the pathogen poses a significant threat to the health of wild or cultured aquatic organisms.


(2) *Actions to address genetic issues.* NMFS may sample cultured animals to determine genetic lineage and, upon a determination that genetically engineered or transgenic animals were used or possessed at an aquaculture facility, will order the removal of all cultured animals of the species for which such determination was made. In conducting the genetic testing to determine that all broodstock or progeny of such broodstock will be or were originally harvested from U.S. waters of the Gulf, will be or were from the same population or sub-population that occurs where the facility is located, and that juveniles stocked in offshore aquaculture systems are the progeny of wild broodstock, or other genetic testing necessary to carry out the requirements of the FMP, NMFS may enter into cooperative agreements with States, may delegate the testing authority to any State, or may contract with any non-Federal Government entities. As a condition of the permit, NMFS may also require the permittee to contract a non-Federal Government third party approved by the RA if the RA agrees to accept the third party testing results. The non-Federal Government third party may not be the same entity as the permittee.
