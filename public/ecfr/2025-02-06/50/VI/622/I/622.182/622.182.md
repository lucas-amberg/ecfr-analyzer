(2) To determine what restrictions apply in the SMZs listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, follow this table:




(b) *Longline prohibited areas.* A longline may not be used to fish in the EEZ for South Atlantic snapper-grouper south of 27°10′ N. lat. (due east of the entrance to St. Lucie Inlet, FL); or north of 27°10′ N. lat. where the charted depth is less than 50 fathoms (91.4 m), as shown on the latest edition of the largest scale NOAA chart of the location. A person aboard a vessel with a longline on board that fishes on a trip in the South Atlantic EEZ south of 27°10′ N. lat., or north of 27°10′ N. lat. where the charted depth is less than 50 fathoms (91.4 m), is limited on that trip to the bag limit for South Atlantic snapper-grouper for which a bag limit is specified in § 622.187(b), and to zero for all other South Atlantic snapper-grouper. For the purpose of this paragraph, a vessel is considered to have a longline on board when a power-operated longline hauler, a cable or monofilament of diameter and length suitable for use in the longline fishery, and gangions are on board. Removal of any one of these three elements constitutes removal of a longline.


(c) [Reserved]

(d) *Sea bass pot prohibited area.* A sea bass pot may not be used in the South Atlantic EEZ south of 28°35.1′ N. lat. (due east of the NASA Vehicle Assembly Building, Cape Canaveral, FL). A sea bass pot deployed in the EEZ south of 28°35.1′ N. lat. may be disposed of in any appropriate manner by the Assistant Administrator or an authorized officer.


(d) [Reserved]


(e) *SMZs off North Carolina.* (1) The center of each SMZ in Table 3 to this paragraph (e) is located at the given point with a radius extending the applicable distance in every direction laterally from that point to form a circle around the center point.


(2) Harvest of South Atlantic snapper-grouper while in the SMZs in this paragraph (e) is permitted only by handline, rod and reel, and spearfishing gear. All harvest of South Atlantic snapper-grouper by spearfishing gear in the SMZs in this paragraph (e) is limited to the applicable recreational bag and possession limits in § 622.187.


(f) *Additional SMZs off South Carolina.* (1) The center of each SMZ in Table 4 to this paragraph (f) is located at the given point with a radius extending the applicable distance in every direction laterally from that point to form a circle around the center point.


(2) Harvest of South Atlantic snapper-grouper while in the SMZs in this paragraph (f) is permitted only by handline, rod and reel, and spearfishing gear (excludes a powerhead). All harvest of South Atlantic snapper-grouper by the allowable gear in the SMZs in this paragraph (f) is limited to the applicable recreational bag and possession limits in § 622.187.


(3) *PA-04—Ron McManus Memorial Reef.* This SMZ is bounded by lines connecting the following corner points: northwest corner point at 33°46.400′ N, 78°36.200′ W; northeast corner point at 33°46.400′ N, 78°35.600′ W; southeast corner point at 33°45.900′ N, 78°35.600′ W; and southwest corner point at 33°45.900′ N, 78°36.200′ W.
