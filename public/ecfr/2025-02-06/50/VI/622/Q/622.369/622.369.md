# § 622.369   Description of zones.

(a) *Migratory groups of king mackerel.* In the EEZ, king mackerel are divided into the Gulf migratory group and the Atlantic migratory group. The Gulf migratory group is bound by a line extending east of the U.S./Mexico border and a line extending east of the Miami-Dade/Monroe County, FL, boundary. The Atlantic migratory group is bound by a line extending east of the Miami-Dade/Monroe County, FL, boundary and a line from the intersection point of Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New York (as described in § 600.105(a) of this chapter). The zone boundaries remain in place year round. See Table 1 of this section for the boundary coordinates. See Figure 1 in Appendix G of this part for illustration.


(1) *Gulf migratory group.* The Gulf migratory group is divided into western, northern, and southern zones. See Table 1 of this section for the boundary coordinates. See Figure 1 in Appendix G of this part for illustration.


(i) *Western zone.* The western zone encompasses an area of the EEZ north of a line extending east of the US/Mexico border, and west of a line extending due south of the Alabama/Florida border, including the EEZ off Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.


(ii) *Northern zone.* The northern zone encompasses an area of the EEZ east of a line extending due south of the Florida/Alabama border, and north of a line extending due west of the Lee/Collier County, FL, boundary.


(iii) *Southern zone.* The southern zone encompasses an area of the EEZ south of a line extending due west of the Lee/Collier County, FL, boundary on the FL west coast, and south of a line extending due east of the Monroe/Miami-Dade County, FL, boundary on the FL east coast, which includes the EEZ off Collier and Monroe Counties, FL.


(2) *Atlantic migratory group.* The Atlantic migratory group is divided into the northern and southern zones separated by a line extending from the North Carolina/South Carolina border, as specified in § 622.2. See Table 1 of this section for the boundary coordinates. See Figure 1 in Appendix G of this part for illustration. See § 622.385(a)(1) for a description of the areas for Atlantic migratory group king mackerel commercial trip limits.


(i) *Northern zone.* The northern zone encompasses an area of the EEZ south of a line extending from the intersection point of New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island (as described in § 600.105(a) of this chapter), and north of a line extending from the North Carolina/South Carolina border, as specified in § 622.2, including the EEZ off each state from North Carolina to New York. This zone remains the same year round.


(ii) *Southern zone.* The southern zone encompasses an area of the EEZ south of a line extending from the North Carolina/South Carolina border, as specified in § 622.2, and north of a line extending due east of the Monroe/Miami-Dade County, FL, boundary.


(b) *Migratory groups of Spanish mackerel*—(1) *Gulf migratory group.* In the EEZ, the Gulf migratory group is bounded by a line extending east of the U.S./Mexico border and a line extending due east of the Monroe/Miami-Dade County, FL, boundary. See Table 2 of this section for the boundary coordinates. See Figure 2 in Appendix G of this part for illustration.


(2) *Atlantic migratory group.* In the EEZ, the Atlantic migratory group is bounded by a line extending due east of the Monroe/Miami-Dade County, FL, boundary and a line extending from the intersection point of New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island (as described in § 600.105(a) of this chapter). The Atlantic migratory group is divided into the northern and southern zones. See Table 2 of this section for the boundary coordinates. See Figure 2 in Appendix G of this part for illustration. See § 622.385(b)(1) for a description of the areas for Atlantic migratory group Spanish mackerel commercial trip limits.


(i) *Northern zone.* The northern zone encompasses an area of the EEZ south of a line extending from the intersection point of New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island (as described in § 600.105(a) of this chapter), and north of a line extending from the North Carolina/South Carolina border, as specified in § 622.2, including the EEZ off each state from North Carolina to New York.


(ii) *Southern zone.* The southern zone encompasses an area of the EEZ south of a line extending from the North Carolina/South Carolina border, as specified in § 622.2, and north of a line extending due east of the Monroe/Miami-Dade County, FL, boundary, including the EEZ off South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.


(c) *Migratory groups of cobia*—(1) *Gulf migratory group.* In the EEZ, the Gulf migratory group is bounded by a line extending east from the United States/Mexico border and a line extending due east from the Florida/Georgia border. See Table 3 of this section for the boundary coordinates. (See Figure 3 in Appendix G of this part for illustration.)


(i) *Gulf zone.* The Gulf zone encompasses an area of the EEZ north of a line extending east of the United States/Mexico border, and north and west of the line of demarcation between the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico (the Council boundary, as described in § 600.105(c) of this chapter).


(ii) *Florida east coast zone.* The Florida east coast zone encompasses an area of the EEZ south and east of the line of demarcation between the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico (as described in § 600.105(c) of this chapter), and south of a line extending due east from the Florida/Georgia border.


(2) *Atlantic migratory group.* In the EEZ, the Atlantic migratory group is bounded by a line extending from the intersection point of New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island (as described in § 600.105(a) of this chapter) and a line extending due east of the Florida/Georgia border. See Table 3 of this section for the boundary coordinates. (See Figure 3 in Appendix G of this part for illustration.)
