# § 622.388   Annual catch limits (ACLs), annual catch targets (ACTs), and accountability measures (AMs).

All weights are in round and eviscerated weight combined, unless specified otherwise.


(a) *Gulf migratory group king mackerel*—(1) *Commercial sector.* (i) If commercial landings, as estimated by the SRD, reach or are projected to reach the applicable quota specified in § 622.384(b)(1), the AA will file a notification with the Office of the Federal Register to close the commercial sector for that zone, or gear type for the remainder of the fishing year.


(ii) The commercial ACL for the Gulf migratory group of king mackerel is 2,998,400 lb (1,360,051 kg) for the 2021-2022 fishing year, 3,110,400 lb (1,410,854 kg) for the 2022-2023 fishing year, and 3,196,800 lb (1,450,044 kg) for the 2023-2024 and subsequent fishing years. The ACL is further divided into a commercial ACL for vessels fishing with hook-and-line and a commercial ACL for vessels fishing with run-around gillnets. The hook-and-line ACL (which applies to the entire Gulf) is 2,368,736 lb (1,074,441 kg) for the 2021-2022 fishing year, 2,457,216 lb (1,114,574 kg) for the 2022-2023 fishing year, and 2,525,472 lb (1,145,535 kg) for the 2023-2024 and subsequent fishing years. The run-around gillnet ACL (which applies to the southern zone) is 629,664 lb (285,611 kg) for the 2021-2022 fishing year, 653,184 lb (296,279 kg) for the 2022-2023 fishing year, and 671,328 lb (304,509 kg) for the 2023-2024 and subsequent fishing years.


(iii) If commercial landings of Gulf migratory group king mackerel caught by run-around gillnet in the southern zone, as estimated by the SRD, exceed the commercial ACL, the AA will file a notification with the Office of the Federal Register to reduce the commercial ACL for king mackerel harvested by run-around gillnet in the southern zone in the following fishing year by the amount of the commercial ACL overage in the prior fishing year.


(2) *Recreational sector.* If recreational landings, as estimated by the SRD, reach or are projected to reach the recreational ACL of 6,371,600 lb (2,890,109 kg) for the 2021-2022 fishing year, 6,609,600 lb (2,998,064 kg) for the 2022-2023 fishing year, and 6,793,200 lb (3,081,344 kg) for the 2023-2024 and subsequent fishing years, the AA will file a notification with the Office of the Federal Register to implement bag and possession limits for Gulf migratory group king mackerel of zero, unless the best scientific information available determines that a bag limit reduction is unnecessary.


(3) For purposes of tracking the ACL, recreational landings will be monitored based on the commercial fishing year.


(b) *Atlantic migratory group king mackerel*—(1) *Commercial sector.* (i) If commercial landings, as estimated by the SRD, reach or are projected to reach the applicable quota for the zone or season specified in § 622.384(b)(2), the AA will file a notification with the Office of the Federal Register to close the commercial sector for that zone for the remainder of the applicable fishing season or fishing year.
