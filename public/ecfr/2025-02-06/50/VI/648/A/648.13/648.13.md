(2) Vessels issued a Federal multispecies permit under § 648.4(a)(1) may transfer from one vessel to another, for use as bait, up to 500 lb (226.8 kg) of silver hake and unlimited amounts of red hake, per trip, provided:

(f) *Atlantic herring.* With the exception of transfers made to an at-sea processing vessel issued the required permit under § 648.6(a)(2)(ii), any person or vessel, including any vessel issued an Atlantic herring permit, is prohibited from transferring, receiving, or attempting to transfer or receive any Atlantic herring taken from the EEZ, except as authorized in this paragraph (f), and in compliance with reporting requirements at § 648.7 (b)(2)(i)(D).


(1) *Personal use as bait.* (i) The operator of a vessel that is not issued an Atlantic herring permit may purchase and/or receive Atlantic herring at sea for personal use as bait, provided the vessel receiving the transfer does not have purse seine, midwater trawl, pelagic gillnet, sink gillnet, or bottom trawl gear on board;


(ii) A vessel issued an Atlantic herring permit may transfer herring at sea to another vessel for personal use as bait:


(A) Provided the transferring vessel is issued a letter of authorization to transfer fish. The operator of the transferring vessel must show the letter of authorization to a representative of the vessel receiving fish or any authorized officer upon request; and


(B) Provided that the transfer of herring at sea to another vessel for personal use as bait does not exceed the possession limit specified for the transferring vessel in § 648.204, except that no more than the applicable 2,000 lb (907.2 kg) or 40,000 lb (18,143.7 kg) herring possession limit may be caught or transferred per trip or per calendar day if the vessel is in, or the fish were harvested from, a management area subject to a possession limit adjustment or fishery closure as specified in § 648.201.


(2) *Atlantic herring carrier vessels.* (i) A vessel issued an Atlantic herring permit may operate as a herring carrier vessel and receive herring provided it either is issued a carrier vessel letter of authorization and complies with the terms of that authorization, as specified in § 648.4(a)(10)(ii), or it must have been issued and have on board a herring permit and have declared an Atlantic herring carrier trip via VMS, consistent with the requirements at § 648.10(l)(1).


(ii) A vessel issued an Atlantic herring permit may transfer herring at sea to an Atlantic herring carrier up to the applicable possession limits specified in § 648.204, provided it is issued a letter of authorization for the transfer of herring and that no more than the applicable 2,000 lb (907.2 kg) or 40,000 lb (18,143.7 kg) herring possession limit may be caught or transferred at sea per trip or per calendar day if the vessel is in, or the fish were harvested from, an area subject to a possession limit adjustment or fishery closure as specified in § 648.201.

(5) *Transfer to at-sea processors.* A vessel issued an Atlantic herring permit may transfer herring to a vessel issued an at-sea processing permit specified in § 648.6(a)(2)(ii), up to the applicable possession limit specified in § 648.204, except that no more than the applicable 2,000 lb (907.2 kg) or 40,000 lb (18,143.7 kg) herring possession limit may be caught or transferred at sea per trip or per calendar day if the vessel is in, or the fish were harvested from, a management area subject to a possession limit adjustment or fishery closure as specified in § 648.201.
