# ยง 648.122   Scup specifications.

(a) *Commercial quota, recreational landing limits, research set-asides, and other specification measures.* The Monitoring Committee shall recommend to the MAFMC and the ASMFC through the specifications process, for use in conjunction with each ACL and ACT, a sector-specific research set-aside, estimates of sector-related discards, a recreational harvest limit, and a commercial quota, along with other measures, as needed, to prevent overages of the applicable specified limits or targets for each sector, as prescribed in the FMP. The measures to be considered by the Monitoring Committee are as follows:


(1) Research quota set from a range of 0 to 3 percent of the maximum allowed to achieve the specified exploitation rate.


(2) The commercial quota for each of the three periods specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for research quota.


(3) Possession limits for the Winter I and Winter II periods, including possession limits that result from potential rollover of quota from Winter I to Winter II. The possession limit is the maximum quantity of scup that is allowed to be landed within a 24-hour period (calendar day).


(4) Percent of landings attained at which the landing limit for the Winter I period will be reduced.


(5) All scup landed for sale in any state during a quota period shall be applied against the coastwide commercial quota for that period, regardless of where the scup were harvested, except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.


(6) Minimum mesh size.


(7) Recreational possession limit set from a range of 0 to 50 scup.


(8) Recreational minimum fish size.


(9) Recreational season.


(10) Restrictions on gear.


(11) Season and area closures in the commercial fishery.


(12) Total allowable landings on an annual basis for a period not to exceed 3 years.


(13) Changes, as appropriate, to the SBRM, including the CV-based performance standard, the means by which discard data are collected/obtained, fishery stratification, the process for prioritizing observer sea-day allocations, reports, and/or industry-funded observers or observer set aside programs.


(14) Modification of existing AM measures and ACT control rules utilized by the Monitoring Committee.


(b) *Specification of fishing measures.* The MAFMC shall review the recommendations of the Monitoring Committee. Based on these recommendations and any public comment, the MAFMC shall recommend to the Regional Administrator measures necessary to prevent overages of the appropriate specified limits or targets for each sector, as prescribed in the FMP. The MAFMC's recommendation must include supporting documentation, as appropriate, concerning the environmental and economic impacts of the recommendations. The Regional Administrator shall review these recommendations and any recommendations of the ASMFC. After such review, NMFS will publish a proposed rule in the _Federal Register_ to implement a commercial quota, specifying the amount of quota allocated to each of the three periods, possession limits for the Winter I and Winter II periods, including possession limits that result from potential rollover of quota from Winter I to Winter II, the percentage of landings attained during the Winter I fishery at which the possession limits will be reduced, a recreational harvest limit, and additional management measures for the commercial and recreational fisheries.


(c) *Distribution of commercial quota.* (1) The annual commercial quota will be allocated into three periods, based on the following percentages:


(2) The commercial quotas for each period will each be distributed to the coastal states from Maine through North Carolina on a coastwide basis.


(d) *Winter I and II commercial quota adjustment procedures.* The Regional Administrator will monitor the harvest of commercial quota for the Winter I period based on dealer reports, state data, and other available information and shall determine the total amount of scup landed during the Winter I period. In any year that the Regional Administrator determines that the landings of scup during Winter I are less than the Winter I quota for that year, he/she shall increase, through publication of a notification in the _Federal Register,_ provided such rule complies with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, the Winter II quota for that year by the amount of the Winter I under-harvest. The Regional Administrator shall also adjust, through publication of a notification in the _Federal Register,_ the Winter II possession limits consistent with the amount of the quota increase, based on the possession limits established through the annual specifications-setting process.


(e) *Research quota.* See ยง 648.21(g).
