# § 648.151   Black sea bass conservation equivalency.

(a) The Regional Administrator has determined that the recreational fishing measures proposed to be implemented by the states of Maine through North Carolina for 2024 are the conservation equivalent of the season, size limits, and possession limit prescribed in §§ 648.146, 648.147(b), and 648.145(a). This determination is based on a recommendation from the Black Sea Bass Board of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission.




(1) Federally permitted vessels subject to the recreational fishing measures of this part, and other recreational fishing vessels harvesting black sea bass in or from the EEZ and subject to the recreational fishing measures of this part, landing black sea bass in a state whose fishery management measures are determined by the Regional Administrator to be conservation equivalent shall not be subject to the more restrictive Federal measures, pursuant to the provisions of § 648.4(b). Those vessels shall be subject to the recreational fishing measures implemented by the state in which they land.


(2) [Reserved]


(b) Federally permitted vessels subject to the recreational fishing measures of this part, and other recreational fishing vessels registered in states and subject to the recreational fishing measures of this part, whose fishery management measures are not determined by the Regional Administrator to be the conservation equivalent of the season, size limits and possession limit prescribed in §§ 648.146, 648.147(b), and 648.145(a), respectively, due to the lack of, or the reversal of, a conservation-equivalent recommendation from the Black Sea Bass Board of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission shall be subject to the following precautionary default measures: Season-June 1 through August 31; minimum size—16 inches (40.64 cm); and possession limit—2 fish.
