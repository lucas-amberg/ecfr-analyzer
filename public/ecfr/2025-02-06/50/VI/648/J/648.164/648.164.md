# ยง 648.164   Bluefish possession restrictions.

(a) *Recreational possession limits.* Any person fishing from a vessel in the EEZ that is not fishing under a bluefish commercial permit shall observe the applicable recreational possession limit. The owner, operator, and crew of a charter or party boat issued a bluefish commercial permit are not subject to the recreational possession limit when not carrying passengers for hire and when the crew size does not exceed five for a party boat and three for a charter boat.


(1) *Private recreational vessels.* Any person fishing from a vessel that is not fishing under a bluefish commercial or charter/party vessel permit issued pursuant to ยง 648.4(a)(8), may land up to three bluefish per day.


(2) *For-hire vessels.* Anglers fishing onboard a for-hire vessel under a bluefish charter/party vessel permit issued pursuant to ยง 648.4(a)(8), may land up to five bluefish per person per day.


(b) *Pooling Catch.* Bluefish harvested by vessels subject to the possession limit with more than one person on board may be pooled in one or more containers. Compliance with the daily possession limit will be determined by dividing the number of bluefish on board by the number of persons on board, other than the captain and the crew. If there is a violation of the possession limit on board a vessel carrying more than one person, the violation shall be deemed to have been committed by the owner and operator of the vessel.
