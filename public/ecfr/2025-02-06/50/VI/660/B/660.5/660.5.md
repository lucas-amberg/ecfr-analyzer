# § 660.5   Shared Ecosystem Component Species.

(a) *General.* The FMPs implemented in this part 660 each contain ecosystem component species specific to each FMP, as well as a group of ecosystem component species shared between all of the FMPs. Ecosystem component species shared between all of the Pacific Fishery Management Council's FMPs, and known collectively as “Shared EC Species,” are:


(1) Round herring (*Etrumeus teres*) and thread herring (*Ophisthonema libertate* and *O. medirastre*).


(2) Mesopelagic fishes of the families *Myctophidae, Bathylagidae, Paralepididae,* and *Gonostomatidae*.


(3) Pacific sand lance (*Ammodytes personatus*)


(4) Pacific saury (*Cololabis saira*).


(5) Silversides (family *Atherinopsidae*).


(6) Smelts of the family *Osmeridae*.


(7) Pelagic squids (families: *Cranchiidae, Gonatidae, Histioteuthidae, Octopoteuthidae, Ommastrephidae* except Humboldt squid [*Dosidicus gigas,*] *Onychoteuthidae,* and *Thysanoteuthidae*).


(b) *Directed commercial fishing for Shared EC Species.* For the purposes of this section, “directed commercial fishing” means that a fishing vessel lands Shared EC Species without landing any species other than Shared EC Species, or lands Shared EC Species with other species and in amounts more than:


(1) 10 mt combined weight of all Shared EC Species from any fishing trip; or


(2) 30 mt combined weight of all Shared EC Species in any calendar year.
