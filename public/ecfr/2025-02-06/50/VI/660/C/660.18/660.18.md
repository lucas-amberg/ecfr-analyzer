Ownership of a provider permit cannot be registered to another individual or entity. The provider permit owner cannot change, substitute, or add individuals or entities as owners of the permit (*i.e.,* cannot change the legal name of the permit owner(s) as given on the permit). Any change in ownership of the provider permit requires the new owner(s) to apply for a provider permit, and is subject to approval by NMFS.
