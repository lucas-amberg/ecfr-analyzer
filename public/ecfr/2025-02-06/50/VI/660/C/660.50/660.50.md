# § 660.50   Pacific Coast treaty Indian fisheries.

(a) *Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribes have treaty rights.* Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribes have treaty rights to harvest groundfish in their usual and accustomed fishing areas in U.S. waters. In 1994, the United States formally recognized that the four Washington coastal treaty Indian tribes (Makah, Quileute, Hoh, and Quinault) have treaty rights to fish for groundfish in the Pacific Ocean, and concluded that, in general terms, the quantification of those rights is 50 percent of the harvestable surplus of groundfish that pass through the tribes U&A fishing areas.


(b) *Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribes.* For the purposes of this part, Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribes means the Hoh Indian Tribe, Makah Indian Tribe, Quileute Indian Tribe and the Quinault Indian Nation.


(c) *Usual and accustomed fishing areas or U&A fishing areas.* The Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribes' U&A fishing areas within the EEZ are set out in § 660.4.


(d) *Procedures.* The rights referred to in paragraph (a) of this section will be implemented by the Secretary, after consideration of the tribal request, the recommendation of the Council, and the comments of the public. The rights will be implemented either through an allocation or set-aside of fish that will be managed by the tribes, or through regulations in this section that will apply specifically to the tribal fisheries.


(1) *Tribal allocations, set-asides, and regulations.* An allocation, set-aside or a regulation specific to the tribes shall be initiated by a written request from a Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe to the Regional Administrator, prior to the first Council meeting in which biennial harvest specifications and management measures are discussed for an upcoming biennial management period. The Secretary generally will announce the annual tribal allocations at the same time as the announcement of the harvest specifications.


(2) *Co-management.* The Secretary recognizes the sovereign status and co-manager role of Indian tribes over shared Federal and tribal fishery resources. Accordingly, the Secretary will develop tribal allocations and regulations under this paragraph in consultation with the affected tribe(s) and, insofar as possible, with tribal consensus.


(e) *Fishing by a member of a Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe.* A member of a Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe fishing under this section and within their U&A fishing area is not subject to the provisions of other sections of subparts C through G of this part.


(1) *Identification.* A valid treaty Indian identification card issued pursuant to 25 CFR part 249, subpart A, is prima facie evidence that the holder is a member of the Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe named on the card.


(2) *Permits.* A limited entry permit described under § 660.25, subpart C is not required for a member of a Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe to fish in a tribal fishery described in paragraph (d) of this section.


(3) *Federal and tribal laws and regulations.* Any member of a Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe must comply with this section, and with any applicable tribal law and regulation, when participating in a tribal groundfish fishery described in this section.


(4) *Fishing outside the U&A fishing area or without a groundfish allocation.* Fishing by a member of a Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribe outside the applicable Indian tribe's U&A fishing area, or for a species of groundfish not covered by an allocation, set-aside, or regulation under this section, is subject to the regulations in the other sections of subpart C through subpart G of this part. Treaty fisheries operating within tribal allocations are prohibited from operating outside the U&A fishing areas described at § 660.4, subpart A.


(f) *Pacific Coast treaty Indian fisheries allocations, harvest guidelines, and set-asides.* Trip limits for certain species were recommended by the Tribes and the Council and are specified in paragraph (g) of this section.


(1) *Arrowtooth flounder.* The Tribal harvest guideline is 2,041 mt per year.


(2) *Big skate.* The Tribal harvest guideline is 15 mt per year.


(3) *Black rockfish off Washington.* (i) Harvest guidelines for commercial harvests of black rockfish by members of the Pacific Coast Indian Tribes using hook-and-line gear will be established biennially for two subsequent 1-year periods for the areas between the U.S.-Canadian border and Cape Alava (48°09.50′ N lat.) and between Destruction Island (47°40′ N lat.) and Leadbetter Point (46°38.17′ N lat.), in accordance with the procedures for implementing harvest specifications and management measures. Pacific Coast treaty Indians fishing for black rockfish in these areas under these harvest guidelines are subject to the provisions in this section, and not to the restrictions in subparts C through G of this part.


(ii) For the commercial harvest of black rockfish off Washington State, a treaty Indian Tribes' harvest guideline is set at 30,000 lb (13,608 kg) for the area north of Cape Alava, WA (48°09.50′ N lat.) and 10,000 lb (4,536 kg) for the area between Destruction Island, WA (47°40′ N lat.) and Leadbetter Point, WA (46°38.17′ N lat.). This harvest guideline applies and is available to the Pacific Coast treaty Indian Tribes. There are no Tribal harvest restrictions for black rockfish in the area between Cape Alava and Destruction Island.
