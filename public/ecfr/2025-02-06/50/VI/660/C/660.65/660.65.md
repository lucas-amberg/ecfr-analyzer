# ยง 660.65   Groundfish harvest specifications.

Harvest specifications include OFLs, ABCs, and the designation of OYs and ACLs. Management measures necessary to keep catch within the ACL include ACTs, HGs, or quotas for species that need individual management, the allocation of fishery HGs between the trawl and non-trawl segments of the fishery, and the allocation of commercial HGs between the open access and limited entry segments of the fishery. These specifications account for fish caught in state ocean waters (0-3 nm (0-5.6 km) offshore), though that fishing activity is governed by the States of Washington, Oregon, and California respectively. Catch of a stock in State waters is taken off the top of the harvest specifications for the stock in the EEZ (3-200 nm (5.6-370.4 km) offshore). Harvest specifications are provided in tables 1a through 2d of this subpart.
