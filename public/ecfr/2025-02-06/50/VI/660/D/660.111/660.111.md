# § 660.111   Trawl fishery—definitions.

These definitions are specific to the limited entry trawl fisheries covered in this subpart. General groundfish definitions are found at § 660.11.


*Accumulation limits* mean the maximum extent of permissible ownership, control or use of a privilege within the trawl rationalization program, and include the following:


(1) *Shorebased IFQ Program*—(i) *Control limits* means the maximum amount of QS or IBQ that a person may own or control, as described at § 660.140(d)(4).


(ii) *Vessel limits* means the maximum amount of QP a vessel can hold, acquire, and/or use during a calendar year, and specify the maximum amount of QP that may be registered to a single vessel during the year (QP Vessel Limit) and, for some species, the maximum amount of unused QP registered to a vessel account at any one time (Unused QP Vessel Limit), as described at § 660.140(e)(4). Compliance with the QP vessel limit (annual limit) is calculated as all QPs transferred in minus all QPs transferred out of the vessel account.


(2) *MS Co-op Program.* (i) MS/CV permit ownership limit means the maximum amount of catch history assignment that a person may own, no more than 20 percent of the MS sector's allocation of Pacific whiting, as described at § 660.150(g)(3)(i).


(ii) Catcher vessel usage limit means the maximum amount of the annual mothership sector Pacific whiting allocation that a vessel may catch, no more than 30 percent, as described at § 660.150(g)(3)(ii).


*Block area closures* or *BACs* are a type of groundfish conservation area, defined at § 660.11, bounded on the north and south by commonly used geographic coordinates, defined at § 660.11, and on the east and west by the EEZ, and boundary lines approximating depth contours, defined with latitude and longitude coordinates at §§ 660.71 through 660.74 (10 fm (18 m) through 250 fm (457 m)), and § 660.76 (700 fm (1,280 m)). BACs may be implemented or modified as routine management measures, per regulations at § 660.60(c). BACs may be implemented in the EEZ seaward of Washington, Oregon, and California for vessels using limited entry bottom trawl and/or midwater trawl gear. BACs may be implemented within Tribal Usual and Accustomed fishing areas but may only apply to non-Tribal vessels. BACs may close areas to specific trawl gear types (*e.g.,* closed for midwater trawl, bottom trawl, or bottom trawl unless using selective flatfish trawl) and/or specific programs within the trawl fishery (*e.g.,* Pacific whiting fishery or MS Co-op Program). BACs may vary in their geographic boundaries and duration. Their geographic boundaries, applicable gear type(s) and/or specific trawl fishery program, and effective dates will be announced in the _Federal Register._ BACs may have a specific termination date as described in the _Federal Register_ or may be in effect until modified. BACs that are in effect until modified by Council recommendation and subsequent NMFS action are set out in tables 1a (North) and 1a (South) of this subpart.

*Mothership (MS) Co-op Program or MS sector* refers to the fishery described at § 660.150, subpart D, and includes both the co-op and non-cooperative fisheries. The MS Co-op Program is composed of motherships with MS permits and catcher vessels registered to a limited entry permit with an MS/CV endorsement and a valid declaration for limited entry, midwater trawl, Pacific whiting mothership sector.

*Pacific whiting IFQ fishery* is composed of vessels on Pacific whiting IFQ trips.


*Pacific whiting IFQ trip* means a trip in which a vessel uses midwater groundfish trawl gear during the dates of the Pacific whiting primary season to target Pacific whiting, and Pacific whiting constitutes 50 percent or more of the catch by weight at landing as reported on the state landing receipt. Vessels on Pacific whiting IFQ trips must have a valid declaration for limited entry midwater trawl, Pacific whiting shorebased IFQ.


*Quota pounds (QP)* means the quotas, expressed in round weight of fish, that are issued annually to each QS permit owner in the Shorebased IFQ Program based on the amount of QS they own and the amount of fish allocated to the Shorebased IFQ Program. QP have the same species/species group and area designations as the QS from which they are issued.


*Quota share (QS)* means the amount of fishing quota for an individual species/species group and area expressed as a percentage of the annual allocation of fish to the Shorebased IFQ Program. The QS is used as the basis for the annual calculation and allocation of a QS permit owner's QP in the Shorebased IFQ Program. Both QS and IBQ may be listed on a QS permit and in the associated QS account. Species for which QS will be issued for the Shorebased IFQ Program are listed at § 660.140, subpart D.


*Salmon Mitigation Plan (SMP)* means a voluntary agreement amongst a group of at least three vessels in the MS Co-op Program, C/P Co-op Program, or Pacific whiting IFQ fishery to manage Chinook salmon bycatch, approved by NMFS under § 660.113(e).
