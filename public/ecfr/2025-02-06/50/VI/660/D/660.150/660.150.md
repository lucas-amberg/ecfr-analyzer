# § 660.150   Mothership (MS) Co-op Program.

(a) *General.* The MS Co-op Program is a general term to describe the limited access program that applies to eligible harvesters and processors in the mothership sector of the Pacific whiting at-sea trawl fishery. Eligible harvesters and processors, including co-op and non-cooperative fishery participants, must meet the requirements set forth in this section of the Pacific Coast groundfish regulations. Each year a vessel registered to an MS/CV-endorsed permit may fish in either the co-op or non-cooperative portion of the MS Co-op Program, but not both. In addition to the requirements of this section, the MS Co-op Program is subject to the following groundfish regulations of subparts C and D of this part:


(1) Pacific whiting seasons § 660.131(b), subpart D.


(2) Area restrictions specified for midwater trawl gear used to harvest Pacific whiting fishery specified at § 660.131(c), Subpart D for GCAs, RCAs, Salmon Conservation Zones, BRAs, and EFHCAs.


(3) Regulations set out in the following sections of subpart C: § 660.11 Definitions, § 660.12 Prohibitions, § 660.13 Recordkeeping and reporting, § 660.14 VMS requirements, § 660.15 Equipment requirements, § 660.16 Groundfish Observer Program, § 660.20 Vessel and gear identification, § 660.25 Permits, § 660.55 Allocations, § 660.60 Specifications and management measures, § 660.65 Groundfish harvest specifications, and §§ 660.70 through 660.79 Closed areas.


(4) Regulations set out in the following sections of subpart D: § 660.111 Trawl fishery definitions, § 660.112 Trawl fishery prohibitions, § 660.113 Trawl fishery recordkeeping and reporting, § 660.115 Trawl fishery cost recovery program, § 660.120 Trawl fishery crossover provisions, § 660.130 Trawl fishery management measures, and § 660.131 Pacific whiting fishery management measures.


(5) The MS Co-op Program may be restricted or closed as a result of projected overages within the MS Co-op Program, the C/P Co-op Program, or the Shorebased IFQ Program. As determined necessary by the Regional Administrator, area restrictions, season closures, or other measures will be used to prevent the trawl sectors in aggregate or the individual trawl sector (Shorebased IFQ, MS Co-op, or C/P Co-op) from exceeding an ACL, ACT, or formal allocation specified in the PCGFMP or regulation at § 660.55, subpart C, or §§ 660.140, 660.150, or 660.160, subpart D.


(b) *Participation requirements and responsibilities*—(1) *Mothership vessels*—(i) *Mothership vessel participation requirements.* A vessel is eligible to receive and process catch as a mothership in the MS Co-op Program if:


(A) The vessel is registered to an MS permit; and


(B) The vessel is not used to fish as a catcher vessel in the mothership sector of the Pacific whiting fishery in the same calendar year.


(ii) *Mothership vessel responsibilities.* The owner and operator of a mothership vessel must:


(A) *Recordkeeping and reporting.* Maintain a valid declaration as specified at § 660.13(d); maintain records as specified at § 660.113(a); and maintain and submit all records and reports specified at § 660.113(c) including, economic data, scale tests records, cease fishing reports, and cost recovery.


(B) *Observers.* As specified at paragraph (j) of this section, procure observer services, maintain the appropriate level of coverage, and meet the vessel responsibilities.


(C) *Catch weighing requirements.* The owner and operator of a mothership vessel must:


(*1*) Ensure that all catch is weighed in its round form on a NMFS-approved scale that meets the requirements described in section § 660.15(b);


(*2*) Provide a NMFS-approved platform scale, belt scale, and test weights that meet the requirements described in section § 660.15(b).


(D) *Cost recovery program.* Collect and remit to NMFS cost recovery program fees as specified at § 660.115.


(2) *Mothership catcher vessels*—(i) *Mothership catcher vessel participation requirements*—(A) A vessel is eligible to harvest in the MS Co-op Program if the following conditions are met:


(*1*) If the vessel is used to fish as a mothership catcher vessel for a permitted MS co-op, the vessel is registered to a limited entry permit with a trawl endorsement and NMFS has been notified that the vessel is authorized to fish for the co-op.


(*2*) If the vessel is used to harvest fish in the non-cooperative fishery, the vessel is registered to an MS/CV-endorsed limited entry permit.


(*3*) The vessel does not catch more than 30 percent of the Pacific whiting allocation for the mothership sector.


(B) [Reserved]


(ii) *Mothership catcher vessel responsibilities*—(A) *Observers.* As specified at paragraph (j) of this section, procure observer services, maintain the appropriate level of coverage, and meet the vessel responsibilities.


(B) *Recordkeeping and reporting.* Maintain a valid declaration as specified at § 660.13(d), subpart C; and, maintain and submit all records and reports specified at § 660.113(c) including, economic data and scale tests records, if applicable.


(C) *Cost recovery program.* Vessel must pay cost recovery program fees, as specified at § 660.115.


(3) *MS co-ops*—(i) *MS co-op participation requirements.* For a MS co-op to participate in the Pacific whiting mothership sector fishery it must:


(A) Be issued a MS co-op permit;


(B) Be composed of MS/CV-endorsed limited entry permit owners;


(C) Be formed voluntarily;


(D) Be a legally recognized entity that represents its members;


(E) Designate an individual as a co-op manager; and


(F) Include at least 20 percent of all MS/CV-endorsed permits as members. The co-op membership percentage will be interpreted by rounding to the nearest whole permit (*i.e.*, less than 0.5 rounds down and 0.5 and greater rounds up).


(ii) *MS co-op responsibilities.* A MS co-op is responsible for:


(A) Applying for and being registered to a MS co-op permit;


(B) Organizing and coordinating harvest activities of vessels authorized to fish for the co-op;


(C) Reassigning catch history assignments for use by co-op members;


(D) Organizing and coordinating the transfer and leasing of catch allocations with other permitted co-ops through inter-co-op agreements;


(E) Monitoring harvest activities and enforcing the catch limits of co-op members;


(F) Submitting an annual report.


(G) Having a designated co-op manager. The designated co-op manager must:


(*1*) Serve as the contact person between NMFS, the Council, and other co-ops;


(*2*) Be responsible for the annual distribution of catch and bycatch allocations among co-op members;


(*3*) Oversee reassignment of catch allocations within the co-op;


(*4*) Oversee inter-co-op catch allocation reassignments;


(*5*) Prepare and submit an annual report on behalf of the co-op;


(*6*) Be authorized to receive or respond to any legal process in which the co-op is involved; and


(*7*) Notify NMFS if the co-op dissolves.


(iii) *MS co-op compliance and joint/several liability.* An MS co-op must comply with the provisions of this section. The MS co-op, member limited entry permit owners, and owners and operators of vessels registered to member limited entry permits, are jointly and severally responsible for compliance with the provisions of this section. Pursuant to 15 CFR part 904, each MS co-op, member permit owner, and owner and operator of a vessel registered to a co-op member permit may be charged jointly and severally for violations of the provisions of this section. For purposes of enforcement, an MS co-op is a legal entity that can be subject to NOAA enforcement action for violations of the provisions of this section.


(c) *MS Co-op Program species and allocations*—(1) *MS Co-op Program species.* All species other than Pacific whiting are managed with set-asides for the MS and C/P Co-op Programs, as described in the biennial specifications.


(2) *Annual mothership sector sub-allocations.* Annual allocation amount(s) will be determined using the following procedure:


(i) *MS/CV catch history assignments.* Catch history assignments will be based on catch history using the following methodology:


(A) *Pacific whiting catch history assignment.* Each MS/CV endorsement's associated catch history assignment of Pacific whiting will be annually allocated to a single permitted MS co-op or to the non-coop fishery. If multiple MS/CV endorsements and their associated CHAs are registered to a limited entry permit, that permit may be simultaneously registered to more than one MS co-op or to both a co-op(s) and non-cooperative fishery. Once assigned to a permitted MS co-op or to the non-cooperative fishery, each MS/CV endorsement's catch history assignment remains with that permitted MS co-op or non-cooperative fishery for that calendar year. When the mothership sector allocation is established, the information for the conversion of catch history assignment to pounds will be made available to the public through a _Federal Register_ announcement and/or public notice and/or the NMFS website. The amount of whiting from the catch history assignment will be issued to the nearest whole pound using standard rounding rules (*i.e.,* less than 0.5 rounds down and 0.5 and greater rounds up).


(*1*) In years where the Pacific whiting harvest specification is known by the start of the mothership sector primary whiting season specified at § 660.131(b)(2)(iii)(B), allocation for Pacific whiting will be made by the start of the season.


(*2*) In years where the Pacific whiting harvest specification is not known by the start of the mothership sector primary whiting season specified at § 660.131(b)(2)(iii)(B), NMFS will issue Pacific whiting allocations in two parts. Before the start of the primary whiting season, NMFS will allocate Pacific whiting based on the MS Co-op Program allocation percent multiplied by the lower end of the range of potential harvest specifications for Pacific whiting for that year. After the final Pacific whiting harvest specifications are established, NMFS will allocate any additional amounts of Pacific whiting to the MS Co-op Program.


(B) *Non-whiting groundfish species catch*—(*1*) At-sea set-asides of non-whiting groundfish species will be managed on an annual basis unless there is a risk of a harvest specification being exceeded, unforeseen impact on other fisheries, or conservation concerns, in which case inseason action may be taken. Set asides may be adjusted through the biennial specifications and management measures process as necessary.


*(2)* Groundfish species not addressed in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B)(*1*) of this section, will be managed on an annual basis unless there is a risk of a harvest specification being exceeded, unforeseen impact on other fisheries, or conservation concerns, in which case inseason action may be taken.


(*3*) Annually a specified amount of the Pacific halibut will be held in reserve as a shared set-aside for bycatch in the at-sea Pacific whiting fisheries and the shorebased trawl sector south of 40°10′ N lat.


(C) *Rounding rules and MS/CV allocations.* Rounding rules may affect distribution of the MS Co-op Program allocations among the catch history assignments for individual MS/CV-endorsed permits. NMFS will distribute such allocations to the maximum extent practicable, not to exceed the total allocation.


(ii) *Annual co-op allocations*—(A) *Pacific whiting.* Each permitted MS co-op is authorized to harvest a quantity of Pacific whiting that is based on the sum of the catch history assignments for each member MS/CV-endorsed permit identified in the NMFS-accepted co-op agreement for a given calendar year. Other limited entry permits registered to vessels that will fish for the co-op do not bring catch allocation to a permitted MS co-op.


(B) *Single MS/CV Co-op Fishery.* If all MS/CV-endorsed permits are members of a single co-op in a given year and there is not a non-cooperative fishery, then NMFS will allocate 100 percent of the MS Co-op Program allocation to that co-op.


(iii) *Annual non-cooperative allocation*—(A) *Pacific whiting.* The non-cooperative whiting fishery is authorized to harvest a quantity of Pacific whiting that is remaining in the mothership sector annual allocation after the deduction of all co-op allocations.


(B) *Announcement of the non-cooperative fishery allocations.* Information on the amount of Pacific whiting and non-whiting groundfish with allocations that will be made available to the non-cooperative fishery when the final Pacific whiting specifications for the mothership sector is established and will be announced to the public through a _Federal Register_ announcement and/or public notice and/or the NMFS website.


(3) *Reaching an allocation or sub-allocation.* When the mothership sector Pacific whiting allocation, or Pacific whiting sub-allocation is reached or is projected to be reached, the following action may be taken:


(i) Further harvesting, receiving or at-sea processing by a mothership or catcher vessel in the mothership sector is prohibited when the mothership sector Pacific whiting allocation is projected to be reached. No additional unprocessed groundfish may be brought on board after at-sea processing is prohibited, but a mothership may continue to process catch that was on board before at-sea processing was prohibited. Pacific whiting may not be taken and retained, possessed, or landed by a catcher vessel participating in the mothership sector.


(ii) When a permitted MS co-op sub-allocation of Pacific whiting-is reached, further harvesting or receiving of groundfish by vessels fishing in the permitted MS co-op must cease, unless the permitted MS co-op is operating under an NMFS-accepted inter-co-op agreement.


(iii) When the non-cooperative fishery sub-allocation of Pacific whiting is projected to be reached, further harvesting or receiving of groundfish by vessels fishing in the non-cooperative fishery must cease.


(4) [Reserved]


(5) *Announcements.* The Regional Administrator will announce in the _Federal Register_ when the mothership sector allocation of Pacific whiting is reached, or is projected to be reached, and specify the appropriate action. In order to prevent exceeding an allocation and to avoid underutilizing the resource, prohibitions against further taking and retaining, receiving, or at-sea processing of Pacific whiting may be made effective immediately by actual notice to fishers and processors, by email, internet, phone, fax, letter, press release, and/or USCG Notice to Mariners (monitor channel 16 VHF), followed by publication in the _Federal Register,_ in which instance public comment will be sought for a reasonable period of time thereafter.


(6) *Redistribution of annual allocation*—(i) *Between permitted MS co-ops (inter-co-op).* (A) Through an inter-co-op agreement, the designated co-op managers of permitted MS co-ops may distribute Pacific whiting allocations among one or more permitted MS co-ops.


(B) In the case of a MS co-op failure during the Pacific whiting primary season for the mothership sector, unused allocation associated with the catch history will not be available for harvest by the co-op that failed, by any former members of the co-op that failed, or any other MS co-op for the remainder of that calendar year.


(*1*) *Between the MS co-op and non-cooperative fisheries.* Pacific whiting may not be redistributed between the co-op and non-cooperative fisheries.


(*2*) *Between Pacific whiting sectors.* Pacific whiting may not be redistributed between the mothership sector and catcher/processor sector. Whiting may not be redistributed to the Shorebased IFQ Program.


(d) *MS co-op permit and agreement*—(1) *Eligibility and registration*—(i) *Eligibility.* To be an eligible co-op entity a group of MS/CV-endorsed permit owners (co-op members) must be a recognized entity under the laws of the United States or the laws of a State and represent all of the co-op members.


(ii) *Annual registration and deadline.* Each year, a co-op entity intending to participate as a co-op under the MS Co-op Program must submit an application for a MS co-op permit between January 17 and March 17 of the year in which it intends to fish. NMFS will not consider any applications received after March 17. An MS co-op permit expires on December 31 of the year in which it was issued.


(iii) *Application for MS co-op permit.* The designated co-op manager, on behalf of the co-op entity, must submit a complete application form and include each of the items listed in paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(A) of this section. Only complete applications will be considered for issuance of a MS co-op permit. An application will not be considered complete if any required application fees and annual co-op reports have not been received by NMFS. NMFS may request additional supplemental documentation as necessary to make a determination of whether to approve or disapprove the application. Application forms and instruction are available on the NMFS West Coast Region (WCR) website (*https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/permit/groundfish-mothership-cooperative-permit*) or by request from NMFS. The designated co-op manager must sign the application acknowledging the responsibilities of a designated co-op manager defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. For permit owners with more than one MS/CV endorsement and associated CHA, paragraph (g)(2)(iv)(D) of this section specifies how to join an MS co-op(s).


(A) *Co-op agreement.* Signed copies of the co-op agreement must be submitted to NMFS before the co-op is authorized to engage in fishing activities. A co-op agreement must include all of the information listed in this paragraph to be considered a complete co-op agreement. NMFS will only review complete co-op agreements. A co-op agreement will not be accepted unless it includes all of the required information; the descriptive items listed in this paragraph appear to meet the stated purpose; and information submitted is correct and accurate.


(*1*) *Co-op agreement contents.* Each co-op agreement must be signed by all of the co-op members (MS/CV-endorsed permit owners) and include the following information:


(*i*) A list of all vessels and permit owners participating in the co-op and their share of the allocated catch history assignments which must match the amount distributed to individual permit owners by NMFS.


(*ii*) All MS/CV-endorsed limited entry member permits identified by permit number.


(*iii*) A clause indicting that each member MS/CV-endorsed permit's catch history assignment is based on the catch history assignment calculation by NMFS used for distribution to the co-op.


(*iv*) A description of the cooperative's plan to adequately monitor and account for the catch of Pacific whiting and non-whiting groundfish, and to monitor and account for the catch of prohibited species.


(*v*) A clause stating that if a permit is registered to a new permit owner during the effective period of the co-op agreement, any new owners of that member permit would be co-op members required to comply with membership restrictions in the co-op agreement.


(*vi*) A description of the cooperative's enforcement and penalty provisions adequate to maintain catch of Pacific whiting and non-whiting groundfish within the allocations.


(*vii*) A description of measures to reduce catch of overfished species.


(*viii*) A clause describing the co-op manager's responsibility for managing inter-co-op reassignments of catch history assignment, should any occur.


(*ix*) A clause describing how the annual report will be produced to document the cooperative's catch, bycatch data, inseason catch history reassignments and any other significant activities undertaken by the co-op during the year, and the submission deadlines for that report.


(*x*) Identification of the designated co-op manager.


(*xi*) Provisions that prohibit member permit owners that have incurred legal sanctions that prevent them from fishing groundfish in the Council region from fishing in the co-op.


(*2*) *Inter-co-op agreement.* The co-op entity must provide, at the time of annual application, copies of any inter-co-op agreement(s) into which the co-op has entered. Such agreements must incorporate and honor the provisions of the individual co-op agreements for each co-op that is a party to the inter-co-op agreement. Inter-co-op agreements are specified at paragraph (e) of this section.


(B) *Acceptance of a co-op agreement*—(*1*) If NMFS does not accept the co-op agreement, the co-op permit application will be returned to the applicant with a letter stating the reasons the co-op agreement was not accepted by NMFS.


(*2*) Co-op agreements that are not accepted may be resubmitted for review by sufficiently addressing the deficiencies identified in the NMFS letter and resubmitting the entire co-op permit application by the date specified in the NMFS letter.


(*3*) An accepted co-op agreement that was submitted with the MS co-op permit application and for which a MS co-op permit was issued will remain in place through the end of the calendar year. The designated co-op manager must resubmit a complete co-op agreement to NMFS consistent with the co-op agreement contents described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(A)(*1*) of this section if there is a material change to the co-op agreement.


(*4*) Within 7 calendar days following a material change, the designated co-op manager must notify NMFS of the material change. Within 30 calendar days, the designated co-op manger must submit to NMFS the revised co-op agreement with a letter that describes such changes. NMFS will review the material changes and provide a letter to the co-op manager that either accepts the changes as given or does not accept the revised co-op agreement with a letter stating the reasons that it was not accepted by NMFS. The co-op may resubmit the co-op agreement with further revisions to the material changes responding to NMFS concerns.


(iv) *Effective date of MS co-op permit.* A MS co-op permit will be effective upon the date approved by NMFS and will allow fishing from the start of the MS sector primary whiting season until the end of the calendar year or until one or more of the following events occur, whichever comes first:


(A) NMFS permanently closes the mothership sector fishing season for the year or a specific MS co-op or the designated co-op manager notifies NMFS that the co-op has completed fishing for the calendar year,


(B) The co-op has reached its Pacific whiting allocation,


(C) A material change to the co-op agreement has occurred and the designated co-op manager failed to notify NMFS within 7 calendar days of the material change and submit to NMFS the revised co-op agreement with a letter that describes such changes within 30 calendar days, or


(D) NMFS has determined that a co-op failure occurred.


(2) *Initial administrative determination.* For all complete applications, NMFS will issue an IAD if the application is disapproved. An approved application will result in issuance of the permit. If disapproved, the IAD will provide the reasons for this determination. The IAD for a MS co-op permit follows the same requirement as specified for limited entry permits at § 660.25(g)(4)(ii); if the applicant does not appeal the IAD within the 30 calendar days, the IAD becomes the final decision of the Regional Administrator acting on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce.


(3) *Appeals.* An appeal to a MS co-op permit action follows the same process as the general permit appeals process defined at § 660.25(g), subpart C.


(4) *Fees.* The Regional Administrator is authorized to charge fees for administrative costs associated with the issuance of a MS co-op permit consistent with the provisions given at § 660.25(f), subpart C.


(e) *Inter-co-op agreements*—(1) *General.* Permitted MS co-ops may voluntarily enter into inter-co-op agreements for the purpose of sharing permitted MS co-op allocations of Pacific whiting and allocated non-whiting groundfish. If two or more permitted MS co-ops enter into an inter-co-op agreement, the inter-co-op agreement must incorporate and honor the provisions of each permitted MS co-op subject to the inter-co-op agreement.


(2) *Submission of inter-co-op agreements.* Inter-co-op agreements must be submitted to NMFS for acceptance.


(3) *Inter-co-op agreement review process.* Each designated co-op manager must submit a copy of the inter-co-op agreement signed by both designated co-op managers for review. Complete co-op agreements containing all items listed under paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(A)(*1*) will be reviewed by NMFS.


(f) *Mothership (MS) permit.*

(1) *General.* Any vessel that processes or receives deliveries as a mothership processor in the Pacific whiting fishery mothership sector must be registered to an MS permit. A vessel registered to an MS permit may receive fish from a vessel that fishes in an MS co-op and/or may receive fish from a vessel that fishes in the non-cooperative fishery at the same time or during the same year.


(i) *Vessel size endorsement.* An MS permit does not have a vessel size endorsement. The endorsement provisions at § 660.25(b)(3)(iii), subpart C, do not apply to an MS permit.


(ii) *Restriction on C/P vessels operating as motherships.* Restrictions on a vessel registered to a limited entry permit with a C/P endorsement operating as a mothership are specified at § 660.160, subpart D.


(2) *Renewal, change of permit ownership, or vessel registration*—(i) *Renewal.* An MS permit must be renewed annually consistent with the limited entry permit regulations given at § 660.25(b)(4). If a vessel registered to the MS permit will operate as a mothership in the year for which the permit is renewed, the permit owner must make a declaration as part of the permit renewal that while participating in the whiting fishery it will operate solely as a mothership during the calendar year to which its limited entry permit applies. Any such declaration is binding on the vessel for the calendar year, even if the permit is registered to a different permit owner during the year, unless it is rescinded in response to a written request from the permit owner. Any request to rescind a declaration must be made by the permit owner and granted in writing by the Regional Administrator before any unprocessed whiting has been taken on board the vessel that calendar year.


(ii) *Change of permit ownership.* An MS permit is subject to the limited entry permit change in permit ownership regulations given at § 660.25(b)(4), subpart C.


(iii) *Change of vessel registration.* An MS permit is subject to the limited entry permit change of vessel registration regulations given at § 660.25(b)(4), subpart C.


(3) *Appeals.* An appeal to an MS permit action follows the same process as the general permit appeals process defined at § 660.25(g), subpart C.


(4) *Fees.* The Regional Administrator is authorized to charge fees for administrative costs associated with the issuance of an MS permit consistent with the provisions given at § 660.25(f), Subpart C.


(5) *Cost recovery.* The owner of a vessel registered to an MS permit, the operator of a vessel registered to an MS permit, and the owner of the MS permit registered to that vessel, are considered to be the fish buyer as defined at § 660.111, and must comply with the cost recovery program specified at § 660.115.


(g) *Mothership catcher vessel (MS/CV)—endorsed permit*—(1) *General.* Any vessel that delivers whiting to a mothership processor in the Pacific whiting fishery mothership sector must be registered to an MS/CV-endorsed permit, except that a vessel registered to limited entry trawl permit without an MS/CV or C/P endorsement may fish for a co-op if authorized by the co-op. Within the MS Co-op Program, an MS/CV-endorsed permit may participate in an MS co-op or in the non-cooperative fishery. An MS/CV-endorsed permit is a limited entry permit and is subject to the limited entry permit provisions given at § 660.25(b), subpart C.


(i) *Catch history assignment.* NMFS will assign a catch history assignment to each MS/CV-endorsed permit. The catch history assignment is based on the catch history in the Pacific whiting mothership sector during the qualifying years of 1994 through 2003. The catch history assignment is expressed as a percentage of Pacific whiting of the total mothership sector allocation as described at paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. Catch history assignments will be issued to the nearest whole pound using standard rounding rules (*i.e.*, decimal amounts from zero up to 0.5 round down and 0.5 up to 1.0 round up).


(ii) *Pacific whiting mothership sector allocation.* The catch history assignment allocation accrues to the co-op to which the MS/CV-endorsed permit is tied through private agreement, or will be assigned to the non-cooperative fishery if the MS/CV-endorsed permit does not participate in the co-op fishery.


(iii) *MS/CV endorsement and CHA non-severable.* Subject to the regulations at paragraph (g)(2)(iv) and (v) of this section, an MS/CV endorsement and its associated CHA are permanently linked together as originally issued by NMFS and cannot be divided or registered separately to another limited entry trawl permit. An MS/CV endorsement and its associated CHA must be registered to a limited entry trawl permit and any change in endorsement registration must be to another limited entry trawl permit.


(iv) *Restrictions on processing for MS/CV-endorsed permits.* A vessel registered to an MS/CV-endorsed permit in a given year shall not engage in processing of Pacific whiting during that year.


(2) *Renewal, change of permit owner, vessel registration, or combination*—(i) *Renewal.* An MS/CV-endorsed permit must be renewed annually consistent with the limited entry permit regulations given at § 660.25(b)(4). During renewal, all MS/CV-endorsed limited entry permit owners must make a preliminary declaration regarding their intent to participate in the co-op or non-co-op portion of the MS Co-op Program for the following year. MS/CV-endorsed permits not obligated to a permitted MS co-op by March 17 of the fishing year will be assigned to the non-co-op fishery. For an MS/CV-endorsed permit that is not renewed, the following occurs:


(A) For the first year after the permit is not renewed, the permit will be extinguished, and the catch history assignment from that permit will be assigned to the non-cooperative fishery.


(B) In the year after the permit is extinguished (the second year after the permit is not renewed), the catch history assignment from that permit will be redistributed proportionally to all valid MS/CV-endorsed permits.


(ii) *Change of permit ownership.* An MS/CV-endorsed permit is subject to the limited entry permit change in permit ownership regulations given at § 660.25(b)(4), subpart C.


(iii) *Change of vessel registration.* An MS/CV-endorsed permit is subject to the limited entry permit change of vessel registration regulations given at § 660.25(b)(4), subpart C.


(iv) *Change in MS/CV endorsement registration.* As specified at § 660.25(b)(3)(v), each MS/CV endorsement has an associated CHA that is permanently linked as originally issued by NMFS and cannot be divided or registered separately to another limited entry trawl permit. An MS/CV endorsement and associated CHA must be registered to a limited entry trawl permit and any change in MS/CV endorsement registration must be to another limited entry trawl permit. Any change in MS/CV endorsement registration will be registered separately on the limited entry trawl permit. An MS/CV endorsement and its associated CHA cannot be registered to any other person other than the specified owner of the limited entry trawl permit to which it is registered.


(A) *Multiple MS/CV endorsements on a limited entry trawl permit.* Multiple MS/CV endorsements and associated CHAs may be registered to a single limited entry trawl permit. If multiple endorsements are registered to a single limited entry trawl permit, the whiting CHA amount (expressed as a percent) will remain in the amount that it was originally issued by NMFS and will not be combined as a single larger CHA, unless two or more MS/CV-endorsed permits are combined for purposes of increasing the size endorsement, as specified at § 660.25(b)(4)(ii)(B). Any change in MS/CV endorsement registration may be disapproved if the person owning the limited entry trawl permit has aggregate CHA amounts in excess of the accumulation limits specified at paragraph (g)(3) of this section.


(B) *Application.* NMFS will begin accepting applications for a change in MS/CV endorsement registration beginning September 1, 2014. A request for a change in MS/CV endorsement registration must be made between September 1 and December 31 of each year. Any transfer of MS/CV endorsement and its associated CHA to another limited entry trawl permit must be requested using a Change in Registration of a Mothership/Catcher Vessel Endorsement/Catch History Assignment Application form and the permit owner or an authorized representative of the permit owner must certify that the application is true and correct by signing and dating the form. In addition, the form must be notarized, and the permit owner selling the MS/CV endorsement and its CHA must provide the sale price of the MS/CV endorsement and its associated CHA. If any assets in addition to the MS/CV endorsement and its associated CHA are included in the sale price, those assets must be itemized and described.


(C) *Effective date.* Any change in MS/CV endorsement registration from one limited entry trawl permit to another limited entry trawl permit will be effective on January 1 in the year following the application period.


(D) A limited entry trawl permit owner with multiple MS/CV-endorsements and associated CHA on a single permit may assign each distinct MS/CV endorsement and catch history assignment separately to co-op(s) or the non-cooperative fishery. In such cases, as part of the co-op permit application process, specified at paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section, the permit owner must specify on the co-op permit application form which MS/CV endorsement and associated CHA is specifically registered to a particular co-op.


(v) *Combination.* An MS/CV-endorsed permit may be combined with one or more other limited entry trawl permits; the resulting permit will be a single permit with an increased size endorsement. If the MS/CV-endorsed permit is combined with another limited entry trawl-endorsed permit other than a C/P-endorsed permit, the resulting permit will be MS/CV-endorsed. If an MS/CV-endorsed permit is combined with a C/P-endorsed permit, the resulting permit will be exclusively a C/P-endorsed permit, and will not have an MS/CV endorsement. If an MS/CV-endorsed permit is combined with another MS/CV-endorsed permit, the combined catch history assignment of the permit(s) will be added to the active permit (the permit remaining after combination) and the other permit will be retired. If a trawl permit has more than one MS/CV endorsements and it is combined with a non C/P-endorsed trawl permit with no such endorsements, the MS/CV endorsements on the resulting permit will be maintained as separate endorsements on the resulting permit. NMFS will not approve a permit combination if it results in a person exceeding the accumulation limits specified at paragraph (g)(3) of this section. Any request to combine permits is subject to the provision provided at § 660.25(b), including the combination formula for resulting size endorsements.


(vi) *One-time request to undo a permit combination.* If two or more MS/CV-endorsed permits have been combined before January 1, 2012 for purposes of increasing the vessel's size endorsement, a permit owner of the resulting combined permit will have until February 29, 2012 to undo that permit combination. The permit owner must submit a letter to NMFS requesting such action. The letter must be postmarked or hand-delivered to NMFS by the deadline.


(3) *Accumulation limits*—(i) *MS/CV-endorsed permit ownership limit.* No person shall own MS/CV-endorsed permits for which the collective Pacific whiting allocation total is greater than 20 percent of the total mothership sector allocation. For purposes of determining accumulation limits, NMFS requires that permit owners submit a complete trawl ownership interest form for the permit owner as part of annual renewal of an MS/CV-endorsed permit. An ownership interest form will also be required whenever a new permit owner obtains an MS/CV-endorsed permit as part of a request for a change in permit ownership. Accumulation limits will be determined by calculating the percentage of ownership interest a person has in any MS/CV-endorsed permit and the amount of the Pacific whiting catch history assignment given on the permit. Determination of ownership interest will be subject to the individual and collective rule.


(A) *Ownership—Individual and collective rule.* The Pacific whiting catch history assignment that applies to a person's accumulation limit will include:


(*1*) The catch history assignment on any MS/CV-endorsed permit owned by that person, and


(*2*) That portion of the catch history assignment on any MS/CV-endorsed permit owned by an entity in which that person has an economic or financial interest, where the person's share of interest in that entity will determine the portion of that entity's catch history assignment that counts toward the person's limit.


(B) [Reserved]


(C) *Trawl identification of ownership interest form.* Any person that owns a limited entry trawl permit and that is applying for or renewing an MS/CV endorsement shall document those persons that have an ownership interest in the permit greater than or equal to 2 percent. This ownership interest must be documented with the SFD via the Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form. SFD will not issue an MS/CV endorsement unless the Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form has been completed. NMFS may request additional information of the applicant as necessary to verify compliance with accumulation limits. Further, if SFD discovers through review of the Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form that a person owns or controls more than the accumulation limits, the person will be subject to divestiture provisions specified in paragraph (g)(3)(i)(D) of this section.


(D) *Divestiture.* For MS/CV-endorsed permit owners that are found to exceed the accumulation limits during the initial issuance of MS/CV-endorsed permits, an adjustment period will be provided during which they will have to completely divest of ownership in permits that exceed the accumulation limits. Any person that NMFS determines, as a result of the initial issuance of MS/CV-endorsed permits, to own in excess of 20 percent of the total catch history assignment in the MS Co-op Program applying the individual and collective rule described at § 660.150(g)(3)(i)(A) will be allowed to receive such permit(s), but must divest themselves of the excess ownership by August 31, 2016. Owners of such permit(s) may receive and use the MS/CV-endorsed permit(s), up to the time their divestiture is completed. After August 31, 2016, any MS/CV-endorsed permits owned by a person (including any person who has ownership interest in the owner named on the permit) in excess of the accumulation limits will not be issued (renewed) until the permit owner complies with the accumulation limits.


(ii) *Catcher vessel usage limit.* No vessel may catch more than 30 percent of the mothership sector's whiting allocation.


(4) *Appeals.* An appeal to an MS/CV-endorsed permit action follows the same process as the general permit appeals process defined at § 660.25(g), subpart C.


(5) *Fees.* The Regional Administrator is authorized to charge a fee for administrative costs associated with the issuance of an MS/CV-endorsed permit, as provided at § 660.25(f), subpart C.


(6) *Application requirements and initial issuance for MS/CV endorsement*—(i) *Eligibility criteria for MS/CV endorsement.* Only a current trawl limited entry permit with a qualifying history of Pacific whiting deliveries in the MS Pacific whiting sector is eligible to receive an MS/CV endorsement. Any past catch history associated with the current limited entry trawl permit accrues to the permit. If a trawl limited entry permit is eligible to receive both a C/P endorsement and an MS/CV endorsement, the permit owner must choose which endorsement to apply for (*i.e.,* the owner of such a permit may not receive both a C/P and an MS/CV endorsement). NMFS will not recognize any other person as permit owner other than the person listed as permit owner in NMFS permit database.


(ii) *Qualifying criteria for MS/CV endorsement.* In order to qualify for an MS/CV endorsement, a qualifying trawl-endorsed limited entry permit must have been registered to a vessel or vessels that caught and delivered a cumulative amount of at least 500 mt of Pacific whiting to motherships between 1994 through 2003. The calculation will be based on the following:


(A) To determine a permit's qualifying catch history, NMFS will use documented deliveries to a mothership in Pacific whiting observer data as recorded in the relevant NORPAC dataset on August 1, 2010.


(B) The qualifying catch history will include any deliveries of Pacific whiting to motherships by vessels registered to limited entry trawl-endorsed permits that were subsequently combined to generate the current permit.


(C) If two or more limited entry trawl permits have been simultaneously registered to the same vessel, NMFS will divide the qualifying catch history evenly between all such limited entry trawl-endorsed permits during the time they were simultaneously registered to the vessel.


(D) History of illegal deliveries will not be included in the qualifying catch history.


(E) Deliveries made from Federal limited entry groundfish permits that were retired through the Federal buyback program will not be included in the qualifying catch history.


(F) Deliveries made under provisional “A” permits that did not become “A” permits and “B” permits will not be included in the qualifying catch history.


(iii) *Qualifying criteria for catch history assignment.* A catch history assignment will be specified as a percent on the MS/CV-endorsed permit. The calculation will be based on the following:


(A) For determination of a permit's catch history, NMFS will use documented deliveries to a mothership in Pacific whiting observer data as recorded in the relevant NORPAC dataset on August 1, 2010.


(B) NMFS will use relative history, which means the catch history of a permit for a year divided by the total fleet history for that year, expressed as a percent. NMFS will calculate relative history for each year in the qualifying period from 1994 through 2003 by dividing the total deliveries of Pacific whiting to motherships for the vessel(s) registered to the permit for each year by the sum of the total catch of Pacific whiting delivered to mothership vessel(s) for that year.


(C) NMFS will select the eight years with the highest relative history of Pacific whiting, unless the applicant requests a different set of eight years during the initial issuance and appeals process, and will add the relative histories for these years to generate the permit's total relative history. NMFS will then divide the permit's total relative history by the sum of all qualifying permits' total relative histories to determine the permit's catch history assignment, expressed as a percent.


(D) The total relative history will include any deliveries of Pacific whiting to motherships by vessels registered to limited entry trawl-endorsed permits that were subsequently combined to generate the current permit.


(E) If two or more limited entry trawl permits have been simultaneously registered to the same vessel, NMFS will split the catch history evenly between all such limited entry trawl-endorsed permits during the time they were simultaneously registered to the vessel.


(F) History of illegal deliveries will not be included in the calculation of a permit's catch history assignment or in the calculation of relative history for individual years.


(G) Deliveries made from Federal limited entry groundfish permits that were retired through the Federal buyback program will not be included in the calculation of a permit's catch history assignment other than for the purpose of calculating relative history for individual years.


(H) Deliveries made under provisional “A” permits that did not become “A” permits and “B” permits will not be included in the calculation of a permit's catch history assignment other than for the purpose of calculating relative history for individual years.


(iv) *MS/CV endorsement and catch history assignment application.* Persons may apply for an initial issuance of an MS/CV endorsement on a limited entry trawl permit and its associated catch history assignment in one of two ways: complete and submit a prequalified application received from NMFS, or complete and submit an application package. The completed application must be either postmarked or hand-delivered within normal business hours no later than November 1, 2010. If an applicant fails to submit a completed application by the deadline date, they forgo the opportunity to receive consideration for an initial issuance of an MS/CV endorsement and associated catch history assignment.


(A) *Prequalified application.* A “prequalified application” is a partially pre-filled application where NMFS has preliminarily determined the catch history that may qualify the applicant for an initial issuance of an MS/CV endorsement and associated catch history assignment. NMFS will mail prequalified application packages to the owners of current limited entry trawl permits, as listed in the NMFS permit database at the time applications are mailed, which NMFS determines may qualify for an MS/CV endorsement and associated catch history assignment. NMFS will mail the application by certified mail to the current address of record in the NMFS permit database. The application will contain the basis of NMFS' calculation. The application package will include, but is not limited to: a prequalified application (with landings history), a Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest form, and any other documents NMFS believes are necessary to aid the limited entry permit owner in completing the application.


(B) *Request for an application.* Any owner of a current limited entry trawl permit that does not receive a prequalified application that believes the permit qualifies for an initial issuance of an MS/CV endorsement and associated catch history assignment must complete an application package and submit the completed application to NMFS by the application deadline. Application packages are available on the NMFS Web site (*https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/region/west-coast*) or by contacting SFD. An application must include valid NORPAC data, copies of NMFS observer data forms, or other credible information that substantiates the applicant's qualification for an initial issuance of an MS/CV endorsement and associated catch history assignment.


(v) *Corrections to the application.* If the applicant does not accept NMFS' calculation in the prequalified application either in part or whole, in order for NMFS to reconsider NMFS' calculation, the applicant must identify in writing to NMFS which parts of the application that the applicant contends to be inaccurate, and must provide specific credible information to substantiate any requested corrections. The completed application and specific credible information must be provided to NMFS in writing by the application deadline. Written communication must be either post-marked or hand-delivered within normal business hours no later than November 1, 2010. Requests for corrections may only be granted for changes to the selection of the eight years with the highest relative history of whiting and errors in NMFS' use or application of data, including:


(A) Errors in NMFS' use or application of data from NORPAC;


(B) Errors in NMFS' calculations;


(C) Errors in the identification of the permit owner, permit combinations, or vessel registration as listed in the NMFS permit database; and


(D) Errors in NMFS' use or application of ownership interest information.


(vi) *Submission of the application and application deadline*—(A) *Submission of the application.* Submission of the complete, certified application includes, but is not limited to, the following:


(*1*) The applicant is required to sign and date the application and have the document notarized by a licensed Notary Public.


(*2*) The applicant must certify that they qualify to own an MS/CV-endorsed permit and associated catch history assignment.


(*3*) The applicant must indicate they accept NMFS' calculation of initial issuance of an MS/CV-endorsed permit and associated catch history assignment provided in the prequalified application, or provide credible information that demonstrates their qualification for an MS/CV-endorsed permit and associated catch history assignment.


(*4*) The applicant is required to provide a complete Trawl Identification of Ownership Interest Form as specified at paragraph (g)(3)(i)(C) of this section.


(*5*) Business entities may be required to submit a corporate resolution or other credible documentation as proof that the representative of the entity is authorized to act on behalf of the entity; and


(*6*) NMFS may request additional information of the applicant as necessary to make an IAD on initial issuance of an MS/CV-endorsed permit and associated catch history assignment.


(B) *Application deadline.* A complete, certified application must be either postmarked or hand-delivered within normal business hours to NMFS West Coast Region, Permits Office, Bldg. 1, 7600 Sand Point Way NE., Seattle, WA 98115, no later than November 1, 2010. NMFS will not accept or review any applications received or postmarked after the application deadline. There are no hardship provisions for this deadline.


(vii) *Permit transfer during application period.* NMFS will not review or approve any request for a change in limited entry trawl permit owner at any time after either November 1, 2010 or the date upon which the application is received by NMFS, whichever occurs first, until a final decision is made by the Regional Administrator on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce on that permit.


(viii) *Initial Administrative Determination (IAD).* NMFS will issue an IAD for all complete, certified applications received by the application deadline date. If NMFS approves an application for initial issuance of an MS/CV-endorsed permit and associated catch history assignment, the applicant will receive an MS/CV endorsement on a limited entry trawl permit specifying the amounts of catch history assignment for which the applicant has qualified. If NMFS disapproves an application, the IAD will provide the reasons. If known at the time of the IAD, NMFS will indicate if the owner of the MS/CV-endorsed permit has ownership interest in catch history assignments that exceed the accumulation limits and are subject to divestiture provisions given at paragraph (g)(3)(i)(D) of this section. If the applicant does not appeal the IAD within 60 calendar days of the date on the IAD, the IAD becomes the final decision of the Regional Administrator acting on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce.


(ix) *Appeals.* For an MS/CV-endorsed permit and associated catch history assignment issued under this section, the appeals process and timelines are specified at § 660.25(g), subpart C. For the initial issuance of an MS/CV-endorsed permit and associated catch history assignment, the bases for appeal are described in paragraph (g)(6)(v) of this section. Items not subject to appeal include, but are not limited to, the accuracy of data in the relevant NORPAC dataset on August 1, 2010.


(7) *Cost recovery.* The fish seller, as defined at § 660.111, is subject to the cost recovery program specified at § 660.115.


(h) *non-cooperative fishery*—(1) *Access to non-cooperative fishery allocation.* All vessels registered to the MS/CV-endorsed permits assigned to the non-cooperative fishery will have access to harvest and deliver the aggregate catch history assignment of all MS/CV permits assigned to the non-cooperative fishery.


(2) *non-cooperative fishery closure.* The non-cooperative fishery will be closed by automatic action as specified at § 660.60(d) when the Pacific whiting or non-whiting allocations to the non-cooperative fishery have been reached or are projected to be reached.


(i) *Retention requirements.* Catcher vessels participating in the MS Co-op Program may discard minor operational amounts of catch at sea if the observer or EMS has accounted for the discard (*i.e.,* a maximized retention fishery).


(j) *Observer requirements*—(1) *Observer coverage requirements*—(i) *Coverage.* The following observer coverage pertains to certified observers obtained from an observer provider permitted by NMFS.


(A) *MS vessels.* Any vessel registered to an MS permit 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA or longer must carry two certified observers, and any vessel registered to an MS permit shorter than 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA must carry one certified observer, each day that the vessel is used to take, retain, receive, land, process, or transport groundfish.


(B) *Catcher vessels.* Any vessel delivering catch to any MS vessel must carry one certified observer each day that the vessel is used to take groundfish, unless the catcher vessel has a valid EM Authorization and is fishing with EM under § 660.604 of subpart J.


(C) *Gear testing exemption.* Vessels are exempt from the requirement to maintain observer coverage as specified in this paragraph (j) while gear testing as defined at § 660.11. The vessel operator must submit a valid declaration for gear/equipment testing, as required by § 660.13(d)(4)(iv)(A), and must notify the Observer Program of the gear testing activity at least 48 hours prior to departing on a trip to test gear/equipment.


(ii) *Observer workload*—(A) *MS vessels.* The time required for the observer to complete sampling duties must not exceed 12 consecutive hours in each 24-hour period.


(B) *Catcher vessels.* If an observer is unable to perform their duties for any reason, the vessel is required to be in port within 36 hours of the last haul sampled by the observer.


(iii) *Refusal to board.* Any boarding refusal on the part of the observer or vessel must be reported to the Observer Program and OLE by the observer provider. The observer must be available for an interview with the Observer Program or OLE if necessary.


(2) *Vessel responsibilities.* An operator and/or crew of a vessel required to carry an observer must provide:


(i) *Accommodations and food*—(A) *MS vessels.* Provide accommodations and food that are equivalent to those provided for officers, engineers, foremen, deck-bosses or other management level personnel of the vessel.
