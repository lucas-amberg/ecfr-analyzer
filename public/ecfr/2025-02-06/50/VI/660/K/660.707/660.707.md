# § 660.707   Permits.

(a) *General.* This section applies to vessels that fish for HMS off or land HMS in the States of California, Oregon, and Washington.


(1) A commercial fishing vessel of the United States must be registered for use under a general HMS permit that authorizes the use of specific gear, and a recreational charter vessel must be registered for use under a HMS permit if that vessel is used:


(i) To fish for HMS in the U.S. EEZ off the States of California, Oregon, and Washington; or


(ii) To land or transship HMS shoreward of the outer boundary of the U.S. EEZ off the States of California, Oregon, and Washington.


(2) The permit must be on board the vessel and available for inspection by an authorized officer, except that if the permit was issued while the vessel was at sea, this requirement applies only to any subsequent trip.


(3) A permit is valid only for the vessel for which it is registered. A permit not registered for use with a particular vessel may not be used.


(4) Only a person eligible to own a documented vessel under the terms of 46 U.S.C. 12102(a) may be issued or may hold (by ownership or otherwise) a general HMS permit.


(b) *Application.* (1) Following publication of the final rule implementing the FMP, NMFS will issue general HMS permits to the owners of those vessels on a list of vessels obtained from owners previously applying for a permit under the authority of the High Seas Fishing Compliance Act, the Tuna Conventions Act of 1950, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and the Fishery Management Plan for Pelagic Fisheries of the Western Pacific Region, or whose vessels are listed on the vessel register of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission.


(2) All permits issued by NMFS in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section will authorize the use of specific fishing gear by the identified commercial fishing vessels.


(3) An owner of a vessel subject to these requirements who has not received a permit under this section from NMFS and who wants to engage in the fisheries must apply to the SFD for the required permit in accordance with the following:




(i) A West Coast Region Federal Fisheries application form may be obtained from the West Coast Region Fisheries Permits Office or downloaded from the West Coast Region website to apply for a permit under this section. A completed application is one that contains all the necessary information, and required fees, documentation, and signatures.


(ii) A minimum of 15 days should be allowed for processing a permit application. If an incomplete or improperly completed application is filed, the applicant will be sent a notice of deficiency. If the applicant fails to correct the deficiency within 30 days following the date of notification, the application will be considered abandoned.


(iii) A permit will be issued by the SFD. If an application is denied, the SFD will indicate the reasons for denial.


(iv)(A) Any applicant for an initial permit may appeal the initial issuance decision to the Regional Administrator. To be considered by the Regional Administrator, such appeal must be in writing and state the reasons for the appeal, and must be submitted within 30 days of the action by the Regional Administrator. The appellant may request an informal hearing on the appeal.


(B) Upon receipt of an appeal authorized by this section, the Regional Administrator will notify the permit applicant, or permit holder as appropriate, and will request such additional information and in such form as will allow action upon the appeal.


(C) Upon receipt of sufficient information, the Regional Administrator will decide the appeal in accordance with the permit provisions set forth in this section at the time of the application, based upon information relative to the application on file at NMFS and the Council and any additional information submitted to or obtained by the Regional Administrator, the summary record kept of any hearing and the hearing officer's recommended decision, if any, and such other considerations as the Regional Administrator deems appropriate. The Regional Administrator will notify all interested persons of the decision, and the reasons for the decision, in writing, normally within 30 days of the receipt of sufficient information, unless additional time is needed for a hearing.


(D) If a hearing is requested, or if the Regional Administrator determines that one is appropriate, the Regional Administrator may grant an informal hearing before a hearing officer designated for that purpose after first giving notice of the time, place, and subject matter of the hearing to the applicant. The appellant, and, at the discretion of the hearing officer, other interested persons, may appear personally or be represented by counsel at the hearing and submit information and present arguments as determined appropriate by the hearing officer. Within 30 days of the last day of the hearing, the hearing officer shall recommend in writing a decision to the Regional Administrator.


(E) The Regional Administrator may adopt the hearing officer's recommended decision, in whole or in part, or may reject or modify it. In any event, the Regional Administrator will notify interested persons of the decision, and the reason(s) therefore, in writing, within 30 days of receipt of the hearing officer's recommended decision. The Regional Administrator's decision will constitute the final administrative action by NMFS on the matter.


(F) Any time limit prescribed in this section may be extended for a period not to exceed 30 days by the Regional Administrator for good cause, either upon his or her own motion or upon written request from the appellant stating the reason(s) therefore.


(4) General HMS permits issued under this subpart will remain valid until the first date of renewal, and permits may be subsequently renewed for 2-year terms. The first date of renewal will be the last day of the vessel owner's birth month in the second calendar year after the permit is issued (e.g., if the birth month is March and the permit is issued on October 3, 2007, the permit will remain valid through March 31, 2009).


(5) Replacement permits may be issued without charge to replace lost or mutilated permits. Replacement permits may be obtained by submitting to the SFD c/o the Regional Administrator a complete, signed vessel permit application. An application for a replacement permit is not considered a new application.


(6) Any permit that has been altered, erased, or mutilated is invalid.


(c) *Display.* Any permit issued under this subpart, or a facsimile of the permit, must be on board the vessel at all times while the vessel is fishing for, taking, retaining, possessing, or landing HMS shoreward of the outer boundary of the fishery management area unless the vessel was at sea at the time the permit was issued. Any permit issued under this section must be displayed for inspection upon request of an authorized officer.


(d) *Sanctions.* Procedures governing sanctions and denials are found at subpart D of 15 CFR part 904.


(e) *Fees.* An application for a permit, or renewal of an existing permit under this section will include a fee for each vessel. The fee amount required will be calculated in accordance with the NOAA Finance Handbook and specified on the application form.


(f) *Federal limited entry drift gillnet permit*—(1) *General.* This section applies to individuals fishing with large-mesh (14 inch or greater stretched mesh) drift gillnet (DGN) gear. Individuals who target, retain, transship, or land fish captured with a large-mesh DGN must possess a valid Federal limited entry DGN permit. Federal limited entry DGN permits are issued to an individual, and a vessel must be specified on the permit.


(2) *Initial qualification.* Upon publication of NMFS' final rule to establish the Federal limited entry DGN permit, all State of California limited entry DGN permit holders are eligible to obtain a Federal limited entry DGN permit. If a 2017-2018 California state DGN permit renewal application is not received by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife or postmarked by March 31, 2018, the permit holder is not eligible to receive a 2018-2019 Federal limited entry DGN permit.


(3) *Documentation and burden of proof.* An individual applying for issuance, renewal, transfer, or assignment of a Federal limited entry DGN permit must prove that they meet the qualification requirements by submitting the following documentation, as applicable: A certified copy of the assigned vessel's documentation as a fishing vessel of the United States (U.S. Coast Guard or state) is the best evidence of vessel identification; a copy of a current State of California limited entry DGN permit is the best evidence of initial qualification for a Federal limited entry DGN permit; a copy of a written contract reserving or conveying limited entry rights is the best evidence of reserved or acquired rights; and other relevant, credible evidence that the applicant may wish to submit or that the SFD may request or require.


(4) *Fees.* Any processing fee will be determined by the service costs needed to process a permit request. If a fee is required, it would cover administrative expenses related to issuing limited entry permits, as well as renewing, transferring, assigning, and replacing permits. The amount of any fee will be calculated in accordance with the procedures of the NOAA Finance Handbook for determining the administrative costs of each special product or service. A fee may not exceed such costs and is specified with each application form. The appropriate fee must accompany each application.


(5) *Initial decisions.* (i) The SFD will make initial decisions regarding issuing, renewing, transferring, and assigning limited entry permits.


(ii) Adverse decisions shall be in writing and shall state the reasons for the adverse decision.


(iii) The SFD may decline to act on an application for issuing, renewing, transferring, or assigning a limited entry permit and will notify the applicant, if the permit sanction provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act at 16 U.S.C. 1858(a) and implementing regulations at 15 CFR part 904, subpart D, apply.


(6) *Issuance.* Federal limited entry DGN permits will be issued by the SFD. If an application is denied, the SFD will indicate the reasons for denial. A DGN permit will be issued to an individual and assigned to a specific vessel. A permit holder may assign the permit to another vessel once per permit year (April 1 to March 31).


(7) *Appeals.* Any applicant for an initial permit may appeal the initial issuance decision to the Regional Administrator. Appeals will be made and processed following procedures as described at paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section.


(8) *Transfers.* Federal limited entry DGN permits may be transferred to another individual only if the current permit holder has held the Federal DGN permit for a minimum of three consecutive years (counted April 1 to March 31 of the following year). At the time of the establishment of the Federal limited entry DGN permit system, the length of time an individual has held a State of California limited entry DGN permit carries over (e.g., if an individual has held a California DGN permit for two years, they are eligible to transfer the Federal DGN permit after holding the Federal DGN permit for one year). Exceptions to this limitation on permit transfer may be made under the following circumstances:


(i) The permit holder suffers from a serious illness or permanent disability that prevents the permit holder from earning a livelihood from commercial fishing.


(ii) If a deceased permit holder's estate or heirs submit a transfer request within six months of the permit holder's death.


(iii) Upon dissolution of marriage if the permit is held as community property.


(9) *Renewals.* (i) The SFD will send notices to renew limited entry permits to the most recent address of the permit holder on file.


(ii) The permit owner is responsible for renewing a limited entry permit.


(iii) The deadline for receipt or postmark of a Federal DGN permit renewal application is April 30 of the permit year (*i.e.,* April 30, 2019 for 2019-2020 fishing season). Federal DGN permits must be renewed yearly.


(iv) A DGN permit that is allowed to expire will not be renewed unless the permit owner requests reissuance by July 31 (three months after the renewal application deadline) and NMFS determines that failure to renew was proximately caused by illness, injury, or death of the permit owner. If the permit expires, it will be forfeited and NMFS will not reissue the permit to anyone.


(10) *Owner on-board requirement.* (i) Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(10)(ii) through (v) of this section, the DGN permit holder must be on-board the vessel and in possession of a valid Federal limited entry DGN permit when engaged in DGN fishing activity.


(ii) A permit holder may designate another individual to fish under their permit for up to 15 days per fishing year (April 1 to March 31 of the following year); the substitute must comply with all other Federal permitting requirements. A permit holder shall notify NMFS of a substitution at least 24 hours prior to the commencement of the trip.


(iii) If the person who owns a Federal DGN permit is prevented from being on-board a fishing vessel because the person died, is ill, or is injured, NMFS may allow an exemption to the owner on-board requirement for more than 15 days. The person requesting the exemption must send a letter to NMFS requesting an exemption from the owner on-board requirements, with appropriate evidence as described at paragraph (f)(10)(iv) or (v) of this section. All exemptions for death, injury, or illness will be evaluated by NMFS and a decision will be made in writing to the permit owner (or, in the case of the death of the permit owner, to the estate or heirs of the permit owner) within 60 calendar days of receipt of the original exemption request.


(iv) Evidence of death of the permit owner shall be provided to NMFS in the form of a copy of a death certificate. In the interim before the estate is settled, if the deceased permit owner was subject to the owner on-board requirements, the estate of the deceased permit owner may send a letter to NMFS with a copy of the death certificate, requesting an exemption from the owner-on-board requirements. An exemption due to death of the permit owner will be effective only until such time that the estate of the deceased permit owner has registered the deceased permit owner's permit to a beneficiary, transferred the permit to another owner, or three years after the date of death as proven by a death certificate, whichever is earliest. An exemption from the owner-on-board requirement will be conveyed in a letter from NMFS to the estate of the permit owner and is required to be on the vessel during DGN fishing operations.


(v) Evidence of illness or injury that prevents the permit owner from participating in the fishery shall be provided to NMFS in the form of a letter from a certified medical practitioner. This letter must detail the relevant medical conditions of the permit owner and how those conditions prevent the permit owner from being on-board a fishing vessel during DGN fishing. An exemption due to injury or illness will be effective only for the fishing year of the request for exemption. In order to extend a medical exemption for a succeeding year, the permit owner must submit a new request and provide documentation from a certified medical practitioner detailing why the permit owner is still unable to be on-board a fishing vessel. An exemption from the owner-on-board requirement will be conveyed in a letter from NMFS to the permit owner and is required to be on the vessel during DGN fishing operations.


(g) *Limited entry deep-set buoy gear (DSBG) permit*—(1) *General.* This paragraph (g) applies to persons (as defined at § 660.702) owning a limited entry permit to fish with DSBG (as defined at § 660.702) inside the Southern California Bight (as defined at § 660.715(d)(2)) and to vessels registered to such permits. For a vessel to be used to fish with DSBG in the Southern California Bight, that vessel must be registered for use with a limited entry DSBG permit.


(2) *Basic requirements.* Limited entry DSBG permits are issued to a person, and a vessel must be specified on the permit.


(i) *Persons.* Any “person” as defined at § 660.702 may own a limited entry DSBG permit, subject to the ownership requirements and limitations at paragraph (g)(3) of this section.


(ii) *Vessels.* A vessel registered to a limited entry DSBG permit must also be registered to a valid general HMS permit with a DSBG endorsement issued pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. The designated vessel need not be owned by the limited entry DSBG permit owner. The same vessel may be registered to multiple limited entry DSBG permits, but only one permit may be fished at a time.


(3) *Ownership requirements and limitations*—(i) *Limitation on permit ownership.* No person may own more than one limited entry DSBG permit, in whole or in part, including through ownership interest in a partnership, corporation, or other entity.


(ii) *DSBG identification of ownership interest form.* Any person that owns a limited entry DSBG permit and that is applying for or renewing a limited entry DSBG permit shall document those persons that have an ownership interest in the limited entry DSBG permit. This ownership interest must be documented with NMFS via the DSBG Identification of Ownership Interest Form.


(iii) *Transferability.* Limited entry DSBG permits are not transferable, except for a one-time transfer to a family member, as defined at § 660.702, upon the death or legal incapacitation of the individual or a member of the corporation, partnership, or other entity that owns the permit, following the procedures at paragraph (g)(7) of this section. The limited entry DSBG permit owner cannot change or add additional individuals or entities as owners of the permit, or otherwise change ownership of the permit as defined at § 660.702. A transfer may not occur if such a transfer will result in a person holding more than one limited entry DSBG permit as described in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section.


(iv) *Divestiture, surrender, and revocation.* If NMFS discovers that a person owns or has an ownership interest in more than one limited entry DSBG permit (including any person who has ownership interest in the entities listed as owners on the permit), NMFS will notify the permit owner that they have 90 days to divest of the excess ownership interest. During this 90-day period, the person may surrender permit(s) in excess of the permit ownership limit to NMFS by submitting a request in writing. After the 90-day divestiture period, NMFS will revoke all limited entry DSBG permits held by that person in excess of the permit ownership limit. Surrendered and revoked permits, with vessel status as “unidentified,” will be issued to the next eligible applicant following the procedures at paragraphs (g)(11) and (12) of this section.


(4) *Renewal.* Limited entry DSBG permits are valid for 1 year (May 1-April 30). Permits expire April 30 of each year and must be renewed between February 1 and March 31 of each year to remain in force the following permit year.


(i) *Renewal notices.* NMFS will send notices to renew limited entry DSBG permits to the permit owner's most recent email address on record with NMFS. The permit owner is responsible for notifying the Fisheries Permits Office of any email address change.


(ii) *Renewal packages.* A complete limited entry DSBG permit renewal package must be received by NMFS by March 31 of each year. If a complete renewal package is not received by March 31, NMFS will not renew the limited entry DSBG permit, except under the circumstances described in paragraph (g)(4)(iii) of this section. A complete renewal package consists of a completed renewal application form, a completed DSBG Identification of Ownership Interest Form as required under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section, and payment of required fees. NMFS may require additional documentation as it deems necessary to make a determination on the application. The renewal package will be considered incomplete until the required information is submitted. NMFS will decline to act on an incomplete application.


(iii) *Forfeited permits.* A limited entry DSBG permit for which renewal is not requested will be considered expired unless the permit owner requests reissuance of the permit by June 30 (3 months after the renewal application deadline) and NMFS determines that failure to renew was proximately caused by illness, injury, or death of the permit owner. If a permit is allowed to expire, it will be forfeited and NMFS may reissue the permit to another qualified applicant following the procedures at paragraphs (g)(11) and (12) of this section.


(iv) *Renewal determinations.* Based on a complete application for renewal of a limited entry DSBG permit, if NMFS determines that the applicant has met the requirements of this section and is in compliance with any other applicable regulations, NMFS will approve the renewal and issue the permit. If the application is not approved, NMFS will issue an initial administrative decision (IAD) that will explain the denial in writing. The applicant may appeal NMFS' determination following the process at paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section.


(5) *Permit replacement.* Replacement permits may be issued without charge to replace lost or mutilated permits. Replacement permits may be obtained by submitting a complete permit replacement application to NMFS. An application for a replacement permit is not considered a new application. Any permit that has been altered, erased, or mutilated is invalid.


(6) *Change in vessel registration.* Limited entry DSBG permits will normally be registered for use with a particular vessel at the time the permit is issued, renewed, or replaced. A permit may not be used with any vessel other than the vessel registered for use with that permit. If the permit will be used with a vessel other than the one registered for use with the permit, the permit owner must request a change in vessel registration in accordance with paragraphs (g)(6)(ii) through (iv) of this section.


(i) *Limits on changes in vessel registration.* The registered vessel may be changed no more than once per calendar year, except in cases of a *force majeure* event as defined at § 660.702. A permit owner may also designate the vessel registration for a permit as “unidentified,” meaning that no vessel has been identified as registered for use with that permit. Changing a permit's designated vessel to “unidentified” is not considered a change in vessel registration for purposes of this section, but the permit is not authorized for use until a subsequent change of registration out of “unidentified” status occurs. Any subsequent change in registration out of “unidentified” status to a vessel will be considered a change in vessel registration and subject to a once-per-calendar-year limit.


(ii) *Request for change in vessel registration.* To request a change in vessel registration, a permit owner must fill out a vessel transfer application online through the NOAA Fisheries Permits website with appropriate fields completed and must submit the application to the West Coast Region Fisheries Permits Office. A complete change in vessel registration package consists of a transfer application form with appropriate fields completed, a current copy of the United States Coast Guard Documentation Form or state registration form, and payment of required fees. NMFS may require additional documentation as it deems necessary to make a determination on the application. The change in vessel registration package will be considered incomplete until the required information is submitted. NMFS will decline to act on an incomplete application. A permit owner may designate the vessel registration for a permit as “unidentified,” meaning that no vessel has been identified as registered for use with that permit. No vessel is authorized to use a permit with the vessel registration designated as “unidentified.”


(iii) *Agency determination on an application.* Based on a complete application for a change in vessel registration, if NMFS determines that the applicant has met the requirements of this section, NMFS will approve the change in vessel registration and issue the permit. Changes in vessel registration will take effect on the date that the change is approved by NMFS. If the application for a change in vessel registration is not approved, NMFS will issue an initial administrative determination that will explain the denial in writing. The applicant may appeal NMFS' determination following the process at paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section.


(7) *Permit ownership transfer*—(i) *Request for change in permit ownership.* A permit owner may request change in ownership of a permit, in compliance with the limits at paragraph (g)(3) of this section, by submitting a complete transfer application package with appropriate fields completed to NMFS. A complete transfer application package consists of all of the following:


(A) A transfer application form with appropriate fields completed;


(B) For a request to change a permit's ownership where the current permit owner is a corporation, partnership or other business entity, a corporate resolution that authorizes the conveyance of the permit to a new owner and authorizes the individual applicant to request the conveyance on behalf of the corporation, partnership, or other business entity;


(C) For a request to change a permit's ownership that is necessitated by the death of the permit owner(s), a death certificate of the permit owner(s) and appropriate legal documentation that either: Specifically registers the permit to a designated individual(s); or provides legal authority to the transferor to convey the permit ownership; and


(D) Payment of required fees.


(ii) *Incomplete application.* NMFS may require additional documentation as it deems necessary to make a determination on the application for change in ownership. The renewal package will be considered incomplete until the required information is submitted. NMFS will decline to act on an incomplete application.


(iii) *Agency determination on an application.* Based on a complete application for change in ownership, if NMFS determines that the applicant has met the requirements of this section, NMFS will approve the change in ownership and issue the permit. Changes in permit ownership will take effect on the date that the change is approved by NMFS. If the application is not approved, NMFS will issue an initial administrative decision (IAD) that will explain the denial in writing. The applicant may appeal NMFS' determination following the process at paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section.


(8) *Fees.* The Regional Administrator may charge fees to cover administrative expenses related to processing initial issuance, renewal, change in ownership, change in vessel registration, divestiture, and appeals of permits. The amount of the fee is determined in accordance with the procedures of the NOAA Finance Handbook for determining administrative costs. A fee may not exceed administrative costs and is specified with each application form. The appropriate fee must accompany each application.


(9) *Sanctions.* NMFS may decline to act on an application for initial issuance, renewal, replacement, change in ownership, divestiture, or change in vessel registration, and will notify the applicant if the permit sanction provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act at 16 U.S.C. 1858(a) and implementing regulations at 15 CFR part 904, subpart D, apply.


(10) *Appeals.* In cases where the applicant disagrees with NMFS' decision on a permit application for initial issuance, renewal, replacement, change in ownership, divestiture, or change in vessel registration, the applicant may file an appeal following the procedures described at paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section.


(11) *Initial issuance for Tiers 1 through 8.* This section describes the process for initial issuance of limited entry DSBG permits to applicants that qualify under Tiers 1 through 8 as defined at paragraphs (g)(11)(iii)(C)(*1*) through (*8*) of this section.


(i) *Exempted fishing permit (EFP) holder.* For purposes of paragraph (g)(11) of this section only, *exempted fishing permit (EFP) holder* means any individual with NMFS approval to captain a commercial vessel and use DSBG under the authority of a DSBG EFP or any individual who is identified by NMFS as having managed a DSBG EFP, including vessel owners whose vessel fished under the authority of a DSBG EFP.


(ii) *Initial applications.* Persons may apply for a limited entry DSBG permit by completing and submitting an initial issuance application package to NMFS, beginning on June 7, 2023. The completed application package must be submitted on the National Permit System website, or by another method approved by NMFS, no later than 11:59 p.m. on August 7, 2023. If an applicant fails to submit a completed application by the deadline date, they forgo the opportunity to receive a limited entry DSBG permit under Tiers 1 through 8 and their permit will be issued to the next eligible applicant following the procedures at paragraphs (g)(11) and (12) of this section. A complete initial issuance application package consists of the following: a completed initial issuance application form; a completed DSBG Identification of Ownership Interest Form, as required under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section; a current copy of the United States Coast Guard Documentation Form or state registration form for the vessel that will be registered to the permit; and payment of required fees. NMFS may require additional documentation as it deems necessary to make a determination on the application. The initial issuance application package will be considered incomplete until the required information is submitted. NMFS will decline to act on an incomplete application.


(iii) *Eligibility criteria for Tiers 1 through 8.* To qualify for a permit under Tiers 1 through 8, as defined at paragraphs (g)(11)(iii)(C)(*1*) through (*8*) of this section, an applicant must meet all of the following criteria:


(A) The applicant is eligible to own a limited entry DSBG permit in accordance with paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section;


(B) The applicant is in compliance with the ownership requirements and limitations of paragraph (g)(3) of this section. Applicants found to have qualified for more than one permit will be notified by NMFS in writing and will have 30 days to divest of the excess permit ownership interest and resubmit their application package; and


(C) The applicant meets the criteria of one of the qualification tiers in paragraphs (g)(11)(iii)(C)(*1*) through (*8*) of this section based on data as of August 7, 2023. Permits will be issued by ranking applicants according to the tiered criteria in paragraphs (g)(11)(iii)(C)(*1*) through (*8*) of this section, beginning with Tier 1 and ending with Tier 8. NMFS will qualify applicants that meet the criteria of multiple tiers based on their highest tier, with Tier 1 being the highest, Tier 2 the second highest, and so on.

(*8*) Tier 8 consists of any individual with documented commercial swordfish fishing experience between January 1, 1986, and June 7, 2023, on a first come, first served basis, based on California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) permit records showing possession of a valid commercial fishing license on that date and one of the following:


(*i*) A valid CDFW marine landing receipt identifying the individual as the fisherman of record;


(*ii*) A valid state or Federal logbook where swordfish were taken and identifying the individual as captain or crew on that day; and


(*iii*) A signed affidavit from a vessel owner or captain identifying the individual as vessel captain or crew on the day that swordfish were taken.


(iv) *Agency determination on an application.* Based on a complete application for an initial permit under Tiers 1 through 8, as defined at paragraphs (g)(11)(iii)(C)(*1*) through (*8*) of this section, if NMFS determines that the applicant has met the requirements of this section, NMFS will issue an initial administrative determination (IAD). If the application is approved, the applicant will receive a permit according to the permit issuance procedures in paragraph (g)(11)(v) of this section. If the application is denied, the IAD will provide an explanation of the denial in writing. The applicant may appeal NMFS' determination following the process at paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section.


(v) *Permit issuance.* NMFS will issue permits to approved applicants in priority order according to the qualification tiers in paragraphs (g)(11)(iii)(C)(*1*) through (*8*) of this section, with qualified applicants in Tier 1 receiving permits first, then qualified applicants in Tier 2, and so on. Qualified applicants will be further ranked within a tier based on their total swordfish landings for the time period and gear type specified for that tier for Tiers 1 through 5, according to California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) marine landing receipts as of August 7, 2023, or by the date and time their application is received for Tiers 6 through 8. NMFS will issue up to 50 permits in 2023, and up to 25 permits each year after, up to a total of 300 valid permits. Permits issued to the next eligible applicant as a result of surrender, revocation, or expiration will not count toward the annual permit issuance limits. Permits will be mailed on or about April 1 for the upcoming May 1 permit year to the address of record. Permit holders are responsible for keeping their contact information current with NMFS to receive their permit. If a permit is returned to NMFS as undeliverable, NMFS will make further attempts to contact the permit holder using the contact information on file. If NMFS is not able to contact the permit holder within 30 days, the permit will be revoked and issued to the next eligible applicant following the procedures at paragraphs (g)(11) and (12) of this section.


(12) *Initial issuance for Tier 9.* When the list of permit qualifiers from the initial issuance for Tiers 1 through 8, as defined at paragraphs (g)(11)(iii)(C)(*1*) through (*8*) of this section, is exhausted, NMFS will begin accepting applications for additional limited entry DSBG permits on a first come, first served basis. In January of the year NMFS anticipates accepting Tier 9 applications, NMFS will publish a notice in the _Federal Register_ to notify the public of the application opportunity. NMFS will accept applications for initial issuance of limited entry DSBG permits under Tier 9 on an annual basis until a total of 300 limited entry DSBG permits are issued.


(i) *Initial applications.* Persons may apply for a limited entry DSBG permit under Tier 9 by completing and submitting an initial issuance application package to NMFS via the National Permit System website during the annual application period February 1-March 31. The completed application package must be submitted no later than 11:59 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time on March 31st of the relevant year. A complete initial issuance application package consists of the following: a completed initial issuance application form; a completed DSBG Identification of Ownership Interest Form, as required under paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section; a current copy of the United States Coast Guard Documentation Form or state registration form for the vessel that will be registered to the permit; and payment of required fees. NMFS may require additional documentation as it deems necessary to make a determination on the application. The initial issuance application package will be considered incomplete until the required information is submitted. NMFS will decline to act on an incomplete application.


(ii) *Eligibility criteria for Tier 9.* To qualify for a permit under Tier 9, an applicant must meet all of the following criteria:


(A) The applicant is eligible to own a limited entry DSBG permit in accordance with paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section; and


(B) The applicant is in compliance with the ownership requirements and limitations of paragraph (g)(3) of this section.


(iii) *Agency determination on an application.* Based on a complete application, if NMFS determines that the applicant for an initial permit under Tier 9 has met the requirements of this section, NMFS will issue an initial administrative determination (IAD). If the application is approved, the IAD will say so and the applicant will receive a permit according to the permit issuance procedures in paragraph (g)(11)(iv) of this section. If the application is denied, the IAD will provide an explanation of the denial in writing. The applicant may appeal NMFS' determination following the process at paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section.


(iv) *Permit issuance.* NMFS will issue permits to approved applicants under Tier 9 on a first come, first served basis, according to the date and time that their application was submitted through the National Permit System. NMFS will issue up to 25 permits each year, up to a total of 300 valid permits. If NMFS approves more than 25 applications in a single year, the approved applicants above 25 will receive priority for permit issuance the following year according to the date and time that their complete applications were received. Permits issued to the next eligible applicant as a result of surrender, revocation, or expiration will not count toward the annual permit issuance limits.
