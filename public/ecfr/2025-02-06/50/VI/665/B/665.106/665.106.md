# ยง 665.106   American Samoa annual catch limits (ACL).

(a) *Annual catch limits (ACL).* In accordance with ยง 665.4, the ACLs for American Samoa bottomfish MUS during fishing years 2024, 2025 and 2026 are as follows:


(b) *Post-season accountability measure (AM).* If the average catch of any species in the most recent three years exceeds its specified ACL, the Regional Administrator will make an overage adjustment in a separate rulemaking to reduce the ACL for that species for the subsequent year by the amount of the overage. All ACLs for species for which the three most recent years of catch did not exceed the ACL will remain unchanged.


(c) *Indicator species. E. coruscans* will serve as an indicator species for *E. carbunculus* and *P. flavipinnis* will serve as an indicator species for *P. filamentosus.* There are no separate ACLs and AMs for *E. carbunculus* and *P. filamentosus. E. carbunculus* will be subject to the post-season AM if *E. coruscans* exceeds the ACL. *P. filamentosus* will be subject to the post-season AM if *P. flavipinnis* reaches exceeds the ACL.
