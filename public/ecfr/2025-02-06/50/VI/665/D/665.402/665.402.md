# § 665.402   Management subareas.

The Mariana fishery management area is divided into bottomfish management subareas with the following designations and boundaries:


(a) *Guam Management Subarea* means the EEZ seaward of the Territory of Guam, with the inner boundary defined as a line coterminous with the seaward boundary of the Territory of Guam.


(b) *CNMI Management Subarea* means the EEZ seaward of the CNMI, with the inner boundary defined as a line coterminous with the seaward boundary of the CNMI.


(c) The outer boundary of each fishery management area is a line drawn in such a manner that each point on it is 200 nautical miles from the baseline from which the territorial sea is measured, or is coterminous with adjacent international maritime boundaries. The boundary between the fishery management areas of Guam and the CNMI extends to those points that are equidistant between Guam and the island of Rota in the CNMI. CNMI and Guam management subareas are divided by a line intersecting these two points: 148° E. long., 12° N. lat., and 142° E. long., 16° N. lat.
