# § 679.4   Permits.

(a) *Requirements.* Only persons who are U.S. citizens are authorized to receive or hold permits under this section, with the exception that an IFQ hired master permit or a CDQ hired master permit need not be held by a U.S. citizen.


(1) *What permits are available?* Various types of permits are issued for programs codified at 50 CFR parts 300 and 679. These permits are listed in the following table. The date of effectiveness for each permit is given along with certain reference paragraphs for further information.


(2) *Permit and logbook required by participant and fishery.* For the various types of permits issued, refer to § 679.5 for recordkeeping and reporting requirements. For subsistence and GAF permits, refer to § 300.65 of this title for recordkeeping and reporting requirements.


(3) *Permit application*—(i) *Obtain and submit an application.* A person may obtain an application for a new permit or for renewal or revision of an existing permit for any of the permits under this section and must submit forms to NMFS as instructed in application instructions. With appropriate software, all permit applications may be completed online and printed from the Alaska Region website at *http://alaskafisheries.noaa.gov.*

(ii) *Deficient application.* Upon receipt of an incomplete or improperly completed permit application, the Program Administrator, RAM, will notify the applicant of the deficiency in the permit application. If the applicant fails to correct the deficiency, the permit will not be issued. No permit will be issued to an applicant until a complete application is received. 


(iii) *Separate permit.* The operator, manager, Registered Buyer, or Registered Crab Receiver must obtain a separate permit for each applicant, facility, or vessel, as appropriate to each Federal permit in this section.


(iv) The information requested on the application must be typed or printed legibly.

(7) *Sanctions and denials.* Procedures governing sanctions and denials are found at subpart D of 15 CFR part 904. Such procedures are required for enforcement purposes, not administrative purposes. 


(8) *Harvesting privilege.* Quota shares, permits, or licenses issued pursuant to this part are neither a right to the resource nor any interest that is subject to the “takings” provision of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Rather, such quota shares, permits, or licenses represent only a harvesting privilege that may be revoked or amended subject to the requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Act and other applicable law.


(9) *Permit surrender.* (i) The Regional Administrator will recognize the voluntary surrender of a permit issued in this section, if a permit may be surrendered and if it is submitted by the person named on the permit, owner of record, or authorized representative.

(iii) Objective written evidence is considered proof of a timely application. The responsibility remains with the sender to prove when the application to amend or to surrender a permit was received by NMFS (*i.e.*, by certified mail or other method that provides written evidence that NMFS Alaska Region received it).


(iv) For applications delivered by hand delivery or carrier only, the receiving date of signature by NMFS staff is the date the application was received. If the application is submitted by fax or mail, the receiving date of the application is the date stamped received by NMFS.


(b) *Federal fisheries permit (FFP)*—(1) *Requirements.* (i) No vessel of the United States may be used to retain groundfish in the GOA or BSAI or engage in any fishery in the GOA or BSAI that requires retention of groundfish, unless the owner or authorized representative first obtains an FFP for the vessel, issued under this part. An FFP is issued without charge. Only persons who are U.S. citizens are authorized to receive or hold an FFP.


(ii) Each vessel within the GOA or BSAI that retains groundfish must have a legible copy of a valid FFP on board at all times.

(D) An owner or authorized representative, who applied for and received an FFP, must notify NMFS of the intention to surrender the FFP by submitting an FFP application found at the NMFS Web site at *http://www.alaskafisheries.noaa.gov* and indicating on the application that surrender of the permit is requested. Upon receipt and processing of an FFP surrender application, NMFS will withdraw the FFP from active status in the FFP data bases.


(iii) *Amended permit*—(A) An owner or authorized representative who applied for and received an FFP, must notify NMFS of any change in the permit information by submitting an FFP application found at the NMFS Web site at *http://alaskafisheries.noaa.gov.* The owner or authorized representative must submit the application form as instructed on the form. Except as provided under paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(B) and (C) of this section, upon receipt and approval of an application form for permit amendment, NMFS will issue an amended FFP.


(B) In the BSAI, NMFS will not approve an application to amend an FFP to remove a catcher/processor or catcher vessel operation type endorsement, trawl gear type endorsement, pot gear type endorsement, hook-and-line gear type endorsement, or BSAI area endorsement from an FFP that has been issued with endorsements for catcher/processor or catcher vessel operation type, trawl, pot, or hook-and-line gear type, and the BSAI area.

(ii) The gear specified on a scallop license will be restricted to two dredges with a combined width of no more than 20 feet (6.1 m) in all areas if the eligible applicant was a moratorium permit holder with a Scallop Registration Area H (Cook Inlet) endorsement and did not make a legal landing of scallops caught outside Area H during the qualification period specified in paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section.


(4) *Application for a scallop license*—(i) *General.* The Regional Administrator will issue a scallop license to an applicant if a complete application is submitted by or on behalf of the applicant during the specified application period, and if that applicant meets all the criteria for eligibility in this part. An application that is postmarked or hand delivered after the ending date for the application period for the scallop LLP specified in paragraph § 679.4(g)(4)(ii) will be denied. An application form will be sent to the last known address of the person identified as an eligible applicant by the official LLP record.

(E) For the vessel(s) being used as the basis for eligibility for a license, the name, state registration number (e.g., ADF&G number), the USCG documentation number, and valid evidence of the LOA on February 8, 1999, of the longest vessel used by the applicant during the qualification period specified in paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section.


(iv) *Successor-in-interest.* If an applicant is applying as the successor-in-interest to an eligible applicant, an application, to be complete, also must contain valid evidence proving the applicant's status as a successor-in-interest to that eligible applicant and:


(A) Valid evidence of the death of that eligible applicant at the time of application, if the eligible applicant was an individual; or


(B) Valid evidence that the eligible applicant is no longer in existence at the time of application, if the eligible applicant is not an individual.


(v) *Application evaluation.* The Regional Administrator will evaluate an application submitted during the specified application period and compare all claims in the application with the information in the official LLP record. Claims in the application that are consistent with information in the official LLP record will be accepted by the Regional Administrator. Inconsistent claims in the application, unless verified by evidence, will not be accepted. An applicant who submits inconsistent claims, or an applicant who fails to submit the information specified in paragraphs (g)(4)(iii) and (g)(4)(iv) of this section, will be provided a 60-day evidentiary period pursuant to paragraph (g)(4)(vii) of this section to submit the specified information, submit evidence to verify his or her inconsistent claims, or submit a revised application with claims consistent with information in the official LLP record. An applicant who submits claims that are inconsistent with information in the official LLP record has the burden of proving that the submitted claims are correct.


(vi) *Additional information or evidence.* The Regional Administrator will evaluate additional information or evidence to support an applicant's inconsistent claims submitted within the 60-day evidentiary period pursuant to paragraph (g)(4)(vii) of this section. If the Regional Administrator determines that the additional information or evidence meets the applicant's burden of proving that the inconsistent claims in his or her application are correct, the official LLP record will be amended and the information will be used in determining whether the applicant is eligible for a license. However, if the Regional Administrator determines that the additional information or evidence does not meet the applicant's burden of proving that the inconsistent claims in his or her application is correct, the applicant will be notified by an initial administrative determination, pursuant to paragraph (g)(4)(viii) of this section, that the applicant did not meet the burden of proof to change the information in the official LLP record.


(vii) *60-day evidentiary period.* The Regional Administrator will specify by letter a 60-day evidentiary period during which an applicant may provide additional information or evidence to support the claims made in his or her application, or to submit a revised application with claims consistent with information in the official LLP record, if the Regional Administrator determines that the applicant did not meet the burden of proving that the information on the application is correct through evidence provided with the application. Also, an applicant who fails to submit information as specified in paragraphs (g)(4)(iii) and (g)(4)(iv) of this section will have 60 days to provide that information. An applicant will be limited to one 60-day evidentiary period. Additional information or evidence, or a revised application, received after the 60-day evidentiary period specified in the letter has expired will not be considered for purposes of the initial administrative determination.


(viii) *Initial administrative determinations (IAD).* The Regional Administrator will prepare and send an IAD to the applicant following the expiration of the 60-day evidentiary period if the Regional Administrator determines that the information or evidence provided by the applicant fails to support the applicant's claims and is insufficient to rebut the presumption that the official LLP record is correct, or if the additional information, evidence, or revised application is not provided within the time period specified in the letter that notifies the applicant of his or her 60-day evidentiary period. The IAD will indicate the deficiencies in the application, including any deficiencies with the information, the evidence submitted in support of the information, or the revised application. The IAD will also indicate which claims cannot be approved based on the available information or evidence. An applicant who receives an IAD may appeal pursuant to § 679.43. An applicant who avails himself or herself of the opportunity to appeal an IAD will not receive a transferable license until after the final resolution of that appeal in the applicant's favor. 


(ix) *Issuance of a non-transferable license.* The Regional Administrator will issue a non-transferable license to the applicant at the same time notification is provided to the applicant of his or her 60-day evidentiary period if issuance is required by the license renewal provisions of 5 U.S.C. 558. A non-transferable license authorizes a person to catch and retain scallops as specified on the non-transferable license, and will have the specific endorsements and designations based on the claims in his or her application. A non-transferable license will expire upon final agency action.


(5) *Transfer of a Scallop License*—(i) *General.* The Regional Administrator will approve the transfer of a scallop license if a complete transfer application is submitted to Restricted Access Management, Alaska Region, NMFS, and if the transfer meets all the eligibility criteria as specified in paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section. An application form may be requested from the Regional Administrator.


(ii) *Eligibility criteria for transfers.* A scallop license can be transferred if:


(A) The designated transferee is eligible to document a fishing vessel under Chapter 121, Title 46, U.S.C.;


(B) The parties to the transfer do not have any fines, civil penalties, other payments due and outstanding, or outstanding permit sanctions resulting from Federal fishing violations;


(C) The transfer will not cause the designated transferee to exceed the license limit in § 679.7(i); and


(D) The transfer does not violate any other provision specified in this part.


(iii) *Contents of transfer application.* To be complete, an application for a scallop license transfer must be signed by the license holder and the designated transferee, or the individuals representing them, and contain the following information, as applicable:


(A) Name, business address, telephone number, and FAX number of the license holder and of the designated transferee;

A person will be limited to one 30-day evidentiary period. Additional information or evidence received after the 30-day evidentiary period specified in the letter has expired will not be considered for purposes of the initial administrative determination.


(E) The Regional Administrator will prepare and send an IAD to the applicant following the expiration of the 30-day evidentiary period if the Regional Administrator determines that the information or evidence provided by the person fails to support a person's claims and is insufficient to rebut the presumption that the official record is correct, or if the additional information, evidence, or revised application is not provided within the time period specified in the letter that notifies the applicant of his or her 30-day evidentiary period. The IAD will indicate the deficiencies with the information, or the evidence submitted in support of the information. The IAD will also indicate which claims cannot be approved based on the available information or evidence. A person who receives an IAD may appeal pursuant to § 679.43. A person who avails himself or herself of the opportunity to appeal an IAD will receive a non-transferable license pending the final resolution of that appeal, notwithstanding the eligibility of that applicant for some claims based on consistent information in the official record.

(*2*) Valid evidence that the eligible applicant is no longer in existence at the time of application, if the eligible applicant is not an individual.


(B) *Norton Sound crab species license endorsement.* If an applicant is applying for a crab species license endorsement for Norton Sound and if the applicant is a person, an application, to be complete, must contain valid evidence that the applicant was a State of Alaska permit holder for the Norton Sound king crab summer fishery in 1993 or 1994. If the applicant is a corporation, an application, to be complete, must contain valid evidence that the corporation owned or had a lease for a vessel on June 17, 1995, that participated in the Norton Sound king crab summer fishery in 1993 or 1994.


(C) *Extended general qualification period.* If an applicant is applying for a license based on meeting the general qualification period requirements of paragraph (k)(4)(i)(A)(*2*) or (k)(4)(i)(B)(*2*) of this section, the application, to be complete, must indicate which single endorsement area the applicant has selected for license. A license cannot be endorsed for more than one area, notwithstanding the fact that the applicant may have the documented harvests to qualify for more than one endorsement area.


(D) *Unavoidable circumstances.* If a person is claiming that unavoidable circumstances prevented him or her from meeting certain eligibility requirements for a license under paragraph (k) of this section, he or she must provide the information required in the particular paragraph of this section authorizing such a claim, and include valid evidence of the date the vessel was lost, damaged, or otherwise unable to participate in the fishery, and the date a documented harvest was made after the vessel was unable to participate in the fishery by the unavoidable circumstance.


(v) *Application evaluation.* The Regional Administrator will evaluate an application submitted during the specified application period and compare all claims in the application with the information in the official LLP record. Claims in the application that are consistent with information in the official LLP record will be accepted by the Regional Administrator. Inconsistent claims in the application, unless verified by evidence, will not be accepted. Pursuant to paragraph (k)(6)(vii) of this section, an applicant who submits inconsistent claims, or an applicant who fails to submit the information specified in paragraphs (k)(6)(iii) and (k)(6)(iv) of this section, will be provided a 60-day evidentiary period pursuant to paragraph (k)(6)(vii) of this section to submit the specified information, submit evidence to verify his or her inconsistent claims, or submit a revised application with claims consistent with information in the official LLP record. An applicant who submits claims that are inconsistent with information in the official LLP record has the burden of proving that the submitted claims are correct.


(vi) *Additional information or evidence.* The Regional Administrator will evaluate additional information or evidence to support an applicant's inconsistent claims submitted within the 60-day evidentiary period pursuant to paragraph (k)(6)(vii) of this section. If the Regional Administrator determines that the additional information or evidence meets the applicant's burden of proving that the inconsistent claims in his or her application is correct, the official LLP record will be amended and the information will be used in determining whether the applicant is eligible for a license. However, if the Regional Administrator determines that the additional information or evidence does not meet the applicant's burden of proving that the inconsistent claims in his or her application is correct, the applicant will be notified by an initial administrative determination, pursuant to paragraph (k)(6)(viii) of this section, that the applicant did not meet the burden of proof to change the information in the official LLP record.


(vii) *60-day evidentiary period.* The Regional Administrator will specify by letter a 60-day evidentiary period during which an applicant may provide additional information or evidence to support the claims made in his or her application, or to submit a revised application with claims consistent with information in the official LLP record, if the Regional Administrator determines that the applicant did not meet the burden of proving that the information on the application is correct through evidence provided with the application. Also, an applicant who fails to submit information as specified in paragraphs (k)(6)(iii) and (k)(6)(iv) of this section will have 60 days to provide that information. An applicant will be limited to one 60-day evidentiary period. Additional information or evidence, or a revised application, received after the 60-day evidentiary period specified in the letter has expired will not be considered for purposes of the initial administrative determination.


(viii) *Initial administrative determinations (IAD).* The Regional will prepare and send an IAD to the applicant following the expiration of the 60-day evidentiary period if the Regional Administrator determines that the information or evidence provided by the applicant fails to support the applicant's claims and is insufficient to rebut the presumption that the official LLP record is correct, or if the additional information, evidence, or revised application is not provided within the time period specified in the letter that notifies the applicant of his or her 60-day evidentiary period. The IAD will indicate the deficiencies in the application, including any deficiencies with the information, the evidence submitted in support of the information, or the revised application. The IAD will also indicate which claims cannot be approved based on the available information or evidence. An applicant who receives an IAD may appeal pursuant to § 679.43. An applicant who avails himself or herself of the opportunity to appeal an IAD will not receive a transferable license until after the final resolution of that appeal, notwithstanding the eligibility of that applicant for some claims based on consistent information in the application.


(ix) *Issuance of a non-transferable license.* The Regional Administrator will issue a non-transferable license to the applicant on issuance of an IAD if required by the license renewal provisions of 5 U.S.C. 558. A non-transferable license authorizes a person to deploy a vessel to conduct directed fishing for license limitation groundfish or crab species as specified on the non-transferable license, and will have the specific endorsements and designations based on the claims in his or her application. A non-transferable license will expire upon final agency action. 


(x) *Surrender of groundfish or crab LLP.* A groundfish or crab LLP license may be voluntarily surrendered in accordance with paragraph (a)(9) of this section. A surrendered groundfish or crab LLP license will cease to exist and will not be subsequently reissued.

(xi) *Surrender and extinguishment of a groundfish LLP endorsement.* Endorsements specified on a groundfish LLP license are not severable from a license and cannot be surrendered except that pot gear Pacific cod endorsements specified on groundfish LLP licenses listed in Column C of Table 9 to this part, can be permanently surrendered, removed, and extinguished if:


(A) The holder of the groundfish LLP license listed in Column C of Table 9 to this part requests, in writing, that NMFS permanently remove and extinguish all pot gear Pacific cod endorsements specified on that LLP license and acknowledges in that written request that the surrender and removal are permanent and irreversible and that all pot gear Pacific cod endorsements on that LLP license are extinguished;


(B) The holder of the groundfish LLP license listed in Column C of Table 9 to this part requests, in writing, that NMFS assign a 220-foot (67 m) MLOA on that LLP license;


(C) The holder of the eligible LLP license, or the authorized agent, signs the request;


(D) NMFS receives the written request to permanently remove and extinguish all pot gear Pacific cod endorsements specified on the LLP groundfish license by February 6, 2017; and


(E) The written request is submitted to NMFS using one of the following methods:


(*1*) Mail: Regional Administrator, c/o Restricted Access Management Program, NMFS, P.O. Box 21668, Juneau, AK 99802-1668;


(*2*) Fax: 907-586-7354; or


(*3*) Hand delivery or carrier: NMFS, Room 713, 709 West 9th Street, Juneau, AK 99801.


(7) *Transfer of a groundfish license or a crab species license*—(i) *General.* The Regional Administrator will transfer a groundfish license, Aleutian Island area endorsement as described under paragraph (k)(7)(viii)(A) of this section, or a crab species license if a complete transfer application is submitted to Restricted Access Management, Alaska Region, NMFS, and if the transfer meets the eligibility criteria as specified in paragraph (k)(7)(ii) of this section. A transfer application form may be requested from the Regional Administrator.


(ii) *Eligibility criteria for transfers.* A groundfish license, Aleutian Island area endorsement as described under paragraph (k)(7)(viii)(A) of this section, or crab species license can be transferred if the following conditions are met:


(A) The designated transferee is eligible to document a fishing vessel under Chapter 121, Title 46, U.S.C.;


(B) The parties to the transfer do not have any fines, civil penalties, other payments due and outstanding, or outstanding permit sanctions resulting from Federal fishing violations;


(C) The transfer will not cause the designated transferee to exceed the license caps in § 679.7(i); and


(D) The transfer does not violate any other provision specified in this part.


(iii) *Contents of application.* To be complete, an application for a groundfish license, Aleutian Island area endorsement as described under paragraph (k)(7)(viii)(A) of this section transfer, or a crab species license transfer must be legible, have dated signatures of the applicants, and the applicants must attest that, to the best of the applicant's knowledge, all statements in the application are true. An application to transfer will be provided by NMFS, or is available on the NMFS Alaska Region website at *http://alaskafisheries.noaa.gov.* The acceptable submittal methods will be specified on the application form.


(iv) *Incomplete applications.* The Regional Administrator will return an incomplete transfer application to the applicant and identify any deficiencies if the Regional Administrator determines that the application does not meet all the criteria identified in paragraph (k)(7) of this section.


(v) *Transfer by court order, operation of law, or as part of a security agreement.* The Regional Administrator will transfer a groundfish license, Aleutian Island area endorsement as described under paragraph (k)(7)(viii)(A) of this section, or a crab species license based on a court order, operation of law, or a security agreement if the Regional Administrator determines that the transfer application is complete and the transfer will not violate any of the provisions of this section.


(vi) *Voluntary transfer limitation.* A groundfish license, Aleutian Island area endorsement as described under paragraph (k)(7)(viii)(A) of this section, or a crab species license may be voluntarily transferred only once in any calendar year. A voluntary transfer is a transfer other than one pursuant to a court order, operation of law, or a security agreement. An application for transfer that would cause a person to exceed the transfer limit of this provision will not be approved. A transfer of an Aleutian Island area endorsement as described under paragraph (k)(7)(viii)(A) of this section to another LLP license, or the transfer of a groundfish license with an Aleutian Island area endorsement as described under paragraph (k)(7)(viii)(A) of this section attached to it will be considered to be a transfer of that Aleutian Island area endorsement.


(vii) *Request to change the designated vessel.* (A) A request to change the vessel designated on an LLP groundfish or crab species license must be made on a transfer application. If this request is approved and made separately from a license transfer, it will count towards the annual limit on voluntary transfers specified in paragraph (k)(7)(vi) of this section.


(B) A request to change the vessel designated on an Amendment 80 LLP license or an Amendment 80 LLP/QS license must be made on an Application for Amendment 80 Replacement Vessel in accordance with § 679.4(o)(4)(ii). The MLOA modification specified at paragraph (k)(3)(i)(C) of this section will be effective when a complete application is submitted to NMFS in accordance with paragraph (k)(7) of this section, and the application is approved by the Regional Administrator.


(viii) *Severability of licenses.* (A) Area endorsements or area/species endorsements specified on a license are not severable from the license and must be transferred together, except that Aleutian Island area endorsements on a groundfish license with a trawl gear designation issued under the provisions of paragraph (k)(4)(ix)(A) of this section and that are assigned to a groundfish license with an MLOA of less than 60 feet LOA may be transferred separately from the groundfish license to which that Aleutian Island area endorsement was originally issued to another groundfish license provided that the groundfish license to which that Aleutian Island endorsement is transferred:


(*1*) Was not derived in whole or in part from the qualifying fishing history of an AFA vessel;


(*2*) Has a catcher vessel designation;


(*3*) Has a trawl gear designation;


(*4*) Has an MLOA of less than 60 feet LOA; and


(*5*) A complete transfer application is submitted to the Regional Administrator as described under this paragraph (k)(7), and that application is approved.


(B) A groundfish license and a crab species license issued based on the legal landings of the same vessel and initially issued to the same qualified person are not severable and must be transferred together. 


(ix) *Other transfer restrictions.* The transfer of a LLP license that was issued based on the documented harvests from a vessel that did not have an FFP during the period beginning January 1, 1988, through October 8, 1998, must be accompanied by the vessel from which the documented harvests were made or its replacement vessel, or if the LLP license and vessel were separated by transfer prior to February 7, 1998, then by the vessel that is currently being deployed by the license holder. The Regional Administrator will deny a transfer application that requests the transfer of a LLP license that was issued based on the documented harvests from a vessel that did not have an FFP during the period beginning January 1, 1988, through October 8, 1998, if the appropriate vessel is not being transferred as part of the same transaction. A license holder of an LLP license that was issued based on the documented harvests from a vessel that did not have an FFP during the period beginning January 1, 1988, through October 8, 1998, may replace the vessel from which the documented harvests were made with another vessel that meets the vessel designation and MLOA requirements specified on the LLP license if the original qualifying vessel is lost or destroyed.


(8) *Other provisions.* (i) Any person committing, or a fishing vessel used in the commission of, a violation of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act or any regulations issued pursuant thereto, is subject to the civil and criminal penalty provisions and the civil forfeiture provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, part 621 of this chapter, 15 CFR part 904 (Civil Procedure), and other applicable law. Penalties include, but are not limited to, permanent or temporary sanctions to licenses.


(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of the license limitation program in this part, vessels fishing for species other than license limitation groundfish as defined in § 679.2 that were authorized under Federal regulations to incidentally catch license limitation groundfish without a Federal fisheries permit described at § 679.4(b) will continue to be authorized to catch the maximum retainable bycatch amounts of license limitation groundfish as provided in this part without a groundfish license.


(iii) An eligible applicant, who qualifies for a groundfish license or crab species license but whose vessel on which the eligible applicant's qualification was based was lost or destroyed, will be issued a license. This license:


(A) Will have the vessel designation of the lost or destroyed vessel.


(B) Cannot be used to conduct directed fishing for license limitation groundfish or to conduct directed fishing for crab species on a vessel that has an LOA greater than the MLOA designated on the license.


(iv) A qualified person who owned a vessel on June 17, 1995, that made a documented harvest of license limitation groundfish, or crab species if applicable, between January 1, 1988, and February 9, 1992, but whose vessel was unable to meet all the criteria in paragraph (k)(4) of this section for a groundfish license or paragraph (k)(5) of this section for a crab species license because of an unavoidable circumstance (*i.e.*, the vessel was lost, damaged, or otherwise unable to participate in the license limitation groundfish or crab fisheries) may receive a license if the qualified person is able to demonstrate that:


(A) The owner of the vessel at the time of the unavoidable circumstance held a specific intent to conduct directed fishing for license limitation groundfish or crab species with that vessel during a specific time period in a specific area.


(B) The specific intent to conduct directed fishing for license limitation groundfish or crab species with that vessel was thwarted by a circumstance that was:


(*1*) Unavoidable.


(*2*) Unique to the owner of that vessel, or unique to that vessel.


(*3*) Unforeseen and reasonably unforeseeable to the owner of the vessel.


(C) The circumstance that prevented the owner from conducting directed fishing for license limitation groundfish or crab species actually occurred.


(D) Under the circumstances, the owner of the vessel took all reasonable steps to overcome the circumstance that prevented the owner from conducting directed fishing for license limitation groundfish or crab species.


(E) Any amount of license limitation groundfish or appropriate crab species was harvested on the vessel in the specific area that corresponds to the area endorsement or area/species endorsement for which the qualified person who owned a vessel on June 17, 1995, is applying and that the license limitation groundfish or crab species was harvested after the vessel was prevented from participating by the unavoidable circumstance but before June 17, 1995.


(v) A groundfish license or a crab species license may be used on a vessel that complies with the vessel designation on the license and that does not exceed the MLOA on the license.


(9) *Pacific cod endorsements in the BSAI*—(i) *General.* In addition to other requirements of this part, and unless specifically exempted in paragraph (k)(9)(iv) of this section, a license holder must have a Pacific cod endorsement on his or her groundfish license to conduct directed fishing for Pacific cod with hook-and-line or pot gear in the BSAI. A license holder can only use the specific non-trawl gear(s) indicated on his or her license to conduct directed fishing for Pacific cod in the BSAI. 


(ii) *Eligibility requirements for a Pacific cod endorsement.* This table provides eligibility requirements for Pacific cod endorsements on an LLP groundfish license:


(iii) *Explanations for Pacific cod endorsements.* (A) All eligibility amounts in the table at paragraph (k)(9)(ii) of this section will be determined based on round weight equivalents. 


(B) Discards will not count toward eligibility amounts in the table at paragraph (k)(9)(ii) of this section. 


(C) Pacific cod harvested for personal bait use will not count toward eligibility amounts in the table at paragraph (k)(9)(ii) of this section. 


(D) A legal landing of Pacific cod in the BSAI for commercial bait will count toward eligibility amounts in the table at paragraph (k)(9)(ii) of this section. 


(E) Harvests within the BSAI will count toward eligibility amounts in the table at paragraph (k)(9)(ii) of this section; however, a license holder will only be able to harvest Pacific cod in the specific areas in the BSAI for which he or she has an area endorsement. 


(F) Harvests within the BSAI Would count toward eligibility amounts in the table at paragraph (k)(9)(ii) of this section if:


(*1*) Those harvests were made from the vessel that was used as the basis of eligibility for the license holder's LLP groundfish license, or


(*2*) Those harvests were made from a vessel that was not the vessel used as the basis of eligibility for the license holder's LLP groundfish license, provided that, at the time the endorsement-qualifying Pacific cod harvests were made, the person who owned such Pacific cod endorsement-qualifying fishing history also owned the fishing history of a vessel that satisfied the requirements for the LLP groundfish license.


(*3*) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (k)(9)(iii)(F)(*2*) of this section, the LLP groundfish license qualifying history or the Pacific cod qualifying history of any one vessel may not be used to satisfy the requirements for issuance of more than one LLP groundfish license endorsed for the BSAI Pacific cod hook-and-line or pot gear fisheries.


(G) Except as provided in paragraph 679.4(k)(9)(iii)(D), only harvests of BSAI Pacific cod in the directed fishery will count toward eligibility amounts. 


(iv) *Exemptions to Pacific cod endorsements.* (A) Any vessel exempted from the License Limitation Program at paragraph (k)(2) of this section. 


(B) Any catcher vessel less than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA.

(v) *Combination of landings and hardship provision.* Notwithstanding the eligibility requirements in paragraph (k)(9)(ii) of this section, a license holder may be eligible for a Pacific cod endorsement by meeting the following criteria. 


(A) *Combination of landings.* A license holder may combine the landings of a sunken vessel and the landings of a vessel obtained to replace a sunken vessel to satisfy the eligibility amounts in the table at paragraph (k)(9)(ii) of this section only if he or she meets the requirements in paragraphs (k)(9)(v)(A)(*1*)-(*4*) of this section. No other combination of landings will satisfy the eligibility amounts in the table at paragraph (k)(9)(ii) of this section. 


(*1*) The sunken vessel was used as the basis of eligibility for the license holder's groundfish license; 


(*2*) The sunken vessel sank after January 1, 1995; 


(*3*) The vessel obtained to replace the sunken vessel was obtained by December 31 of the year 2 years after the sunken vessel sank; and 


(*4*) The length of the vessel obtained to replace the sunken vessel does not exceed the MLOA specified on the license holder's groundfish license. 


(B) *Hardship provision.* A license holder may be eligible for a Pacific cod endorsement because of unavoidable circumstances if he or she meets the requirements in paragraphs (k)(9)(v)(B)(*1*)-(*4*) of this section. For purposes of this hardship provision, the term license holder includes the person whose landings were used to meet the eligibility requirements for the license holder's groundfish license, if not the same person. 


(*1*) The license holder at the time of the unavoidable circumstance held a specific intent to conduct directed fishing for BSAI Pacific cod in a manner sufficient to meet the landing requirements in the table at paragraph (k)(9)(ii) of this section but that this intent was thwarted by a circumstance that was: 


(*i*) Unavoidable; 


(*ii*) Unique to the license holder, or unique to the vessel that was used as the basis of eligibility for the license holder's groundfish license; and 


(*iii*) Unforeseen and reasonably unforeseeable to the license holder. 


(*2*) The circumstance that prevented the license holder from conducting directed fishing for BSAI Pacific cod in a manner sufficient to meet the landing requirements in paragraph (k)(9)(ii) actually occurred; 


(*3*) The license holder took all reasonable steps to overcome the circumstance that prevented the license holder from conducting directed fishing for BSAI Pacific cod in a manner sufficient to meet the landing requirements in paragraph (k)(9)(ii) of this section; and 


(*4*) Any amount of Pacific cod was harvested in the BSAI aboard the vessel that was used as the basis of eligibility for the license holder's groundfish license after the vessel was prevented from participating by the unavoidable circumstance but before April 16, 2000.


(10) *Pacific cod endorsements in the Western and Central GOA*—(i) *General.* In addition to other requirements of this part, and unless specifically exempted in paragraph (k)(10)(iv) of this section, a license holder must have a Pacific cod endorsement on his or her groundfish license to conduct directed fishing for Pacific cod in the Western Gulf of Alaska or Central Gulf of Alaska with hook-and-line gear, pot gear, or jig gear on a vessel using more than five jig machines, more than one line per machine, and more than 30 hooks per line. A license holder can only use the specific non-trawl gear(s) indicated on his or her license to conduct directed fishing for Pacific cod in the Western Gulf of Alaska or Central Gulf of Alaska.


(ii) *Eligibility requirements for a Pacific cod endorsement.* This table provides eligibility requirements for Pacific cod endorsements on an LLP groundfish license:


(iii) *Explanations for Pacific cod endorsements.* (A) All eligibility amounts in the table at paragraph (k)(10)(ii) of this section will be determined based on round weight equivalents.


(B) NMFS shall assign a legal landing to a groundfish license in an area based only on information contained in the official record described in paragraph (k)(10)(v) of this section.


(C) Notwithstanding the eligibility amount in the table at paragraph (k)(10)(ii) of this section, NMFS shall assign a non-trawl Pacific cod endorsement with a catcher/processor and a hook-and-line gear designation in the regulatory areas specified to those groundfish licenses listed in Table 49 to part 679;


(D) If a groundfish license meets the criteria described in paragraph (k)(3)(i)(B)(*2*) of this section and NMFS has redesignated the MLOA of that groundfish license based on those criteria, then NMFS may assign a non-trawl Pacific cod endorsement with the specific gear designation(s) and regulatory area(s) applicable to the redesignated MLOA of that groundfish license based on the eligibility criteria established in paragraph (k)(10)(ii) of this section; and


(E) NMFS may issue groundfish licenses with non-trawl Pacific cod endorsements to CQEs as specified in paragraph (k)(10)(vi) of this section.


(iv) *Exemptions to Pacific cod endorsements.* Any vessel exempted from the License Limitation Program at paragraph (k)(2) of this section.


(v) *Non-trawl gear recent participation official record.* (A) The official record will contain all information used by the Regional Administrator to determine the following:


(*1*) The number of legal landings and amount of legal landings assigned to a groundfish license for purposes of the non-trawl gear designation participation requirements described in paragraph (k)(10)(ii) of this section;


(*2*) All other relevant information necessary to administer the requirements described in paragraphs (k)(3)(i)(B) and (k)(10) of this section.


(B) The official record is presumed to be correct. A groundfish license holder has the burden to prove otherwise.


(C) Only legal landings as defined in § 679.2 and documented on State of Alaska fish tickets or NMFS weekly production reports will be used to assign legal landings to a groundfish license.


(D) If more than one groundfish license holder is claiming the same legal landing because their groundfish license designated the vessel at the time that the legal landing was made, then each groundfish license for which the legal landing is being claimed will be credited with the legal landing.


(E) The Regional Administrator will specify by letter a 30-day evidentiary period during which an applicant may provide additional information or evidence to amend or challenge the information in the official record. A person will be limited to one 30-day evidentiary period. Additional information or evidence received after the 30-day evidentiary period specified in the letter has expired will not be considered for purposes of the initial administrative determination (IAD).


(F) The Regional Administrator will prepare and send an IAD to the applicant following the expiration of the 30-day evidentiary period if the Regional Administrator determines that the information or evidence provided by the person fails to support the person's claims and is insufficient to rebut the presumption that the official record is correct, or if the additional information, evidence, or revised application is not provided within the time period specified in the letter that notifies the applicant of his or her 30-day evidentiary period. The IAD will indicate the deficiencies with the information, or with the evidence submitted in support of the information. The IAD will also indicate which claims cannot be approved based on the available information or evidence. A person who receives an IAD may appeal pursuant to § 679.43. A person who avails himself or herself of the opportunity to appeal an IAD will receive a non-transferable license pending the final resolution of that appeal, notwithstanding the eligibility of that applicant for some claims based on consistent information in the official record.


(vi) *Issuance of non-trawl groundfish licenses to CQEs.* (A) Each CQE that has been approved by the Regional Administrator under the requirements of § 679.41(l)(3) to represent a community listed in Table 21 to part 679 that is eligible for Pacific cod endorsed non-trawl groundfish licenses, may apply to receive the maximum number of groundfish licenses listed in Table 21 to part 679 on behalf of the eligible communities listed in Table 21 to part 679 that CQE is designated to represent. In order to receive a groundfish license, a CQE must submit a complete application for a groundfish license to the Regional Administer. A CQE may not apply for, and may not receive more than the maximum number of groundfish licenses designated in the regulatory area specified for a community as listed in Table 21 to part 679.

(*7*) May not be assigned to any vessel other than the vessel specified for that groundfish license in the annual CQE authorization letter;


(*8*) May not be assigned for use by any person(s) other than the person(s) specified for that groundfish license in the annual CQE authorization letter, or any subsequent amendment to that authorization letter that is made by the CQE provided that NMFS receives that amendment prior to that person using that groundfish license aboard a vessel; and


(*9*) May not be assigned to more than one vessel per calendar year.


(D) The CQE must provide a copy of the annual CQE authorization letter, and any subsequent amendment to that authorization letter that is made by the CQE to NMFS and the vessel operator prior to the person(s) designated in the authorization letter using that groundfish license aboard a vessel. The vessel operator must maintain a copy of the annual CQE authorization letter, and any subsequent amendment to that authorization letter that is made by the CQE onboard the vessel when that vessel is directed fishing for Pacific cod under the authority of that groundfish license. The authorization letter, and any subsequent amendment to that authorization letter must be submitted to the Regional Administrator.


(E) The CQE must attest in the annual CQE authorization letter, or any subsequent amendment to that authorization letter, that the person(s) using a groundfish license issued to a CQE:


(*1*) Is a citizen of the United States;


(*2*) Has maintained a domicile in a CQE community in the Central GOA or Western GOA eligible to receive an LLP license endorsed for Pacific cod for the 12 consecutive months immediately preceding the time when the assertion of residence is made; and


(*3*) Is not claiming residency in another community, state, territory, or country, except that residents of the Village of Seldovia shall be considered to be eligible community residents of the City of Seldovia for the purposes of eligibility to serve as an authorized person.


(F) Non-trawl Pacific cod gear endorsements on groundfish licenses approved for issuance to CQEs by the Regional Administrator shall have the following gear designations:


(*1*) NMFS will issue only pot gear Pacific cod endorsements for groundfish licenses with a Western Gulf of Alaska designation to CQEs on behalf of a community listed in Table 21 to part 679.


(*2*) NMFS will issue either a pot gear or a hook-and-line gear Pacific cod endorsement for a groundfish license with a Central Gulf of Alaska designation to CQEs on behalf of a community listed in Table 21 to part 679 based on the application for a groundfish license as described in paragraph (k)(10)(vi)(B) of this section provided that application is received by NMFS not later than six months after April 21, 2011. If an application to receive a groundfish license with a Central Gulf of Alaska designation on behalf of a community listed in Table 21 to part 679 is received later than six months after April 21, 2011, NMFS will issue an equal number of pot gear and hook-and-line gear Pacific cod endorsements for a groundfish license issued to the CQE on behalf of a community listed in Table 21 to part 679. In cases where the total number of groundfish licenses issued on behalf of a community listed in Table 21 to part 679 is not even, NMFS will issue one more groundfish license with a pot gear Pacific cod endorsement than the number of groundfish licenses with a hook-and-line gear Pacific cod endorsement.


(G) An annual report on the use of Pacific cod endorsed non-trawl groundfish licenses shall be submitted by the CQE as required at § 679.5(t).


(vii) *Additional endorsements for groundfish license holders eligible to participate in the Western and/or Central GOA Pacific cod fisheries*—(A) *Requirements.* A license limitation groundfish license holder can elect to permanently add a catcher vessel endorsement for Pacific cod for the same gears and areas for which the license is currently endorsed, for the Western and/or Central GOA if the license holder—

(viii) *Catcher/processor participation in the Western GOA and Central GOA official record.* (A) The official record will contain all information used by the Regional Administrator to determine the following:


(*1*) The number and amount of legal landings made under the authority of that license by gear type, and operational mode;


(*2*) All other relevant information necessary to administer the requirements described in paragraphs (k)(10)(vii)(A)(*1*) through (k)(10)(vii)(A)(*3*) of this section.


(B) The official record is presumed to be correct. A groundfish license holder has the burden to prove otherwise.


(C) For the purposes of creating the official record, the Regional Administrator will presume if more than one person is claiming the same legal landing, that each groundfish license for which the legal landing is being claimed will be credited with the legal landing;


(D) Only legal landings as defined in § 679.2 and documented on State of Alaska Fish Tickets or NMFS weekly production reports will be used to assign legal landings to a groundfish license.


(E) The Regional Administrator will specify by letter a 30-day evidentiary period during which an applicant may provide additional information or evidence to amend or challenge the information in the official record. A person will be limited to one 30-day evidentiary period. Additional information or evidence received after the 30-day evidentiary period specified in the letter has expired will not be considered for purposes of the initial administrative determination.


(F) The Regional Administrator will prepare and send an IAD to the applicant following the expiration of the 30-day evidentiary period if the Regional Administrator determines that the information or evidence provided by the person fails to support the person's claims and is insufficient to rebut the presumption that the official record is correct, or if the additional information, evidence, or revised application is not provided within the time period specified in the letter that notifies the applicant of his or her 30-day evidentiary period. The IAD will indicate the deficiencies with the information, or the evidence submitted in support of the information. The IAD will also indicate which claims cannot be approved based on the available information or evidence. A person who receives an IAD may appeal pursuant to § 679.43. A person who avails himself or herself of the opportunity to appeal an IAD that is accepted by the National Appeals Office will receive a non-transferable license pending the final resolution of that appeal, notwithstanding the eligibility of that applicant for some claims based on consistent information in the official record.


(11) *Restrictions on licenses earned on AFA catcher vessels and listed AFA catcher/processors.* No person may use an LLP license that was derived in whole or in part from the qualifying fishing history of an AFA catcher vessel or a listed AFA catcher/processor to fish for groundfish or crab on a non-AFA catcher vessel or non-AFA catcher/processor. NMFS will identify all such licenses affected by this restriction and inform the holders of such licenses of this restriction through a restriction printed on the face of the license.


(12) *Rockfish QS*—(i) *General.* In addition to other requirements of this part, a license holder must have rockfish QS assigned to his or her groundfish LLP license to conduct directed fishing for rockfish primary species and rockfish secondary species with trawl gear.

(vi) *Process for issuing BSAI TLAS yellowfin sole endorsements.* (A) NMFS will issue to the holder of each groundfish LLP license endorsed to use trawl gear in the Bering Sea and designated in Column A of Table 52 to this part a notice of eligibility to receive a BSAI TLAS yellowfin sole directed fishery endorsement and a revised groundfish LLP license with a BSAI TLAS yellowfin sole directed fishery endorsement.


(B) NMFS will issue to the holder of each groundfish LLP license endorsed to use trawl gear in the Bering Sea and designated in Column A of Table 53 to this part a notice of eligibility to be credited with a legal trip target landing specified in (k)(14)(ii)(A)(*1*) of this section.


(*1*) NMFS will also issue to the owner of the vessel designated on the groundfish LLP licenses in Column A of Table 53 a notice of eligibility for the two listed groundfish LLP licenses to be credited with a legal trip target landing specified in (k)(14)(ii)(A)(*1*) of this section. The notice to the vessel owner will provide instructions for the vessel owner to select the one groundfish LLP license that NMFS is to credit with the legal trip target landing specified in (k)(14)(ii)(A)(*1*) of this section.


(*2*) The holder of a groundfish LLP license in Column A of Table 53 will receive a revised groundfish LLP license with a BSAI TLAS yellowfin sole directed fishery endorsement if:

For example, if a vessel sinks on February 15, 2016, the AFA permit on the vessel will be valid until December 31, 2021, unless the owner of the vessel replaces or removes the vessel before December 31, 2021; after December 31, 2021, the AFA permit on the lost vessel will be suspended until the AFA vessel owner replaces or removes the lost vessel;


(*ii*) The owner of the lost AFA vessel must notify NMFS in writing of the vessel loss within 120 days of the date of the total loss or constructive loss of the vessel;


(*iii*) For purposes of paragraph (l)(1)(ii)(B)(*3*) of this section, an AFA lost vessel is a vessel that has been subject to a total loss or a constructive loss; a total loss means that the vessel is physically lost such as from sinking or a fire; a constructive loss means that the vessel suffered damage so that the cost of repairing the vessel exceeded the value of the vessel; the date of the total loss of a vessel is the date on which the physical loss occurred; the date of the constructive loss of a vessel is the date on which the damage to the vessel occurred.

(C) *Surrender of AFA permits.* Except for AFA inshore processor permits, AFA permits may not be surrendered.


(iii) *Application for permit.* NMFS will issue AFA vessel and processor permits to the current owner(s) of a qualifying vessel or processor if the owner(s) submits to the Regional Administrator a completed AFA permit application that is subsequently approved.

The burden is on the applicant to establish that the vessel meets the criteria to become a replacement vessel.


(ii) *Additional information and evidence.* The Regional Administrator will evaluate the additional information or evidence to support an application for Amendment 80 replacement vessel submitted within the 30-day evidentiary period. If the Regional Administrator determines that the additional information or evidence meets the applicant's burden of proving that the vessel meets the requirements to become an Amendment 80 Replacement Vessel, the application will be approved.
