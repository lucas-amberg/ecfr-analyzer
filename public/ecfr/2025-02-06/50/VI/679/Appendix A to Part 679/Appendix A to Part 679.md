(c) *Types of Scales Covered by Appendix*—This appendix contains performance and technical requirements for belt, automatic hopper, platform, and hanging scales.


(d) *Testing and Approval of Scales Used to Weigh Catch at Sea*—Scales used to weigh catch at sea are required to comply with four categories of performance and technical requirements: (1) Type evaluation; (2) initial inspection after installation while the vessel is tied up at a dock and is not under power at sea; (3) annual reinspection while the vessel is tied up at a dock and is not under power at sea; and (4) daily at-sea tests of the scale's accuracy. This appendix contains only the performance and technical requirements for type evaluation and initial and annual reinspections by an authorized scale inspector.
