# ยง 115.141   Assessment for risk of victimization and abusiveness.

(a) Before placing any detainees together in a holding facility, agency staff shall consider whether, based on the information before them, a detainee may be at a high risk of being sexually abused and, when appropriate, shall take necessary steps to mitigate any such danger to the detainee.


(b) All detainees who may be held overnight with other detainees shall be assessed to determine their risk of being sexually abused by other detainees or sexually abusive toward other detainees; staff shall ask each such detainee about his or her own concerns about his or her physical safety.


(c) The agency shall also consider, to the extent that the information is available, the following criteria to assess detainees for risk of sexual victimization:


(1) Whether the detainee has a mental, physical, or developmental disability;


(2) The age of the detainee;


(3) The physical build and appearance of the detainee;


(4) Whether the detainee has previously been incarcerated or detained;


(5) The nature of the detainee's criminal history; and


(6) Whether the detainee has any convictions for sex offenses against an adult or child;


(7) Whether the detainee has self-identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, intersex, or gender nonconforming;


(8) Whether the detainee has self-identified as having previously experienced sexual victimization; and


(9) The detainee's own concerns about his or her physical safety.


(d) If detainees are identified pursuant to the assessment under this section to be at high risk of victimization, staff shall provide such detainees with heightened protection, to include continuous direct sight and sound supervision, single-cell housing, or placement in a cell actively monitored on video by a staff member sufficiently proximate to intervene, unless no such option is determined to be feasible.


(e) The facility shall implement appropriate controls on the dissemination of sensitive information provided by detainees under this section.
