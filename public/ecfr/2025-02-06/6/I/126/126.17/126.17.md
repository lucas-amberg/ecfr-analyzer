# ยง 126.17   Procedures for classified information, Sensitive Security Information (SSI), and other protected information.

(a) *Notice of protected information.* Within 30 calendar days of filing or being served with a notice of appeal, TSA must file a notice of protected information indicating whether the record of proceedings before the ALJ contains classified information, SSI, or other protected information. The notice of protected information must be filed with the TSOB Docket Clerk in accordance with ยง 126.13(b). If the TSA presented classified information, SSI, or other protected information to the ALJ at an ex parte proceeding or provided such information for in camera review during the ALJ proceedings, then the TSOB Review Panel will also consider that information at an ex parte proceeding or in camera.


(b) *Access to protected information.* A TSOB Review Panel may not disclose Classified Information or other protected information to any non-government party or counsel. A TSOB Review Panel may not disclose SSI to any non-government party or counsel unless the TSA has determined that the party had a preexisting need to know specific SSI as a covered person pursuant to 49 CFR 1520.7 and 1520.11.
