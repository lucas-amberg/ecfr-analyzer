# § 158.621   Adjusting salaries.

(a) The Department adjusts a DHS-CS employee's salary, or the salaries of a group of DHS-CS employees, by paying a recognition adjustment under § 158.631, or paying a local cybersecurity talent market supplement under § 158.612, or both.


(b) The Department does not provide DHS-CS employees with any automatic salary increase or any salary increase based on length of service in the DHS-CS or in any position outside the DHS-CS.


(c) If the Department adjusts a salary structure under § 158.611(e) that results in an increase to the salary minimum for one or more subranges of the salary structure, for any DHS-CS employee receiving a salary in an affected subrange at the affected salary minimum, DHS adjusts the employee's salary to reflect the adjustment to the salary structure and the new salary minimum for the affected subrange. Such a salary adjustment is not considered a recognition adjustment under § 158.631.
