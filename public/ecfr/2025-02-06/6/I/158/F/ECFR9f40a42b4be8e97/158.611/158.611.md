(b) A salary structure:


(1) Is bounded by the salary range described in § 158.613;


(2) Incorporates, as described in paragraph (d) of this section, the salary limitations described in § 158.614; and


(3) May incorporate other salary and cost control strategies, such as control points.


(c) A salary structure includes subranges, within the salary range described in § 158.613 that are associated with work levels established by the work valuation system, described in § 158.404. Each such subrange is associated with at least one such work level.
