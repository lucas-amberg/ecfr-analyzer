# § 158.630   Employee recognition.

(a) *DHS-CS employees.* In alignment with the compensation strategy in § 158.601 and the performance management program described in § 158.802 of this part, the Department may provide recognition under §§ 158.631 through 158.634, on a periodic or *ad hoc* basis, to a DHS-CS employee based on the employee's mission impact. In providing such recognition, the Department may also consider mission-related requirements and strategic talent priorities.


(b) *Prospective employees.* In alignment with the compensation strategy in § 158.601, the Department may offer, and provide upon appointment, recognition payments under § 158.632(b) and recognition time-off under § 158.633(b), on a periodic or *ad hoc* basis, to an individual selected for employment in the DHS-CS based on:


(1) The individual's CTMS qualifications determined under the assessment program described in § 158.520;


(2) The individual's anticipated mission impact;


(3) Mission-related requirements; and


(4) Strategic talent priorities.


(c) *Eligibility.* The Department determines eligibility for recognition under this section, §§ 158.631 through 158.634, and CTMS policy implementing this section. The Department may defer providing recognition to a DHS-CS employee under this part if the Department is in the process of determining whether the employee's performance is unacceptable, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 4301(3), or whether the employee has engaged in misconduct. If the Department determines a DHS-CS employee's performance is unacceptable, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 4301(3), or the employee receives an unacceptable rating of record under § 158.804, or the Department determines the employee has engaged in misconduct, the employee is ineligible to receive recognition under this part.


(d) *Policy.* CTMS policy implementing this section addresses:


(1) Eligibility criteria;


(2) Requirements for documenting the reason and basis for recognition provided to a DHS-CS employee;


(3) Appropriate levels of review and approval for providing recognition;


(4) Any limitations on the total number, frequency, or amount of recognition a DHS-CS employee may receive within any specific time period;


(5) Any service agreement requirements; and


(6) Processes for evaluating the effectiveness of recognition in supporting the purpose of CTMS described in § 158.101, the purpose of the DHS-CS described in § 158.202, and the operationalization of the compensation strategy described in § 158.601.
