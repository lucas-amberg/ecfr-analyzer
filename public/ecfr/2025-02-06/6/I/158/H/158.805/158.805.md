(1) Superior application of CTMS qualifications to perform DHS-CS cybersecurity work;


(2) Significant enhancements to CTMS qualifications;


(3) Special contributions to cybersecurity technologies, techniques, tactics, or procedures; and


(4) Notable improvements to execution of the DHS cybersecurity mission.


(c) The Department uses mission impact summary information to make distinctions among DHS-CS employees, such as comparing, categorizing, and ranking DHS-CS employees on the basis of mission impact to support decisions related to recognition for DHS-CS employees under §§ 158.630 through 158.634.
