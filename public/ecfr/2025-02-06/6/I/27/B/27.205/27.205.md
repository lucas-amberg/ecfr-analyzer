# § 27.205   Determination that a chemical facility “presents a high level of security risk.”

(a) *Initial determination.* The Executive Assistant Director may determine at any time that a chemical facility presents a high level of security risk based on any information available (including any information submitted to the Department under § 27.200) that, in the Secretary's discretion, indicates the potential that a terrorist attack involving the facility could result in significant adverse consequences for human life or health, national security, or critical economic assets. Upon determining that a facility presents a high level of security risk, the Department shall notify the facility in writing of such initial determination and may also notify the facility of the Department's preliminary determination of the facility's placement in a risk-based tier pursuant to § 27.220(a).


(b) *Redetermination.* If a covered facility previously determined to present a high level of security risk has materially altered its operations, it may seek a redetermination by filing a Request for Redetermination with the Executive Assistant Director, and may request a meeting regarding the Request. Within 45 calendar days of receipt of such a Request, or within 45 calendar days of a meeting under this paragraph, the Executive Assistant Director shall notify the covered facility in writing of the Department's decision on the Request for Redetermination.
