(ii) A writing that accompanied the solicitation of an offer or a sale of securities; and


(2) Information or statements previously submitted to DHS in the course of a regulatory proceeding or a licensing or permitting determination are not “voluntarily submitted.” In addition, the submission of information to DHS for purposes of seeking a federal preference or benefit, including CII submitted to support an application for a DHS grant to secure critical infrastructure will be considered a voluntary submission of information. Applications for Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002 filed pursuant to 6 U.S.C. 441 *et seq.,* or SAFETY Act Designation or Certification under 6 CFR part 25, will also be considered a voluntary submission.
