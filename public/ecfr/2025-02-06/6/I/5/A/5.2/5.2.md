# ยง 5.2   Proactive disclosure of DHS records.

Records that are required by the FOIA to be made available for public inspection in an electronic format are accessible on DHS's Web site, *http://www.dhs.gov/freedom-information-act-foia-and-privacy-act.* Each component is responsible for determining which of its records are required to be made publicly available, as well as identifying additional records of interest to the public that are appropriate for public disclosure, and for posting and indexing such records. Each component shall ensure that posted records and indices are updated on an ongoing basis. Each component has a FOIA Public Liaison who can assist individuals in locating records particular to a component. A list of DHS's FOIA Public Liaisons is available at *http://www.dhs.gov/foia-contact-information* and in appendix A to this part. Requesters who do not have access to the internet may contact the Public Liaison for the component from which they seek records for assistance with publicly available records.
