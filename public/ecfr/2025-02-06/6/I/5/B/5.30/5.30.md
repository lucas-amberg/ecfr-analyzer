# § 5.30   Notice of court-ordered and emergency disclosures.

(a) *Court-ordered disclosures.* When the component discloses an individual's information covered by a system of records pursuant to an order from a court of competent jurisdiction, and the order is a matter of public record, the Privacy Act requires the component to send a notice of the disclosure to the last known address of the person whose record was disclosed. Notice will be given within a reasonable time after the component's receipt of the order, except that in a case in which the order is not a matter of public record, the notice will be given only after the order becomes public. This notice will be mailed to the individual's last known address and will contain a copy of the order and a description of the information disclosed. Notice will not be given if disclosure is made from a criminal law enforcement system of records that has been exempted from the notice requirement.


(b) *Court.* For purposes of this section, a court is an institution of the judicial branch of the U.S. Federal Government consisting of one or more judges who seek to adjudicate disputes and administer justice. Entities not in the judicial branch of the Federal Government are not courts for purposes of this section.


(c) *Court order.* For purposes of this section, a court order is any legal process which satisfies all the following conditions:


(1) It is issued under the authority of a Federal court;


(2) A judge or a magistrate judge of that court signs it;


(3) It commands or permits DHS to disclose the Privacy Act protected information at issue; and


(4) The court is a court of competent jurisdiction.


(d) *Court of competent jurisdiction.* It is the view of DHS that under the Privacy Act the Federal Government has not waived sovereign immunity, which precludes state court jurisdiction over a Federal agency or official. Therefore, DHS will not honor state court orders as a basis for disclosure, unless DHS does so under its own discretion.


(e) *Conditions for disclosure under a court order of competent jurisdiction.* The component may disclose information in compliance with an order of a court of competent jurisdiction if—


(1) Another section of this part specifically allows such disclosure, or


(2) DHS, the Secretary, or any officer or employee of DHS in their official capacity is properly a party in the proceeding, or


(3) Disclosure of the information is necessary to ensure that an individual who is accused of criminal activity receives due process of law in a criminal proceeding under the jurisdiction of the judicial branch of the Federal Government.


(f) *In other circumstances.* DHS may disclose information to a court of competent jurisdiction in circumstances other than those stated in paragraph (e) of this section. DHS will make its decision regarding disclosure by balancing the needs of a court while preserving the confidentiality of information. For example, DHS may disclose information under a court order that restricts the use and redisclosure of the information by the participants in the proceeding; DHS may offer the information for inspection by the court *in camera* and under seal; or DHS may arrange for the court to exclude information identifying individuals from that portion of the record of the proceedings that is available to the public.


(g) *Emergency disclosures.* Upon disclosing a record pertaining to an individual made under compelling circumstances affecting the health or safety of an individual, the component will notify the individual to whom the record pertains of the disclosure. This notice will be mailed to the individual's last known address and will state the nature of the information disclosed; the person, organization, or agency to which it was disclosed; the date of disclosure; and the compelling circumstances justifying the disclosure.


(h) *Other regulations on disclosure of information in litigation.* See subpart C to this part for additional rules covering disclosure of information and records governed by this part and requested in connection with legal proceedings.
