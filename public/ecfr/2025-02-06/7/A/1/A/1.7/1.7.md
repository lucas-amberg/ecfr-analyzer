# ยง 1.7   Records responsive to records requests.

(a) In determining which records are responsive to a request, a component ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date that the component begins its search.


(b) A component is not required to create a new record in order to fulfill a request for records. The FOIA does not require agencies to do research, to analyze data, or to answer written questions in response to a request.


(c) Creation of records may be undertaken voluntarily.


(d) A component will provide a record in the format specified by a requester, if the record is readily reproducible by the component in the format requested.
