(j) Establish appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to insure the security and confidentiality of records and to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to their security or integrity which could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to any individual on whom information is maintained. 


_Sec. 2._*Amendment of routine uses for an existing system of records, or establishment of a new system of records.*

(a) Any agency which intends to add a routine use, or amend an existing one, in a system of records it maintains, shall, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(11), ensure that at least 30 days advance notice of such action is given by publication in the _Federal Register_ and an opportunity provided for interested persons to submit written data, views or arguments to the agency. 


(b) Any agency which intends to establish a new system of records, or to alter any existing system of records, shall insure that adequate advance notice is provided to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget to permit an evaluation of the probable or potential effect of such action on the privacy and other personal or property rights of individuals or the disclosure of information relating to such individuals, and its effect on the preservation of the constitutional principles of federalism and separation of powers. Such notice is required for any new system of records and for any alteration in an existing one which will: 


(1) Increase the number or types of individuals on whom records are maintained; 


(2) Expand the type or amount of information maintained; 


(3) Increase the number or categories of agencies or other persons who may have access to those records; 


(4) Alter the manner in which the records are organized so as to change the nature or scope of those records (e.g., the combining of two or more existing systems); 


(5) Modify the way the system operates at its location(s) in such a manner as to alter the procedures by which individuals can exercise their rights under this subpart; or 


(6) Change the equipment configuration on which the system is operated so as to create the potential for greater access (e.g., adding a telecommunications capability). 


_Sec. 3._*Accounting of certain disclosures.* Each agency, with respect to each system of records under its control, shall:

(c) Except for disclosures made under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(7), make the accounting required under paragraph (a) of this section available to the individual named in the record at his or her request. 


_Sec. 4._*Government contractors.* When an agency within the Department provides by a contract for the operation by or on behalf of the agency of a system of records to accomplish an agency function, the agency shall, consistent with its authority, cause the requirements of this subpart to be applied to such system. For purposes of 5 U.S.C. 552a(i) any such contractor or any employee of such contractor shall be considered to be an employee of an agency and therefore subject to the criminal penalties set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552a(i). 


_Sec. 5._*Mailing lists.* No agency within the Department shall sell or rent any individual's name and address unless such action is specifically authorized by law. This section shall not be construed to require, or to authorize, the withholding of names and addresses whose disclosure is required by 5 U.S.C. 552. 


_Sec. 6._*Social security account numbers.* (a) No agency shall deny, or permit any State or local government with whom it is involved in a cooperative venture to deny, to any individual any right, benefit, or privilege provided by law because of such individual's refusal to disclose his or her social security account number.

(1) Any disclosure required by Federal statute; or 


(2) Any disclosure to any agency relating to a system of records it maintained prior to January 1, 1975, if such disclosure was required under statute or regulation adopted prior to that date, to verify the identity of an individual. 


(c) Any agency in the Department which requests an individual to disclose his or her social security account number shall inform that individual whether the disclosure is mandatory or voluntary, by what statutory or other authority the number is solicited, and what uses will be made of it. The agency shall also insure that this information is provided by a State or local government with whom it is involved in a cooperative agreement. 


_Sec. 7._*Annual report.* Each agency in the Department shall submit to the Office of the General Counsel prior to March 30 of each year a report containing the following information related to implementation of 5 U.S.C. 552a: 


(a) A summary of major accomplishments; 


(b) A summary of major plans for activities in the upcoming year; 


(c) A list of the systems which were exempted during the year from any of the operative provisions of this subpart pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a (j) and (k), whether or not the exemption was effected during that year, the number of instances with respect to each system exempted in which the exemption was invoked to deny access, and the reasons for invoking the exemption; 


(d) A brief summary of changes to the total inventory of personal data system subject to this subpart including reasons for major changes; and

(2) Refusing to provide information; 


(3) Requesting access to their records; 


(4) Appealing initial refusals to amend records; and
