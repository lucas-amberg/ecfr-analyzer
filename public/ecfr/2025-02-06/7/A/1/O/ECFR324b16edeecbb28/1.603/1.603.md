(3) If the period is less than 7 days, any Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday that falls within the period is not included.


(b) *Extensions of time.* (1) No extension of time can be granted to file a request for a hearing under § 1.621, a notice of intervention and response under § 1.622, an answer under § 1.625, or any document under §§ 1.670 through 1.674.

(ii) The party must file the motion before the applicable time period expires, unless the party demonstrates extraordinary circumstances that justify a delay in filing.


(iii) The ALJ may grant the extension only if:


(A) It would not unduly prejudice other parties; and


(B) It would not delay the decision under § 1.660.
