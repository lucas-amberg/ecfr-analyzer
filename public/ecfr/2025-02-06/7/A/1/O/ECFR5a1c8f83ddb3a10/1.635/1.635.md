# § 1.635   What are the requirements for motions?

(a) *General.* Any party may apply for an order or ruling on any matter related to the hearing process by presenting a motion to the ALJ. A motion may be presented any time after the Hearing Clerk issues a docketing notice under § 1.630.


(1) A motion made at a hearing may be stated orally on the record, unless the ALJ directs that it be reduced to writing.


(2) Any other motion must:


(i) Be in writing;


(ii) Comply with the requirements of §§ 1.610 through 1.613 with respect to form, content, filing, and service; and


(iii) Not exceed 15 pages, including all supporting arguments.


(b) *Content.* (1) Each motion must state clearly and concisely:


(i) Its purpose and the relief sought;


(ii) The facts constituting the grounds for the relief sought; and


(iii) Any applicable statutory or regulatory authority.


(2) A proposed order must accompany the motion.


(c) *Response.* Except as otherwise required by this part, any other party may file a response to a written motion within 10 days after service of the motion. The response may not exceed 15 pages, including all supporting arguments. When a party presents a motion at a hearing, any other party may present a response orally on the record.


(d) *Reply.* Unless the ALJ orders otherwise, no reply to a response may be filed.


(e) *Effect of filing.* Unless the ALJ orders otherwise, the filing of a motion does not stay the hearing process.


(f) *Ruling.* The ALJ will rule on the motion as soon as practicable, either orally on the record or in writing. He or she may summarily deny any dilatory, repetitive, or frivolous motion.
