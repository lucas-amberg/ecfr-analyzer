# § 12.8   Affiliated persons.

(a) *Ineligibility of affiliated persons.* Ineligibility of an individual or entity under this part for benefits shall also be an ineligibility for benefits for “affiliated persons” as defined in this section.


(b) *Affiliated persons of an individual.* If the person requesting benefits is an individual, the affiliated persons are:


(1) The spouse and minor child of such person or guardian of such child; except that spouses who establish to the satisfaction of the COC that operations of the husband and wife are maintained separately and independently shall not be considered affiliates;


(2) Any partnership, joint venture, or other enterprise in which the person or any person listed in paragraphs (b)(1) has an ownership interest or financial interest; unless such interest is held indirectly through another business enterprise; or


(3) Any trust in which the individual, business enterprise, or any person listed in paragraph (b)(1) is a beneficiary or has a financial interest, unless such interest is held indirectly through another business enterprise.


(c) *Affiliated persons of an entity.* If the person who has requested benefits from USDA is a corporation, partnership, or other joint venture, the affiliated persons are any participant or stockholder therein of the corporation, partnership, or other joint venture, except for persons who have an indirect interest through another business enterprise in such corporation, partnership, or other joint venture or persons with a 20 percent or less share in a corporation.


(d) *Limitation.* Any reduction in payments which results only from the application of the affiliation provisions of this section to a partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise shall be limited to the extent of interest held in such partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise by the person or business enterprise that committed the violation. However, for violations for which the business enterprise is considered directly responsible under the provisions of this part, the business enterprise shall be subject to a full loss of benefits, including those instances in which the business enterprise has an interest in the land where the violation occurred or where the business enterprise had an interest in the crops produced on the land.


(e) *Avoidance of this part.* Limitations on affiliation shall not apply as needed to correct for any action that would otherwise tend to defeat the purposes of this part.
