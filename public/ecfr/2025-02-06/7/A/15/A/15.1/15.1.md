# § 15.1   Purpose and application of part.

(a) The purpose of the regulations in this part is to effectuate the provisions of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (hereinafter referred to as the “Act”) to the end that no person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity of an applicant or recipient receiving Federal financial assistance from the Department of Agriculture or any Agency thereof. 


(b) The regulations in this part apply to any program or activity of an applicant or recipient for which Federal financial assistance is authorized under a law administered by the Department including, but not limited to, the Federal financial assistance listed in the appendix to this part. They apply to money paid, property transferred, or other Federal financial assistance extended to an applicant or recipient for its program or activity after the effective date of these regulations pursuant to an application approved or statutory or other provision made therefor prior to such effective date. The regulations in this part do not apply to (1) any Federal financial assistance by way of insurance or guaranty contract, (2) money paid, property transferred, or other assistance extended prior to the effective date of the regulations in this part, (3) any assistance to an applicant or recipient who is an ultimate beneficiary, or (4) except as provided in § 15.3(c), any employment practice of any employer, employment agency or labor organization. The fact that a specific kind of Federal financial assistance is not listed in the appendix, shall not mean, if title VI of the Act is otherwise applicable, that such Federal financial assistance is not covered. Other Federal financial assistance under statutes now in force or hereinafter enacted may be added to this list by notice approved and issued by the Secretary and published in the _Federal Register._
