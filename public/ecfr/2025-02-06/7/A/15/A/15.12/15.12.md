# ยง 15.12   Effect on other regulations; forms and instructions.

(a) *Effect on other regulations.* All regulations, orders, or like directions heretofore issued by any officer of the Department which impose requirements designed to prohibit any discrimination against individuals on the ground of race, color, or national origin under any program to which the regulations in this part apply, and which authorize the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance to any applicant for or recipient of such assistance for failure to comply with such requirements, are hereby superseded to the extent that such discrimination is prohibited by the regulations in this part, except that nothing in the regulations in this part shall be deemed to relieve any person of any obligation assumed or imposed under any such superseded regulation, order, instruction, or like direction prior to the effective date of the regulations in this part. Nothing in these regulations, however, shall be deemed to supersede any of the following including future amendments thereof: 


(1) Executive Order 11246 and regulations issued thereunder; or 


(2) Executive Order 11063 and regulations issued thereunder or any other regulations or instructions insofar as they prohibit discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in any program or situation to which the regulations in this part are inapplicable, or prohibit discrimination on any other ground. 


(b) *Forms and instructions.* Each Agency shall issue and promptly make available forms and such implementing instructions and procedures consistent with the regulations in this part as may be necessary. Each Agency in making available Federal financial assistance to any program or activity may utilize contractual commitments in obtaining compliance with the regulations in this part, including obtaining compliance by recipients other than the contracting recipient. 


(c) *Supervision and coordination.* The Secretary may from time to time assign to officials of other Departments or Agencies of the Government with the consent of such Department or Agency, responsibilities in connection with the effectuation of the purposes of title VI of the Act and the regulations in this part (other than responsibility for final decision as provided in ยง 15.10) including the achievement of effective coordination and maximum uniformity within the Department and within the Executive Branch of the Government in the application of title VI and these regulations to similar programs and in similar situations. Any action taken, determination made, or requirement imposed by an official of another Department or Agency acting under this paragraph shall have the same effect as though such action had been taken by the Secretary or any Agency of this Department.
