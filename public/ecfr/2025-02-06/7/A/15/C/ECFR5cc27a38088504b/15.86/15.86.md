Two or more proceedings against the same respondent, or against different respondents in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance, may be consolidated for hearing or decision or both by the agency head, if he has the principal responsibility within the Department for the administration of all the laws extending the Federal financial assistance involved. If laws administered by more than one agency head are involved, such officials may by agreement order consolidation for hearing. The Secretary may order proceedings in the Department consolidated for hearing with proceedings in other Federal Departments or agencies, by agreement with such other Departments or agencies. All parties to any proceeding consolidated subsequently to service of the notice of hearing or notice of opportunity to request a hearing shall be promptly served with notice of such consolidation.
