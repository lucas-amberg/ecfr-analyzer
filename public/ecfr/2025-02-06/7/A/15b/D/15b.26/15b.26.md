(b) *Counseling services.* A recipient to which this subpart applies that provides personal, academic, or vocational counseling, guidance, or placement services to its students shall provide these services without discrimination on the basis of handicap.

A recipient that offers physical education courses or that operates or sponsors interscholastic, club, or intramural athletics shall provide to qualified handicapped students an equal opportunity for participation.


(2) A recipient may offer handicapped students physical education and athletic activities that are separate or different from those offered to nonhandicapped students only if separation or differentiation is consistent with requirements of ยง 15b.23, and only if no qualified handicapped student is denied the opportunity to compete for teams or to participate in courses that are not separate or different.


(d) *Food services.* In providing food services to any of its students, a recipient to which this subpart applies may not discriminate on the basis of handicap. (1) Recipients shall serve special meals, at no extra charge, to students whose handicap restricts their diet. Recipients may require students to provide medical certification that special meals are needed because of their handicap.


(2) Where existing food service facilities are not completely accessible and usable, recipients may provide aides or use other equally effective methods to serve food to handicapped persons. Recipients shall provide all food services in the most intergrated setting appropriate to the needs of handicapped persons as required by ยง 15b.23(b).
