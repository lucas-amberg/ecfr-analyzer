(2) The agency issues any finding in favor of the recipient.


(b) Before commencing the action, the complainant shall give 30 days' notice by registered mail to the Secretary of HHS, the Attorney General of the United States, the head of the granting USDA agency, and the recipient stating the alleged violation of the Age Act, the relief requested, the court in which the action will be brought, and whether or not attorney's fees are demanded in the event the complainant prevails.
