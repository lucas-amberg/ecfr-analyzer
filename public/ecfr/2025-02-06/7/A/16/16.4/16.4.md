# ยง 16.4   Responsibilities of participating organizations.

(a) Any organization that receives direct or indirect Federal financial assistance shall not, with respect to services supported in whole or in part with Federal financial assistance, or in their outreach activities related to such services, discriminate against a current or prospective program beneficiary on the basis of religion, religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice. However, an organization that participates in a program funded by indirect financial assistance need not modify its program activities to accommodate a beneficiary who chooses to expend the indirect aid on the organization's program.






(b) Organizations that receive USDA direct assistance under any USDA program may not engage in explicitly religious activities, including activities that involve overt religious content such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization, as part of the programs or services funded by USDA direct assistance. If an organization conducts such activities, the activities must be offered separately, in time or location, from the programs or services supported with USDA direct assistance, and participation must be voluntary for beneficiaries of the programs or services supported with such USDA direct assistance. The use of indirect Federal financial assistance is not subject to this restriction. Nothing in this part restricts the Department's authority under applicable Federal law to fund activities that can be directly funded by the Government consistent with the Establishment Clause.




(c)(1) All organizations that receive USDA direct assistance under any domestic USDA program must give written notice to all beneficiaries and prospective beneficiaries of certain protections in a manner and form prescribed by USDA. The required language for this written notice to beneficiaries is set forth in appendix C to this part. This notice must include the following information:


(i) The organization may not discriminate against beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries on the basis of religion, a religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice;


(ii) The organization may not require beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries to attend or participate in any explicitly religious activities that are offered by the organization, and any participation by beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries in such activities must be purely voluntary;


(iii) The organization must separate in time or location any privately funded explicitly religious activities from activities supported by direct Federal financial assistance; and


(iv) Beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries may report violations of these protections (including denials of services or benefits) by an organization by contacting or filing a written complaint with USDA's Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights.


(2) The USDA awarding agency may determine that this written notice must also inform beneficiaries and prospective beneficiaries about how to obtain information from the awarding agency about other federally funded service providers in their area that provide the services available under the applicable program.


(3) This written notice must be given to beneficiaries prior to the time they enroll in the program or receive services from the program. When the nature of the service provided or exigent circumstances make it impracticable to provide such written notice in advance of the actual service, service providers must advise beneficiaries of their protections at the earliest available opportunity.




(d) A beneficiary or prospective beneficiary in a program supported by indirect Federal financial assistance may report an organization's violation of the religious protections in this part, including any denials of services or benefits by an organization, by contacting or filing a written complaint with USDA's Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights.




(e) Nothing in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section shall be construed to prevent faith-based organizations that receive USDA assistance under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, 42 U.S.C. 1751 *et seq.,* the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, 42 U.S.C. 1771 *et seq.,* or USDA international school feeding programs from considering religion in their admissions practices or from imposing religious attendance or curricular requirements at their schools.
