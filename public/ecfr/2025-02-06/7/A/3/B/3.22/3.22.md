# ยง 3.22   CCC withholding of payment.

(a) CCC may temporarily withhold issuance of payment of some or all amounts to a debtor under one or more contracts or programs. Withholding of a payment prior to the completion of an applicable offset procedure may be made from amounts payable to a debtor by CCC to ensure that the interests of CCC and the United States will be protected as provided in this section.


(b) A payment may be withheld to protect the interests of CCC or the United States if CCC determines that:


(1) There has been a serious breach of contract or violation of program requirements and the withholding action is considered necessary to protect the financial interests of CCC;


(2) There is substantial evidence of violations of criminal or civil fraud laws and criminal prosecution or civil fraud action is of primary importance to program operations of CCC;


(3) Prior experience with the debtor indicates that collection will be difficult if amounts payable to the debtor are not withheld;


(4) There is doubt that the debtor will be financially able to pay a judgment on the claim of CCC;


(5) The facts available to CCC are insufficient to determine the amount to be offset or the proper payee;


(6) A judgement on a claim of CCC has been obtained; or


(7) Such action has been requested by Justice.
