# § 6.43   Determinations.

(a) *Making determinations.* Not later than 30 days after receiving an acceptable complaint, as described in § 6.42(b), alleging price-undercutting, the Secretary shall make a determination as to the validity of the allegation. In making such determination, the following shall apply:


(1) The “domestic wholesale market” shall be one or more of the three major U.S. market areas, viz., New York City, Chicago, and San Francisco, and/or any other market area within the Customs Territory of the United States, which the Investigating Authority determines most representative of the area specified by the complainant as the one in which price-undercutting is alleged to be occurring (hereinafter referred to as “designated area”).


(2) The “duty-paid wholesale price” determined by the Investigating Authority shall be the average of prices at which wholesalers have sold or offered for sale in the designated area the article of quota cheese alleged to be involved in price-undercutting, as obtained in a survey directed by the Investigating Authority during the investigation: *Provided,* That whenever the designated area is not or does not include one of the major market areas specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Investigating Authority may adjust the average of prices determined for such designated area on the basis of the average of prices determined for the major market area which is determined to be the most representative of the designated area, taking into consideration any special factors which may be affecting prices in the designated area.


(3) The “domestic wholesale market price” determined by the Investigating Authority for a similar article produced in the United States to that article of quota cheese which is alleged to be involved in price-undercutting shall be the average of prices at which wholesalers have sold the similar article produced in the United States in the designated area, as obtained in a survey directed by the Investigating Authority during the investigation: *Provided,* That whenever the designated area is not or does not include one of the major market areas specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Investigating Authority may adjust the average of prices determined for such designated area on the basis of the average of prices determined for the major market area which is determined to be the most representative of the designated area, taking into consideration any special factors which may be affecting prices in the designated area.


(4) “Similar article produced in the United States” shall be an article of cheese, cheese product, or imitation cheese produced in the United States and marketed in the domestic wholesale market, which is determined by the Investigating Authority, based upon available information to be most like the imported article of quota cheese alleged to be involved in price-undercutting, in terms of its physical properties and end use. In making this determination, first consideration shall be given to the normal end uses of the article produced in the United States in comparison with the end use of the article of quota cheese alleged to be involved in price-undercutting. If the end use of both articles is determined to be the same (e.g., processing or retail sale), the physical characteristics of the two articles shall be considered.


(b) *Reporting determinations.* Determinations by the Secretary as to the validity of allegations of price-undercutting made under this subpart shall be published in the _Federal Register_ not later than 5 days after the date the determination is made.
