(d) The regulations in 7 CFR part 718, subpart D, and 7 CFR parts 11 and 780 apply to determinations made under this subpart.


(e) A producer, whether a person or legal entity that either fails to timely provide all required documentation or fails to satisfy any eligibility requirement for PARP, is not eligible to receive PARP payments, directly or indirectly.
