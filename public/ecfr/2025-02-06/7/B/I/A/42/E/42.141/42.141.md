# § 42.141   Obtaining Operating Characteristic (OC) curve information for skip lot sampling and inspection.

The Operating Characteristic (OC) curve information (probability of acceptance) for skip lot sampling and inspection procedures described in § 42.121 is easily obtained from the single curve in § 42.142. The procedure for using the curve in § 42.142 is as follows:


(a) Select any sampling plan for normal condition of container inspection from Table I or Table I-A of § 42.109.


(b) For a given Quality of Submitted Lots, 100_p_, find the Percent of Lots Expected to be Accepted, Pa from the respective OC curve in § 42.140.


(c) Refer to § 42.142 with this Percent of Lots Expected to be Accepted, Pa, and read the new Percent of Lots Expected to be Accepted, Pas, which results when using these skip lot procedures.
