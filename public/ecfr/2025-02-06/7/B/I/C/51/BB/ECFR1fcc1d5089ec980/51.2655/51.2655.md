The following specific defects shall be considered as damage:


(a) Cracks within the stem cavity when deep or not well healed, or when the appearance is affected to a greater extent than that of a cherry which has a superficial well healed crack one-sixteenth inch in width extending one-half the greatest circumference of the stem cavity;


(b) Cracks outside of the stem cavity when deep or not well healed, or when the crack has weakened the cherry to the extent that it is likely to split or break in the process of proper grading, packing, and handling, or when materially affecting the appearance;


(c) Hail injury when deep or not well healed, or when the aggregate area exceeds the area of a circle three-sixteenths inch in diameter;


(d) Insects when scale or more than one scale mark is present, or when the appearance is materially affected by any insect;


(e) Limbrubs when affecting the appearance of the cherry to a greater extent than the amount of scarring permitted;


(f) Pulled stems when the skin or flesh is torn, or when the cherry is leaking;


(g) Russeting when affecting the appearance of the cherry to a greater extent than the amount of scarring permitted;


(h) Scars when excessively deep or rough or dark colored and the aggregate area exceeds the area of a circle three-sixteenths inch in diameter, or when smooth or fairly smooth, light colored and superficial and the aggregate area exceeds the area of a circle one-fourth inch in diameter;


(i) Skin breaks when not well healed or when the appearance of the cherry is materially affected; and,


(j) Sutures when excessively deep or when affecting the shape of the cherry to the extent that it is not well formed.
