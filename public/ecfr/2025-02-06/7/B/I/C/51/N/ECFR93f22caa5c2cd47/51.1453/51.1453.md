# § 51.1453   Serious damage.

*Serious damage* means any specific defect described in this section; or an equally objectionable variation of any one of these defects, or any other defect, or any combination of defects, which seriously detracts from the appearance or the edible or marketing quality of the individual portion of kernel or of the lot as a whole. The following defects shall be considered as serious damage:


(a) Adhering material from inside the shell when attached to more than one-half of the surface on one side of the half-kernel or piece;


(b) Any plainly visible mold;


(c) Dark kernel spots when more than three are on the kernel, or when any dark kernel spot or the aggregate of two or more spots affect an area of more than 10 percent of the surface of the half-kernel or piece;


(d) Dark skin discoloration, darker than “dark brown,” when covering more than one-fourth of the surface of the half-kernel or piece;


(e) Decay affecting any portion of the kernel;


(f) Insects, web, or frass or any distinct evidence of insect feeding on the kernel;


(g) Internal discoloration, which is dark gray, dark brown, or black and extends more than one-third the length of the half-kernel or piece; and


(h) Rancidity when the kernel is distinctly rancid to taste. Staleness of flavor shall not be classed as rancidity.
