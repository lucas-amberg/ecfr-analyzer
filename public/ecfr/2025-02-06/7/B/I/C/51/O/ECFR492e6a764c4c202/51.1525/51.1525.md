In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and handling in each of the following grades, the following tolerances, by count, based on a minimum 50-count sample, except when packages contain less than 50 fruit, a minimum 25-count sample shall be examined, (when packages contain less than 25 fruit adjoining packages shall be opened to obtain the 25-count minimum sample), are provided as specified:


(a) *U.S. Fancy and U.S. No. 1*—(1) *For defects of plums or prunes other than Italian type prunes at shipping point.*1 8 percent for fruit which fails to meet the requirements of the specified grade: *Provided,* That included in this amount not more than 4 percent shall be allowed for defects causing serious damage, including in this latter amount not more than one-half of 1 percent for fruit which is affected by decay.


(2) *For defects of plums or prunes other than Italian type prunes en route or at destination.* 12 percent for fruit which fails to meet the requirements of the specified grade: *Provided,* That included in this amount not more than the following percentages shall be allowed for defects listed:


(i) 8 percent for permanent defects;


(ii) 6 percent for defects causing serious damage, including therein not more than 4 percent for serious damage by permanent defects and not more than 2 percent for decay.


(3) *For defects of Italian type prunes at shipping point.*1 Not more than a total of 12 percent of the fruit in any lot may fail to meet the requirements of the specified grade: *Provided,* That included in this amount not more than the following percentages shall be allowed for the defects listed:


(i) 10 percent for prunes which fail to meet the color requirement;


(ii) 10 percent for prunes which fail to meet the minimum diameter requirement;


(iii) 8 percent for prunes which fail to meet the remaining requirements of the grade: *Provided,* That not more than one-half of this amount, or 4 percent, shall be allowed for defects causing serious damage, including in the latter amount not more than one-half of 1 percent for decay.


(4) For defects of Italian type prunes en route or at destination. Not more than a total of 18 percent of the fruit in any lot may fail to meet the requirements of the specified grade: *Provided,* That included in this amount not more than the following percentages shall be allowed for the defects listed:


(i) 12 percent for permanent defects including therein not more than 10 percent which fail to meet the color requirement, 10 percent which fail to meet the minimum diameter requirement, and 8 percent which fail to meet the requirements of the grade because of other permanent defects;


(ii) 6 percent for defects causing serious damage, including therein not more than 4 percent for serious damage by permanent defects and not more than 2 percent for decay.


(b) *U.S. Combination and U.S. No. 2*—(1) *For defects at shipping point.*1 8 percent for fruit which fails to meet the requirements of the specified grade: *Provided,* That included in this amount not more than 4 percent shall be allowed for sunscald, decay or serious damage by insects or heat injury, including in this latter amount not more than one-half of 1 percent for decay.


(2) *For defects en route or at destination.* 12 percent for fruit which fails to meet the requirements of the specified grade: *Provided,* That included in this amount not more than the following percentages shall be allowed for defects listed:


(i) 8 percent for permanent defects including therein not more than 4 percent for sunscald, or serious damage by insects or heat injury; and,


(ii) 2 percent for decay. 


(3) When applying the tolerance for the U.S. Combination grade individual packages may have not more than 10 percent less than the percentage of U.S. No. 1 required: *Provided,* That the entire lot averages within the required percentage. (*See* § 51.1526.)
