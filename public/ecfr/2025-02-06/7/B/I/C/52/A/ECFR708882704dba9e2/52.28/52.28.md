# ยง 52.28   Appeal inspection certificate.

After an appeal inspection has been completed, the lot(s) cannot be further appealed unless authorized by the Administrator. An appeal inspection certificate shall be issued, showing the results of such appeal inspection; and such certificate shall supersede the inspection certificate previously issued for the processed product involved. Each appeal inspection certificate shall clearly identify the number and date of the inspection certificate which it supersedes. The superseded certificate shall become null and void upon the issuance of the appeal inspection certificate and shall no longer represent the quality or condition of the processed product described therein. The inspector or inspectors issuing an appeal inspection certificate shall forward notice of such issuance to such persons as he considers necessary to prevent misuse of the superseded certificate if the original and all copies of such superseded certificate have not previously been delivered to the inspector or inspectors issuing the appeal inspection certificate. The provisions in the regulations in this part concerning forms and certificates, issuance of certificates, and disposition of certificates shall apply to appeal inspection certificates, except that copies of such appeal inspection certificates shall be furnished to all interested parties who received copies of the superseded certificate.
