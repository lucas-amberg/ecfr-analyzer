# ยง 52.31   Inspectors.

Inspections will ordinarily be performed by employees under the Administrator who are employed as Federal Government employees for that purpose. However, any person employed under any joint Federal-State inspection service arrangement may be licensed, if otherwise qualified, by the Secretary to make inspections in accordance with this part on such processed products as may be specified in his license. Such license shall be issued only in a case where the Administrator is satisfied that the particular person is qualified to perform adequately the inspection service for which such person is to be licensed. Each such license shall bear the printed signature of the Secretary and shall be countersigned by an authorized employee of the Department. An inspector shall perform his duties pursuant to the regulations in this part as directed by the Administrator.
