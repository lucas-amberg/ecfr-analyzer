# § 52.1009   Character.

(a) *(A) classification.* Whole or pitted dates that possess a good character may be given a score of 36 to 40 points. “Good character” means that not less than 75 percent, by weight, of the dates are well developed, well fleshed, and soft, or at the time of packing are in a state of ripeness that within 15 days will develop into such character; and the remainder may possess a reasonably good character including not more than a total of 2 percent, by weight, of the dates that may possess semi-dry calyx ends and none may possess dry calyx ends.


(b) *(B) classification.* If the whole or pitted dates or whole dry dates for processing possess a reasonably good character, a score of 32 to 35 points may be given. Dates that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade B or U.S. Choice or U.S. Grade B (Dry) or U.S. Choice (Dry), whichever is applicable, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule).


(1) “Reasonably good character” with respect to whole or pitted dates other than whole dry dates for processing means that the dates are pliable; that not less than 75 percent, by weight, of the dates are reasonably well developed and reasonably well fleshed, or at time of packing are in a state of ripeness that within 15 days will develop into such character and the remainder may possess a fairly good character including not more than 10 percent, by weight, of the dates that may possess semi-dry calyx ends and dry calyx ends: *Provided,* That not more than 2 percent, by weight, of the dates may possess dry calyx ends.


(2) “Reasonably good character” with respect to whole dry dates for processing means that the dates may be firm and dry; that not less than 75 percent, by weight, of the dates are reasonably well developed and reasonably well fleshed and that the remainder are fairly well developed and fairly well fleshed.


(c) *(C) classification.* If the whole or pitted dates, whole dry dates for processing, date pieces, or macerated dates possess a fairly good character, a score of 28 to 31 points may be given. Dates that fall into this classification shall not be graded above U.S. Grade C or U.S. Standard or U.S. Grade C (Dry) or U.S. Standard (Dry), whichever is applicable, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule). “Fairly good character” has the following meanings with respect to the following styles:


(1) *Whole; pitted.* (i) In whole or pitted dates other than whole dry dates for processing the dates may be firm but are pliable; may possess semi-dry calyx ends; and not less than 80 percent, by weight, of the dates are fairly well developed and are fairly well fleshed, or at time of packing are in a state of ripeness that within 15 days will develop into such character and the remainder may fail to possess such fairly good character or may possess dry calyx ends.


(ii) In whole dry dates for processing the dates may be firm and dry but are fairly well developed and fairly well fleshed.


(2) *Pieces; macerated.* The character may be variable throughout the units or mass but not seriously affected by dry calyx end material or inedible portions of dates.


(d) *(SStd) classification.* Dates that fail to meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section may be given a score of 0 to 27 points and shall not be graded above Substandard, regardless of the total score for the product (this is a limiting rule).
