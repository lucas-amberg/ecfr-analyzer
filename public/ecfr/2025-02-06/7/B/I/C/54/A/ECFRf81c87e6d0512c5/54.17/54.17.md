When yield graded, bull and bullock carcasses will be identified with the class designation “Bull” and “Bullock,” respectively. The identification letters assigned to the grader performing the service will appear underneath and outside of the shield.


(d) For combined quality and yield grade identification purposes only, a shield enclosing the letters “US” on one side and “DA” on the other, with the appropriate yield grade designation number “1,” “2,” “3,” “4,” or “5,” and with the appropriate quality grade designation of “Prime,” “Choice,” “Select,” “Good,” “Standard,” “Commercial,” “Utility,” “Cutter,” “Canner,” or “Cull,” as shown in Figure 4 to paragraph (d) of this section, constitutes a form of official identification under the regulations to show the quality and yield grade under said standards. The identification letters assigned to the grader performing the service will appear underneath and outside of the shield.


(e) Under the regulations, for yield grade identification purposes only, a shield enclosing the letters “US” on one side and “DA” on the other, and with the appropriate yield grade designation number “1,” “2,” “3,” “4,” or “5,” as shown in Figure 5 to paragraph (e) of this section, constitutes a form of official identification under the regulations to show the yield grade under said standards. The identification letters assigned to the grader performing the service will appear underneath and outside of the shield.

(j) Figure 11 to paragraph (j) of this section, constitutes official identification to show that products produced under USDA AMS supervision that meet specified requirements may carry the “USDA Certified” statement and/or “USDA Certified” shield, so long as each is used in direct association with a clear description of the standard or other requirement(s) to which the product claims to be certified.


(1) The “USDA Certified” shield must replicate the form and design of the example in Figure 11 and must be printed legibly and conspicuously:

(k) Figure 12 to paragraph (k) of this section, constitutes official identification to show product or services produced under an approved USDA Further Processing Certification Program (FPCP):


(1) Products produced under an approved USDA FPCP may use the “USDA Further Processing Certification Program” statement and the “USDA Further Processing Certification Program” shield; and


(2) The USDA Further Processing Certification Program shield must replicate the form and design of the example in Figure 12 to paragraph (k) of this section and must be printed legibly and conspicuously:


(i) On a white background, with the term “USDA” in white overlaying a blue upper third of the shield and the terms “USDA Further Processing Certification Program” in black overlaying a white middle third of the shield, with no terms in the red lower third of the shield; or


(ii) On a white or transparent background with a black trimmed shield, with the term “USDA” in white overlaying a black upper third of the shield and the terms “USDA Further Processing Certification Program” in black overlaying the white or transparent remaining two-thirds of the shield.
