# § 57.905   Importation of restricted eggs or eggs containing more restricted eggs than permitted in the official standards for U.S. Consumer Grade B.

(a) No containers of restricted egg(s) other than checks or dirties shall be imported into the United States. The shipping containers of such eggs shall be identified with the name, address, and country of origin of the exporter, and the date of pack and quality of the eggs (e.g., checks, or dirties) preceded by the word “Imported” or the statement “Imported Restricted Eggs—For Processing Only In An Official USDA Processing Plant,” or “Restricted Eggs—Not To Be Used As Human Food.” Such identification shall be legible and conspicuous. Alternatively, for properly sealed and certified shipments of shell eggs imported for breaking at an official egg products processing plant, the shipping containers need not be labeled, provided that the shipment is segregated and controlled upon arrival at the destination breaking plant. 


(b) Eggs which are imported for use as human food and upon entry are found to contain more restricted eggs than permitted in the official standards for U.S. Consumer Grade B, shall be refused entry and returned to the importing country or be conspicuously and legibly identified as “Imported Restricted Eggs” and be sent directly under official seal: (1) To a place where they may be regraded to comply with the official U.S. standards for consumer grades; (2) to an official USDA egg products processing plant; or (3) to be used as other than human food.
