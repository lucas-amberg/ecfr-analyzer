An inspection or grading certificate shall be issued to cover a product inspected or graded in accordance with Instructions issued by the Administrator and shall be signed by an inspector or grader.

The signature of the holder of the power shall appear in conjunction with the name of the grader or inspector who personally graded or inspected the product.
