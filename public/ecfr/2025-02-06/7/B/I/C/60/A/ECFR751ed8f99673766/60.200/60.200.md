(e) *Labeling Covered Commodities of United States Origin.* A covered commodity may only bear the declaration of “Product of the U.S.” at retail if it meets the definition of United States Country of Origin as defined in § 60.128.


(f) *Labeling Imported Products That Have Not Undergone Substantial Transformation in the United States.* An imported covered commodity shall retain its origin as declared to U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the time the product entered the United States, through retail sale, provided that it has not undergone a substantial transformation (as established by U.S. Customs and Border Protection) in the United States.
