# ยง 61.37   License may be suspended.

The Director may, without a hearing, suspend or revoke the license issued to a licensed sampler upon written request and a satisfactory statement of reasons therefor submitted by such licensed sampler. Pending final action by the Secretary, the Director may, whenever he deems such action necessary, suspend the license of any licensed sampler by giving notice of such suspension to the licensee, accompanied by a statement of the reasons therefor. Within 10 days after the receipt of the aforesaid notice and statement of reasons by such licensee, he may file an appeal, in writing, with the Secretary, supported by any argument or evidence that he may wish to offer as to why his license should not be suspended or revoked. After the expiration of the aforesaid 10-day period and consideration of such argument and evidence, the Secretary will take such action as he deems appropriate with respect to such suspension or revocation. When no appeal is filed within the prescribed 10 days, the license shall be automatically revoked.
