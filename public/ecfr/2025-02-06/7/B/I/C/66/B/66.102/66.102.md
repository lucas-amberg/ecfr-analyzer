# § 66.102   Text disclosure.

A text disclosure must bear the text as described in this section. A text disclosure may use a plural form if applicable, e.g. if a food product includes more than one bioengineered food, then “bioengineered foods” or “bioengineered food ingredients” may be used.


(a) *Bioengineered foods.* If a food (including any ingredient produced from such food) is on the List of Bioengineered Foods, and records maintained by a regulated entity demonstrate that the food is bioengineered, the text disclosure must be one of the following, as applicable:


(1) “Bioengineered food” for bioengineered food that is a raw agricultural commodity or processed food that contains only bioengineered food ingredients; or


(2) “Contains a bioengineered food ingredient” for multi-ingredient food that is not described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section but contains one or more bioengineered food ingredients.


(b) *Predominant language in U.S.* Food subject to disclosure that is distributed solely in a U.S. territory may be labeled with statements equivalent to those required in this part, using the predominant language used in that territory.
