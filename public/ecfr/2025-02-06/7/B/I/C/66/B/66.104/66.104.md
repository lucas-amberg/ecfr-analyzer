# § 66.104   Symbol disclosure.

A symbol disclosure must replicate the form and design of Figure 1 to this section.


(a) The symbol is a circle with a green circumference, and a white outer band. The bottom portion of the circle contains an arch, filled in green to the bottom of the circle.

On the left side of the arch is a stem arching towards the center of the circle, ending in a four-pointed starburst.

In the background of the leaves, at the top of the circle and to the left of center, is approximately one-half of a circle filled in yellow. The remainder of the circle is filled in light blue. The symbol must contain the words “BIOENGINEERED.”

(c) The symbol may be printed in black and white.


(d) Nothing can be added to or removed from the bioengineered food symbol design except as allowed in this part.
