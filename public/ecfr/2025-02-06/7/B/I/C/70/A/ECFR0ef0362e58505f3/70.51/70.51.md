# § 70.51   Form of grademark and information required.

(a) *Form of official identification symbol and grademark.* (1) The shield set forth in Figure 1 of this section shall be the official identification symbol for purposes of this part and when used, imitated, or simulated in any manner in connection with poultry or rabbits, shall be deemed prima facia to constitute a representation that the product has been officially graded for the purposes of § 70.2.


(2) Except as otherwise authorized, the grademark permitted to be used to officially identify USDA consumer-graded poultry and rabbit products shall be of the form and design indicated in Figures 2 through 4 of this section. The shield shall be of sufficient size so that the printing and other information contained therein is legible and in approximately the same proportion as shown in these figures.


(3) The “Prepared From” grademark in Figure 5 of this section may be used to identify specialized poultry products for which there are no official U.S. grade standards, provided that these products are approved by the Agency and are prepared from U.S. Consumer Grade A poultry carcasses, parts, or other products that comply with the requirements of AMS § 70.220. All poultry products shall be processed and labeled in accordance with 9 CFR part 381.


(b) *Information required on grademark.* (1) Except as otherwise authorized by the Administrator, each grademark used shall include the letters “USDA” and the U.S. grade of the product it identifies, such as “A Grade,” as shown in Figure 2 of this section. Such information shall be printed with the shield and the wording within the shield in contrasting colors in a manner such that the design is legible and conspicuous on the material upon which it is printed.


(2) Except as otherwise authorized, the bands of the shield in Figure 4 of this section shall be displayed in three colors, with the color of the top, middle, and bottom bands being blue, white, and red, respectively.


(3) The “Prepared From” grademark in Figure 5 of this section may be any one of the designs shown in Figures 2 through 4 of this section. The text outside the shield shall be conspicuous, legible, and in approximately the same proportion and close proximity to the shield as shown in Figure 5 of this section.


(c) *Products that may be individually grademarked.* The grademarks set forth in Figures 2 through 4 of this section may be applied individually to ready-to-cook poultry, rabbits, and specified poultry food products for which consumer grades are provided in the U.S. Classes, Standards, and Grades for Poultry and Rabbits, AMS 70.200 and 70.300 *et seq.,* respectively, or to the containers in which such products are enclosed for the purpose of display and sale to household consumers, only when such products qualify for the particular grade indicated in accordance with the consumer grades.
