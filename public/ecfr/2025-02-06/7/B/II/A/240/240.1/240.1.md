# § 240.1   General purpose and scope.

(a) Each school year the Department programs agricultural commodities and other foods to States for delivery to program and commodity schools, nonresidential child care institutions, and service institutions pursuant to the regulations governing the donation of foods for use in the United States, its territories and possessions and areas under its jurisdiction (7 CFR part 250).


(b) Section 6(b) of the Act requires that not later than June 1 of each school year, the Secretary shall make an estimate of the value of the agricultural commodities and other foods that will be delivered during that school year for use in lunch programs by schools participating in the National School Lunch Program (7 CFR part 210). If this estimate is less than the total level of assistance authorized under section 6(e) of the Act the Secretary shall pay to the State administering agency not later than July 1 of that school year, an amount of funds equal to the difference between the value of donated foods as then programmed for that school year and the total level of assistance authorized under such section.


(c) Section 6(e)(1) of the Act requires:


(1) That for each school year, the total commodity assistance, or cash in lieu thereof, available to each State for the National School Lunch Program shall be the amount obtained by multiplying the national average value of donated foods, described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, by the number of lunches served in that State in the preceding school year; and


(2) That the national average value of foods donated to schools participating in the National School Lunch Program, or cash payments made in lieu thereof, shall be 11 cents, adjusted on July 1, 1982, and each July 1 thereafter to reflect changes in the Price Index for Food Used in Schools and Institutions. Section 6(e)(1) further requires that not less than 75 percent of the assistance under that section shall be in the form of donated foods for the National School Lunch Program. After the end of each school year, FNS shall reconcile the number of lunches served by schools in each State with the number served in the preceding school year and, based on such reconciliation, shall increase or reduce subsequent commodity assistance or cash in lieu thereof provided to each State.


(d) Section 12(g) of the Act provides that whoever embezzles, willfully misapplies, steals, or obtains by fraud any funds, assets, or property that are the subject of a grant or other form of assistance under this Act or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, whether received directly or indirectly from the United States Department of Agriculture, or whoever receives, conceals, or retains such funds, assets, or property to his use or gain, knowing such funds, assets, or property have been embezzled, willfully misapplied, stolen, or obtained by fraud shall, if such funds, assets, or property are of the value of $100 or more, be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both, or, if such funds, assets, or property are of a value of less than $100, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.


(e) Section 14(f) of the Act provides that the value of foods donated to States for use in commodity schools for any school year shall be the sum of the national average value of donated foods established under section 6(e) of the Act and the national average payment established under section 4 of the Act. Section 14(f) also provides that such schools shall be eligible to receive up to five cents of such value in cash for processing and handling expenses related to the use of the donated foods.


(f) Sections 17(h)(1) (B) and (C) of the Act provide that the value of commodities, or cash in lieu thereof, donated to States for use in nonresidential child or adult care institutions participating in the Child and Adult Care Food Program (7 CFR part 226) for any school year shall be, at a minimum, the amount obtained by multiplying the number of lunches and suppers served during the preceding school year by the rate established for lunches for that school year under section 6(e) of the Act. At the end of each school year, FNS shall reconcile the number of lunches and suppers served in participating institutions in each State during such school year with the number of lunches and suppers served in the preceding school year and, based on such reconciliation, shall increase or reduce subsequent commodity assistance or cash in lieu of commodities provided to each State.


(g) Section 16 of the Act provides that a State which has phased out its food distribution facilities prior to June 30, 1974, may elect to receive cash payments in lieu of donated foods for the purposes of the applicable child nutrition programs—i.e., the National School Lunch Program, the Summer Food Service Program for Children (7 CFR part 225) and the Child Care Food Program.


(h) These regulations prescribe the methods for determination of the amount of payments, the manner of disbursement and the requirements for accountability for funds when these respective statutory authorities require the Department to make cash payments in lieu of donating agricultural commodities and other foods.
