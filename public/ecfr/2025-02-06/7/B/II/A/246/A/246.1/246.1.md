# ยง 246.1   General purpose and scope.

This part announces regulations under which the Secretary of Agriculture shall carry out the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC Program). Section 17 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, as amended, states in part that the Congress finds that substantial numbers of pregnant, postpartum and breastfeeding women, infants and young children from families with inadequate income are at special risk with respect to their physical and mental health by reason of inadequate nutrition or health care, or both. The purpose of the Program is to provide supplemental foods and nutrition education, including breastfeeding promotion and support, through payment of cash grants to State agencies which administer the Program through local agencies at no cost to eligible persons. The Program shall serve as an adjunct to good health care during critical times of growth and development, in order to prevent the occurrence of health problems, including drug and other harmful substance abuse, and to improve the health status of these persons. The program shall be supplementary to SNAP; any program under which foods are distributed to needy families in lieu of SNAP benefits; and receipt of food or meals from soup kitchens, or shelters, or other forms of emergency food assistance.
