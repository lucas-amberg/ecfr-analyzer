(c) *Record of expenditures.* The State agency shall maintain records which adequately identify the source and use of funds expended for Program activities. These records shall contain, but are not limited to, information pertaining to authorization, receipt of funds, obligations, unobligated balances, assets, liabilities, outlays, and income.


(d) *Payment of costs.* The State shall implement procedures which ensure prompt and accurate payment of allowable costs, and ensure the allowability and allocability of costs in accordance with the cost principles and standard provisions of this part, 2 CFR part 200, subpart D, USDA implementing regulations 2 CFR part 400 and part 415, and FNS guidelines and instructions.
