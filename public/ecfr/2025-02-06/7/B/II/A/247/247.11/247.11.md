# ยง 247.11   Applicants exceed caseload levels.

(a) *What must the local agency do if the number of applicants exceeds the local agency's caseload level?* If all caseload has been filled, the local agency must maintain a waiting list of individuals who apply for the program. In establishing the waiting list, the local agency must include the date of application and information necessary to allow the local agency to contact the applicant when caseload space becomes available. Unless they have been determined ineligible, applicants must be notified of their placement on a waiting list within 10 days of their request for benefits in accordance with ยง 247.15.


(b) *What are the requirements for serving individuals on the waiting list once caseload slots become available?* The local agency must certify eligible individuals from the waiting list consistent with civil rights requirements at ยง 247.37. For example, a local agency may certify eligible individuals from the waiting list based on the date the application was received on a first-come, first-served basis.
