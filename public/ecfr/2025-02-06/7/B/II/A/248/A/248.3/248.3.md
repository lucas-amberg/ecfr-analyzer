# ยง 248.3   Administration.

(a) *Delegation to FNS.* Within the Department, FNS shall act on behalf of the Department in the administration of the FMNP. Within FNS, SFPD and the FNS Regional Offices are responsible for FMNP administration. FNS shall provide assistance to State agencies and evaluate all levels of FMNP operations to ensure that the goals of the FMNP are achieved in the most effective and efficient manner possible.


(b) *Delegation to State agency.* The State agency is responsible for the effective and efficient administration of the FMNP in accordance with the requirements of this part; the requirements of the Department's regulations governing nondiscrimination (7 CFR parts 15, 15a and 15b), administration of grants (2 CFR part 200, subparts A, B, D, E and F and USDA implementing regulations 2 CFR part 400 and part 415), nonprocurement debarment/suspension (2 CFR part 180, OMB Guidelines to Agencies on Government-wide Debarment and Suspension and USDA implementing regulations 2 CFR part 417), drug-free workplace (2 CFR part 182, Government-wide Requirements for Drug-Free Workplace), and lobbying (2 CFR part 200, subpart E and USDA implementing regulations 2 CFR part 400, part 415 and part 418); and, Office of Management and Budget Circular A-130, FNS guidelines, and Instructions issued under the FNS Directives Management System. The State agency shall provide guidance to cooperating WIC State and local agencies on all aspects of FMNP operations. Pursuant to section 17(m)(2) of the CNA, State agencies may operate the FMNP locally through nonprofit organizations or local government entities and must ensure coordination among the appropriate agencies and organizations.


(c) *Agreement and State Plan.* (1) Each State agency desiring to administer the FMNP shall annually submit a State Plan and enter into a written agreement with the Department for administration of the Program in the jurisdiction of the State agency in accordance with the provisions of this part.


(2) The written agreement must include a statement that supports full use of Federal funds provided to State agencies for the administration of the FMNP, and excludes such funds from State budget restrictions or limitations, including hiring freezes, work furloughs, and travel restrictions.


(d) *State agency ineligibility.* A State agency shall be ineligible to participate in the FMNP if State or local sales tax is collected on Program food purchases in the area in which it administers the Program, except that, if sales tax is collected on Program food purchases by sovereign Indian entities which are not State agencies, the State agency shall remain eligible so long as any farmers' markets collecting such tax are disqualified.


(e) *Coordination with WIC agency.* The Chief Executive Officer of the State shall ensure coordination between the designated administering State agency and the WIC State agency, if different, by ensuring that the two agencies enter into a written agreement. Such coordination between agencies is necessary for the successful operation of the FMNP, because WIC participants or persons on the waiting list for WIC services are the only persons eligible to receive Federal benefits under the FMNP. The written agreement shall delineate the responsibilities of each agency, describe any compensation for services, and shall be signed by the designated representative of each agency. This agreement shall be submitted each year along with the State Plan.


(f) *State staffing standards.* Each State agency shall ensure that sufficient staff is available to efficiently and effectively administer the FMNP. This shall include, but not be limited to, sufficient staff to provide nutrition education in coordination with the WIC Program, coupon and market management, fiscal reporting, monitoring, and training. The State agency shall provide an outline of administrative staff and job descriptions for staff whose salaries will be paid from program funds in their State Plans.
