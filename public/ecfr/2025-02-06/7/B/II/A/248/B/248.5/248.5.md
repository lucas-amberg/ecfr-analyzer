# ยง 248.5   Selection of new State agencies.

In selecting new State agencies, the Department will use objective criteria to rank and approve State plans submitted in accordance with ยง 248.4. In making this ranking, the Department will consider the amount of funds necessary to successfully operate the FMNP in the State compared with other States and with the total amount of funds available to the FMNP. Approval of a State Plan does not equate to an obligation on the part of the Department to fund the FMNP within that State agency.
