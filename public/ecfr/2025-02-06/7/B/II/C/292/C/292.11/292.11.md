# § 292.11   Advance Planning Document (APD) processes.

(a) *APD process for State agencies and ITOs.* As a condition for the initial and continued ability to claim Federal financial participation (FFP) for the costs of the planning, development, acquisition, installation, and implementation of Information System (IS) equipment and services used in the administration of the Summer EBT Program, Summer EBT agencies must adhere to the APD process in this section (see guidance in Food and Nutrition Service's (FNS' Handbook 901 for more information), the State Systems APD process in paragraph (b) of this section, and for SNAP and WIC ITOs the existing APD process requirements for Management Information Systems and/or Information Systems as outlined in 7 CFR parts 246, 274, and 277, respectively. Summer EBT Projects have the option to include the Summer EBT Program in an existing SNAP or WIC EBT APD or to create a separate APD specific to Summer EBT services. Where the Summer EBT agency is a SNAP or WIC agency, changes to the Management Information System to support Summer EBT follow the APD processes as outlined in §§ 246.12 and 277.18 of this chapter (see guidance within FNS' Handbook 901 for more information). Child Nutrition Programs do not have a similar requirement for Management Information Systems, so the APD requirements will only apply the EBT services projects associated with the Summer EBT Program.


(b) *APD process for States.* Requirements for FNS prior approval of IS projects—


(1) *For the acquisition of IS equipment or services to be utilized in an EBT system regardless of the cost of the acquisition in accordance with the Summer EBT issuance standards (subpart D of this part).* For Summer EBT agencies that administer SNAP and are planning changes to their SNAP information systems to incorporate the Summer EBT requirements, refer to § 277.18 of this chapter.


(2) *Specific prior approval requirements.* (i) For IS projects which require prior approval, as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the State Summer EBT agency must obtain the prior written approval of USDA for:


(A) Conducting planning activities, entering into contractual agreements or making any other commitment for acquiring the necessary planning services for the development of an initial Summer EBT services project; and


(B) Conducting design, development, testing or implementation activities, entering into contractual agreements or making any other commitment for the acquisition of IS equipment or services.


(ii) For IS equipment and services acquisitions requiring prior approval as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, prior approval of the following documents associated with such acquisitions is also required:


(A) *Requests for Proposals (RFPs).* Unless specifically exempted by FNS, the State Summer EBT agency must obtain prior written approval of the RFP before the RFP may be released. The State Summer EBT agency must obtain prior written approval from FNS for RFPs which are associated with an EBT system regardless of the cost.


(B) *Contracts.* All contracts must be submitted to FNS. The State Summer EBT agency must obtain prior written approval from FNS for contracts which are associated with an EBT system regardless of the cost.


(C) *Contract amendments.* All contract amendments must be submitted to FNS. Unless specifically exempted by FNS, the State Summer EBT agency must obtain prior written approval from FNS of any contract amendments which cumulatively exceed 20 percent of the base contract costs before being signed by the State Summer EBT agency.


(3) *Procurement requirements.* (i) Procurements of IS equipment and services are subject to § 277.14 of this chapter (procurement standards) regardless of any conditions for prior approval contained in this section, except the requirements of § 277.14(b)(1) and (2) of this chapter regarding review of proposed contracts. The procurement standards in § 277.14(b)(1) and (2) include a requirement for maximum practical open and free competition regardless of whether the procurement is formally advertised or negotiated.


(ii) The standards prescribed by § 277.14 of this chapter, as well as the requirement for prior approval in this paragraph (b), apply to IS services and equipment acquired primarily to support Summer EBT regardless of the acquiring entity.


(iii) The competitive procurement policy prescribed by § 277.14 of this chapter must be applicable except for IS services provided by the agency itself, or by other State or local agencies.


(iv) The following FNS-required provisions as required under 2 CFR part 200, appendix II, apply to Summer EBT procurements as well:


(A) Compliance with Executive Order 11246 related to equal employment opportunity.


(B) Compliance with Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q).


(C) Compliance with Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251-1387).


(D) Compliance with Anti-Lobbying Act.


(E) Compliance with Americans with Disabilities Act.


(F) Compliance with drug-free workplace requirements.


(G) Compliance with suspension/debarment requirements.


(H) USDA has royalty-free rights to use software and documentation developed.


(I) The State Summer EBT agency must obtain prior written approval from FNS, as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, to claim and receive reimbursement for the associated costs of the IS acquisition.


(4) *Document submission requirements.* (i) For IS projects requiring prior approval as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, the State Summer EBT agency must submit the following documents to FNS for approval:


(A) Planning APD as described in § 292.2.


(B) Implementation APD as described in § 292.2.


(C) Annual APDU as described in § 292.2 for the initial Summer EBT implementation.


(ii) The Annual APDU must be submitted to FNS 60 days prior to the expiration of the FFP approval, unless the submission date is specifically altered by USDA. In years where an As Needed APDU is required, as described in § 292.2, FNS may waive or modify the requirement to submit the annual APDU. The requirement in this paragraph (b)(4)(ii) will only apply to the initial implementation of Summer EBT.


(iii) As Needed APDU as described in § 292.2. As Needed APDU are required to obtain a commitment of FFP whenever significant project changes occur. Significant project changes are defined as changes in cost, schedule, scope or strategy which exceed FNS-defined thresholds or triggers. Without such approval, the Summer EBT agency is at risk for funding of project activities which are not in compliance with the terms and conditions of the approved APD and subsequently approved APDU until such time as approval is specifically granted by FNS.


(iv) Acquisition documents as described in § 277.14(g) of this chapter for Summer EBT agencies that administer SNAP (see guidance within in FNS Handbook 901 for more information), or for Summer EBT services projects utilizing an existing or new SNAP EBT services contract for Summer EBT.


(v) Emergency acquisition requests as described in paragraph (j) of this section.


(c) *Prior approval.* The State Summer EBT agency must obtain prior FNS approval of the documents specified in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section in order to claim and receive reimbursement for the associated costs of the IS acquisition.


(d) *Approval by the State Summer EBT agency.* Approval by the State Summer EBT agency is required for all documents and acquisitions specified in this subpart prior to submission for FNS approval. However, the State Summer EBT agency may delegate approval authority to any subordinate entity for those acquisitions of IS equipment and services not requiring prior approval by FNS.


(e) *Prompt action on requests for prior approval.* FNS will reply promptly to State Summer EBT agency requests for prior approval. If FNS has not provided written approval, disapproval, or a request for additional information within 60 days of FNS' acknowledgment of receipt of the State Summer EBT agency's request, the request will be deemed to have provisionally met the prior approval requirement in paragraph (b) of this section. However, provisional approval will not exempt a State Summer EBT agency from having to meet all other Federal requirements which pertain to the acquisition of IS equipment and services. Such requirements remain subject to Federal audit and review.


(f) *APD content requirements*—(1) *Planning APD (PAPD).* The PAPD is a written plan of action to acquire proposed services or equipment and to perform necessary activities to investigate the feasibility, system alternatives, requirements and resources needed to replace, modify, or upgrade the State Summer EBT agency's IS. The PAPD must contain adequate documentation to demonstrate the need to undertake a planning process, as well as a thorough description of the proposed planning activities, and estimated costs and timeline (see guidance within FNS' Handbook 901 for more information).


(2) *Implementation APD (IAPD).* The IAPD is a written plan of action to acquire the proposed IS services or equipment and to perform necessary activities to design, develop, acquire, install, test, and implement the new IS. The IAPD must contain detailed documentation of planning and preparedness for the proposed project, (see guidance within FNS' Handbook 901 for more information), demonstrating the feasibility of the project, thorough analysis of system requirements and design, a rigorous management approach, stewardship of Federal funds, a realistic schedule and budget, and preliminary plans for key project phases. The IAPD must be submitted and approved prior to incurring any costs under the new EBT service contract.


(3) *Annual APDU content requirements.* The Annual APDU is a yearly update to ongoing IS projects when planning or implementation activities occur. The Annual APDU must contain documentation on the project activity status and a description of major tasks, milestones, budget, and any changes (see guidance within FNS' Handbook 901 for more information).


(4) *As Needed APDU content requirements.*

The As Needed APDU document must contain the items as defined in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section with emphasis on the area(s) where changes have occurred or are anticipated that triggered the submission of the APDU (see guidance within FNS' Handbook 901 for more information).”


Paragraph (d) should read: (q) *APD process for ITOs.* For the acquisition of IS equipment or services to be utilized in an EBT system regardless of the cost of the acquisition in accordance with the Summer EBT issuance standards in subpart D to this part, WIC EBT coordinating Summer EBT agencies, administering WIC, that are planning changes to their ITO Management Information Systems to incorporate the Summer EBT requirements should refer to the APD process requirements outlined in 7 CFR 246.12, 2 CFR part 200, appendix XI, and the APD process in this section (see guidance within FNS' Handbook 901 for more information).


(g) *Service agreements.* (1) The State Summer EBT agency must execute service agreements when IS services are to be provided by a State central IT facility or another State or local agency. *Service agreement* means the document signed by the State or local agency and the State or local central IT facility whenever an IT facility provides IT services to the State or local agency. Service agreements must:


(i) Identify the IS services that will be provided;


(ii) Include a schedule of rates for each identified IS service, and a certification that these rates apply equally to all users;


(iii) Include a description of the method(s) of accounting for the services rendered under the agreement and computing services charges;


(iv) Include assurances that services provided will be timely and satisfactory;


(v) Include assurances that information in the IS as well as access, use and disposal of IS data will be safeguarded in accordance with provisions of §§ 272.1(c) (disclosure) and 277.13 (property) of this chapter;


(vi) Require the provider to obtain prior approval from FNS pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section for IS equipment and IS services that are acquired from commercial sources primarily to support federally aided public assistance programs and require the provider to comply with § 277.14 of this chapter (procurement standards) for procurements related to the service agreement. IS equipment and services are considered to be primarily acquired to support federally aided public assistance programs when the Programs may reasonably be expected to either be billed for more than 50 percent of the total charges made to all users of the IS equipment and services during the time period covered by the service agreement, or directly charged for the total cost of the purchase or lease of IS equipment or services;


(vii) Include the beginning and ending dates of the period of time covered by the service agreement; and


(viii) Include a schedule of expected total charges to the Program for the period of the service agreement.


(2) The State Summer EBT agency must maintain a copy of each service agreement in its files for Federal review upon request.


(h) *Basis for continued Federal financial participation (FFP)*—(1) General. FNS will continue FFP at the levels approved in the Planning APD and the Implementation APD provided that project development proceeds in accordance with the conditions and terms of the approved APD and that IS resources are used for the purposes authorized. FNS will use the APDU to monitor IS project development. The submission of the update as prescribed in paragraph (b)(4) of this section for the duration of project development is a condition for continued FFP. In addition, periodic onsite reviews of IS project development and State and local agency IS operations may be conducted by or for FNS to assure compliance with approved APDs, proper use of IS resources, and the adequacy of State or local agency IS operations.


(2) *Pre-implementation.* The State Summer EBT agency must demonstrate through thorough testing that the system meets all program functional and performance requirements. FNS may require a pre-implementation review of the system to validate system functionality prior to Summer EBT agency testing.


(3) *Testing.* The State Summer EBT agency must commit to completing and submitting the following documents for FNS approval and obtaining such approval prior to issuance of benefits to eligible households in the project area:


(i) *Functional demonstration.* A functional demonstration of the functional requirements prescribed in this part in combination with the system components described by the approved system design is recommended in order to identify and resolve any problems prior to acceptance testing. The Department reserves the right to participate in the functional demonstration if one is conducted. FNS may require that any or all of these tests be repeated in instances where significant modifications are made to the system after these tests are initially completed or if problems that surfaced during initial testing warrant a retest.


(ii) *An Acceptance Test Plan.* The Acceptance Test Plan for the project must describe the methodology to be utilized to verify that the EBT system complies with Program requirements and System Design specifications. At a minimum, the Acceptance Test Plan must address:


(A) The types of testing to be performed;


(B) The organization of the test team and associated responsibilities, test database generation, test case development, test schedule, and the documentation of test results. Acceptance testing must include functional requirements testing, error condition handling and destructive testing, security testing, recovery testing, controls testing, stress and throughput performance testing, and regression testing; and


(C) A “what-if” component must also be included to permit the opportunity for observers and participants to test possible scenarios in a free-form manner.


(iii) *Independent testing.* The Department reserves the right to participate and conduct independent testing as necessary during the acceptance testing and appropriate events during system design, development, implementation, and operation.


(iv) *An acceptance test report.* The State Summer EBT agency must provide a separate report after the completion of the acceptance test only in instances where FNS is not present at the testing or when serious problems are uncovered during the testing that remain unresolved by the end of the test session. The report must summarize the activities, describe any discrepancies, describe the proposed solutions to discrepancies, and the timetable for their retesting and completion. In addition, the report must contain the State Summer EBT agency's recommendations regarding implementation of the EBT system.


(v) *A prototype food retailer agreement.* The State Summer EBT agency must enter an agreement with each FNS authorized retailer that complies with the requirements under § 274.3 of this chapter.


(vi) *An implementation plan.* (A) The implementation plan must include the following:


(*1*) A description of the tools, procedures, detailed schedules, and resources needed to implement the project;


(*2*) The equipment acquisition and installation requirements, ordering schedules, and system and component testing;


(*3*) A phase-in-strategy which permits a measured and orderly transition from one EBT system to another. In describing this strategy, the plan must address schedules that avoid disruption of normal shopping patterns and operations of participating children and food retailers. Training of Summer EBT eligible children, State Summer EBT agency personnel and retailers and/or their trainers must be coordinated with the installation of equipment in retail stores;


(*4*) A description of on-going tasks associated with fine-tuning the system and making any corrective actions necessary to meet contractual requirements. The description must also address those tasks associated with ongoing training, document updates, equipment maintenance, on-site support and system adjustments, as needed to meet Program requirements; and,


(*5*) A plan for orderly phase-out of the project and/or for continuing benefit issuance operations if it is demonstrated during the pilot project or conversion operations that the new system is not acceptable.


(B) The State Summer EBT agency must submit a written contingency plan for FNS approval. The contingency plan must contain information regarding the back-up issuance system that will be activated in the event of an emergency shut-down which results in short-term or extended system inaccessibility, or total discontinuation of EBT system operations. The contingency plan must be incorporated into the Summer EBT State system security plan after FNS approval as specified in paragraph (p) of this section.


(i) *Disallowance of Federal financial participation (FFP).* If FNS finds that any acquisition approved under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section fails to comply with the criteria, requirements and other undertakings described in the approved or modified APD, payment of FFP may be suspended or may be disallowed in whole or in part.


(j) *Emergency acquisition requirements.* The State Summer EBT agency may request FFP for the costs of IS equipment and services acquired to meet emergency situations in which the agency can demonstrate to FNS an immediate need to acquire IS equipment or services in order to continue operation of Summer EBT; and the State Summer EBT agency can clearly document that the need could not have been anticipated or planned for and precludes the State from following the prior approval requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. FNS may provide FFP in emergency situations if the following conditions are met:


(1) The State Summer EBT agency must submit a written request to FNS prior to the acquisition of any IS equipment or services. The written request must include:


(i) A brief description of the IS equipment and/or services to be acquired and an estimate of their costs;


(ii) A brief description of the circumstances which result in the State Summer EBT agency's need to proceed with the acquisition prior to fulfilling approval requirements at paragraph (c) of this section; and


(iii) A description of the adverse impact which would result if the State Summer EBT agency does not immediately acquire the IS equipment and/or services.


(2) Upon receipt of a written request for emergency acquisition FNS must provide a written response to the State Summer EBT agency within 14 days. The FNS response must:


(i) Inform the State Summer EBT agency that the request has been disapproved and the reason for disapproval.


(ii) If FNS approves the request submitted under paragraph (j)(1) of this section, FFP will be available from the date the State Summer EBT agency acquires the IS equipment and services.


(iii) FNS recognizes that an emergency situation exists and grants conditional approval pending receipt of the State Summer EBT agency's formal submission of the IAPD information specified at paragraph (b)(4) of this section within 90 days from the date of the agency's initial written request.


(iv) If the complete IAPD submission required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section is not received by FNS within 90 days from the date of the initial written request, costs may be subject to disallowance.


(k) *General cost requirements*—(1) *Cost determination.* Actual costs must be determined in compliance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart E, and USDA implementing regulations in 2 CFR parts 400 and 415 and an FNS approved budget and must be reconcilable with the approved FNS funding level. A State Summer EBT agency must not claim reimbursement for costs charged to any other Federal program or uses of IS systems for purposes not connected with Summer EBT. The approved APD cost allocation plan includes the methods which will be used to identify and classify costs to be claimed. This methodology must be submitted to FNS as part of the request for FNS approval of funding as required in this section. Operational costs are to be allocated based on the statewide cost allocation plan rather than the APD cost plan. Approved cost allocation plans for ongoing operational costs must not apply to IS system development costs under this section unless documentation required under paragraph (b) of this section is submitted to and approvals are obtained from FNS. Any APD-related costs approved by FNS must be excluded in determining the Summer EBT agency's administrative costs under any other section of this part.


(2) *Cost identification for purposes of FFP claims.* State Summer EBT agencies must assign and claim the costs incurred under an approved APD in accordance with the following criteria:


(i) *Development costs.* Using its normal departmental accounting system, in accordance with the cost principles set forth in 2 CFR part 200, subpart E, and USDA implementing regulations in 2 CFR parts 400 and 415, the State Summer EBT agency must specifically identify what items of costs constitute development costs, assign these costs to specific project cost centers, and distribute these costs to funding sources based on the specific identification, assignment and distribution outlined in the approved APD. The methods for distributing costs set forth in the APD should provide for assigning identifiable costs, to the extent practicable, directly to program/functions. The State Summer EBT agency must amend the cost allocation plan required by 2 CFR part 200, subpart E, to include the approved APD methodology for the identification, assignment, and distribution of the development costs.


(ii) *Operational costs.* Costs incurred for the operation of an IS must be identified and assigned by the State Summer EBT agency to funding sources in accordance with the approved cost allocation plan required by 2 CFR part 200, subpart E.


(iii) *Service agreement costs.* States that operate a central data processing facility must use their approved central service cost allocation plan required by 2 CFR part 200, subpart E, and USDA implementing regulations in 2 CFR parts 400 and 415 to identify and assign costs incurred under service agreements with the State Summer EBT agency. The State Summer EBT agency must then distribute these costs to funding sources in accordance with the development and operational costs outlined in this section.


(iv) *Claiming costs.* Prior to claiming funding under this section the State Summer EBT agency must have complied with the requirements for obtaining approval and prior approval of paragraph (b) of this section.


(v) *Budget authority.* FNS approval of requests for funding must provide notification to the State Summer EBT agency of the budget authority and dollar limitations under which such funding may be claimed. FNS must provide this amount as a total authorization for such funding which may not be exceeded unless amended by FNS. FNS's determination of the amount of this authorization must be based on the budget submitted by the State Summer EBT agency. Activities not included in the approved budget, as well as continuation of approved activities beyond scheduled deadlines in the approved plan, must require FNS approval of an As Needed APDU as prescribed in paragraphs (b)(4) and (f)(4) of this section, including an amended State budget. Requests to amend the budget authorization approved by FNS must be submitted to FNS prior to claiming such expenses.


(l) *Access to the system and records.* Access to the system in all aspects, including but not limited to design, development, and operation, including work performed by any source, and including cost records of contractors and subcontractors, must be made available by the State Summer EBT agency to FNS or its authorized representatives at intervals as are deemed necessary by FNS, in order to determine whether the conditions for approval are being met and to determine the efficiency, economy and effectiveness of the system. Failure to provide full access to all parts of the system may result in suspension and/or termination of Summer EBT funds for the costs of the system and its operation.


(m) *Ownership rights.* The State Summer EBT agency must comply with the requirements under this part and the requirement for intangible property in 2 CFR 200.315.


(n) *Software.* (1) The State or local government must include a clause in all procurement instruments which provides that the State or local government must have all ownership rights in any software or modifications thereof and associated documentation designed, developed, or installed with FFP under this section.


(2) FNS reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use and to authorize others to use for Federal Government purposes, such software, modifications, and documentation.


(3) Proprietary operating/vendor software packages which meet the definition of COTS in § 292.2 must not be subject to the ownership provisions in paragraph (m) of this section. FFP is not available for development costs for proprietary application software developed specifically for Summer EBT.
