(A) For children who can be streamline certified or who have an approved Summer EBT application on file, benefits must be issued and available for participants to use at least seven calendar days and not more than 14 calendar days before the start of the summer operational period. When the Summer EBT agency does not have sufficient data to issue a benefit to an eligible child, the agency must work to resolve the case and issue the benefit as expeditiously as possible.

Regardless of the issuance schedule, Summer EBT agencies may only issue a full three months of benefits for the summer operational period.


(iv) Children on applications that are selected for verification must not be issued benefits until verification is complete and eligibility is confirmed. Additional information about the verification requirements for Summer EBT applications can be found at § 292.14.

(2) *Method of issuance.* Benefits may be issued:


(i) In the form of an EBT card;


(A) Into an existing EBT account associated with an existing EBT card; or


(B) Into a new EBT account associated with a new EBT card;

(e) *Benefit amount.* (1) In 2024, the benefit will be $40 per month in the summer operational period for each eligible child, and will be adjusted in subsequent years to reflect changes in the cost of food as measured by the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP). Any year-to-year decrease of the TFP will not be implemented.


(2) In Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands of the United States, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Secretary may establish appropriate adjustments for each such State to the national average payment rates to reflect the differences between the costs of foods in those States and the costs of foods in all other States.


(3) Benefit amounts will be issued in an amount equal to the unrounded benefit amount from the prior year, adjusted to the nearest lower dollar increment to reflect changes to the cost of the diet described in section 3(u) of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 2012(u)) for the 12-month period ending on November 30 of the preceding calendar year and rounded to the nearest lower dollar increment. Rates will be effective January 1 through December 31 of each year.

(2) In providing benefit allotments Summer EBT agencies:


(i) May stagger issuance throughout the month.


(ii) Must establish an availability date for household access to their benefits and inform households of this date.

(3) *Adjustments.* The Summer EBT agency:


(i) May make adjustments to benefits posted to household accounts after the posting process is complete but prior to the availability date for household access in the event benefits are erroneously posted.


(ii) Must make adjustments to an account to correct an auditable, out-of-balance settlement condition that occurs during the redemption process as a result of a system error.

(ii) An immediate hold must be placed on accounts at the time notice is received from a household regarding the need for card or PIN replacement. The Summer EBT agency must implement a reporting system which is continually operative. Once a household reports their EBT card has been lost or stolen, the agency must assume liability for benefits subsequently drawn from the account and replace any lost or stolen benefits to the household. The Summer EBT agency must maintain a record showing the date and time of all reports by households that their card is lost or stolen.
