# ยง 301.1-2   Criteria for special need requests.

(a) A special need request, as described in ยง 301.1, may be generated by a State or a political subdivision of a State. If the request is generated by a political subdivision of a State, the request must be submitted to APHIS through the State. States may also collaborate with other States to submit multi-State special need requests. However, if submitted, the multi-State special need request must include information in sufficient detail to allow APHIS to analyze the impacts on each State on an individual basis. All special need requests must be signed by the executive official or officials or by a plant protection official or officials of the State(s) making the request and must contain the following:


(1) Data drawn from a scientifically sound detection survey, showing that the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest of concern does not exist in the State or political subdivision or, if already present in the State or political subdivision, the distribution of the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest of concern;


(2) If the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest is not present in the State or political subdivision, a risk analysis or other scientific data showing that the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest could enter the State or political subdivision and become established;


(3) Specific information showing that, if introduced into or allowed to spread within the State or political subdivision, the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest would harm or injure the environment or agricultural resources in the State or political subdivision. The request should contain detailed information, including quantitative estimates, if available, about what harm or injury would result from the introduction or dissemination of the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest in the State or political subdivision;


(4) Specific information showing that the State or political subdivision has characteristics that make it particularly vulnerable to the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest, such as unique plants, diversity of flora, historical concerns, or any other special basis for the request for additional restrictions or prohibitions; and


(5) Information detailing the proposed additional prohibitions or restrictions and scientific data demonstrating that the proposed additional prohibitions or restrictions are necessary and adequate, and that there is no less drastic action that is feasible and that would be adequate, to prevent the introduction or spread of the biological control organism, noxious weed, or plant pest in the State or political subdivision.


(b) All special need requests must be submitted to the Deputy Administrator for Plant Protection and Quarantine, APHIS, USDA, Jamie L. Whitten Federal Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue, SW., Room 301-E, Washington, DC 20250.
