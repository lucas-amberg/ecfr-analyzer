# ยง 301.52-2   Authorization for the Deputy Administrator to list regulated areas and suppressive or generally infested areas.

(a) The Deputy Administrator will list as a regulated area each State or portion of a State in which evidence of a reproducing population of pink bollworm is present, or in which there is reason to believe that pink bollworm is present, or which it is deemed necessary to regulate because of their proximity to infestation or their inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from infested localities. The Deputy Administrator may divide any regulated area into a suppressive area and a generally infested area in accordance with the definitions of these terms in ยง 301.52-1. The Deputy Administrator will publish a list of all regulated areas, including the suppressive and generally infested areas therein, at *www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/cotton-pests/cotton-pests.* The list will include the date that the list was last updated. Lists of all regulated areas, including the suppressive and generally infested areas therein, may also be obtained by request from any local office of PPQ; local offices are listed in telephone directories and on the internet at *www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/ppq-program-overview/sphd.* After a change is made to the list of regulated areas, APHIS will publish a notice in the _Federal Register_ informing the public that the change has occurred and describing the change to the regulated areas. Less than an entire State will be designated as a regulated area only if the Deputy Administrator determines that:


(1) The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the intrastate movement of regulated articles that are equivalent to those imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of regulated articles; and


(2) The designation of less than an entire State as a regulated area will be adequate to prevent the artificial interstate spread of pink bollworm.


(b) [Reserved]
