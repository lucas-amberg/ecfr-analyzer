(b) Limited permits may be issued by an inspector to allow interstate movement of regulated articles, not eligible for certification under this subpart, to specified destinations for limited handling, utilization, or processing, or for treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter, when upon evaluation of the circumstances involved in each specific case the inspector determines that such movement will not result in the spread of the pink bollworm and requirements of other applicable Federal domestic plant quarantines have been met. 


(c) Restricted destination permits may be issued by an inspector to allow the interstate movement of regulated articles to any destination permitted under all applicable Federal domestic plant quarantines (for other than scientific purposes) if such articles are not eligible for certification under all such quarantines but would otherwise qualify for certification under this subpart.

(e) Certificate, limited permit, and restricted destination permit forms may be issued by an inspector to any person for use by the latter for subsequent shipments provided such person is operating under a compliance agreement; and any such person may be authorized by an inspector to reproduce such forms on shipping containers or otherwise.

Any such person may use the limited permit forms, or reproductions of such forms, for interstate movement of regulated articles to specific destinations authorized by the inspector in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

(f) Any certificate or permit which has been issued or authorized may be withdrawn by the inspector if the inspector determines that the holder thereof has not complied with any condition for the use of such document imposed by this subpart.
