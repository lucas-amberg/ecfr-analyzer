# ยง 301.74-2   Regulated articles.

(a) The Administrator has determined that certain articles present a risk of spreading plum pox. A list of all such articles is found on the internet at *www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/plum-pox/plumpox.* Lists of all regulated articles may also be obtained by request from any local Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) office; local offices are listed in telephone directories and on the internet at *www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/ppq-program-overview/sphd.*

(1) If the Administrator determines that an article not already listed at *www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/plum-pox/plumpox* presents a risk of spreading plum pox, APHIS will publish a notice in the _Federal Register_ proposing to designate the article as a regulated article for plum pox. The notice will provide the basis for this determination, and will request public comment.


(2) If no comments are received on the notice, or if the comments do not change the Administrator's determination, APHIS will publish a second notice in the _Federal Register_ designating the article as a regulated article for plum pox and listing it.


(b) An inspector may designate any other product or article as a regulated article, if the inspector determines it to present a risk of spreading plum pox, and after the inspector notifies the person in possession of the product or article that it is subject to the restrictions in this subpart.
