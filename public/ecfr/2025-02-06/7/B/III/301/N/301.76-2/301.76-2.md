# ยง 301.76-2   Regulated articles for Asian citrus psyllid and citrus greening.

(a) *List of regulated articles.* The Administrator has determined that certain articles present a risk of spreading Asian citrus psyllid and/or citrus greening. A list of all such regulated articles is located at *www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/citrus/acp* and *www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/citrus/citrus-greening,* respectively. The list indicates whether the article is a regulated article for both citrus greening and Asian citrus psyllid, or just one of these two pests. Lists of all regulated articles may also be obtained by request from any local Plant Protection and Quarantine office; local offices are listed in telephone directories and on the internet at *www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/ppq-program-overview/sphd.*

(b) *Normal process for designating additional regulated articles.* (1) If the Administrator determines that an article not already listed at *www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/citrus/acpand/* or *www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/citrus/citrus-greeningpresentsariskofspreadingAsiancitruspsyllidand/* or citrus greening, APHIS will publish a notice in the _Federal Register_ proposing to designate the article as a regulated article for either or both of these pests. The notice will provide the basis for this determination, and will request public comment.


(2) If no comments are received on the notice, or if the comments do not change the Administrator's determination, APHIS will publish a second notice in the _Federal Register_ designating the article as a regulated article and listing it.


(c) *Immediate designation of regulated articles.* An inspector may designate any other product, article, or means of conveyance as a regulated article for Asian citrus psyllid and/or citrus greening, if the inspector determines that it presents a risk of spreading these pests, and after the inspector provides written notification to the person in possession of the product, article, or means of conveyance that it is subject to the restrictions of this subpart.


(d) *Exemption after certain methods of processing.* The Administrator may determine that certain methods of processing render regulated articles such that they no longer present a risk of spreading Asian citrus psyllid or citrus greening. Such methods are found at *www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/citrus.* Articles processed in such a manner are exempt from the regulations in this subpart.
