# ยง 301.81-2   Regulated articles.

(a) *List of regulated articles.* The Administrator has determined that certain articles present a risk of spread of the imported fire ant. A list of all such articles is found on the internet at *www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/imported-fire-ants/ct_imported_fire_ants*. Lists of all regulated articles may also be obtained by request from any local Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) office; local offices are listed in telephone directories and on the internet at *www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/ppq-program-overview/sphd*.


(b) *Normal process for designating additional regulated articles.* (1) If the Administrator determines that an article not already listed at *www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/imported-fire-ants/ct_imported_fire_ants* presents a risk of spread of the imported fire ant, APHIS will publish a notice in the _Federal Register_ proposing to designate the article as a regulated article for imported fire ant. The notice will provide the basis for this determination, and will request public comment.


(2) If no comments are received on the notice, or if the comments do not change the Administrator's determination, APHIS will publish a second notice in the _Federal Register_ designating the article as a regulated article for the imported fire ant and listing it.


(c) *Immediate designation of regulated articles.* An inspector may designate any other article or means of conveyance as a regulated article if the inspector determines that it presents a risk of spread of the imported fire ant due to its proximity to an infestation of the imported fire ant, and after the inspector provides notification to the person in possession of the article or means of conveyance that it is now regulated under this subpart.
