(A) The points of origin and destination are indicated on a waybill accompanying the regulated article; and


(B) The regulated article is moved through the quarantined area without stopping (except for refueling and for traffic conditions such as traffic lights and stop signs); and


(C) The regulated article is not unpacked or unloaded in the quarantined area; and


(D) The article has not been combined or commingled with other articles so as to lose its individual identity.

Articles found to be infested by an inspector, and articles not in compliance with the regulations in this subpart, may be seized, quarantined, treated, subjected to other remedial measures, destroyed, or otherwise disposed of.
