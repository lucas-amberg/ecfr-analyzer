# ยง 301.89-3   Regulated areas.

(a) *Designation.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the Administrator will list as a regulated area each State or portion of a State if it is determined to be infected with Karnal bunt or if it is in proximity to an infestation or inseparable from the infected locality for regulatory purposes based on the following: Projections of the spread of Karnal bunt along the periphery of the infestation, the availability of natural habitats and host materials within the noninfected acreage that are suitable for establishment and survival of Karnal bunt, and the necessity of including uninfected acreage within the regulated area in order to establish readily identifiable boundaries. The Administrator will publish a list of all regulated areas (the regulated areas list) on the PPQ website at *www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/karnal-bunt/ct_karnal_bunt*. The list will include the date that the list was last updated. Lists of all regulated areas may also be obtained by request from any local PPQ office; local offices are listed in telephone directors and on the internet at *www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/ppq-program-overview/sphd*. After a change is made to the list of regulated areas, APHIS will publish a notice in the _Federal Register_ informing the public that the change has occurred and describing the change to regulated areas.


(b) *Designation of less than an entire State as a regulated area.* Less than an entire State will be designated as a regulated area only if the Administrator:


(1)(i) Determines that the State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles that are equivalent to the movement restrictions imposed by this subpart; and


(ii) Determines that designating less than the entire State as a regulated area will prevent the spread of Karnal bunt; or


(2) Exercises his or her extraordinary emergency authority under 7 U.S.C. 7715.


(c) *Temporary designation of regulated areas.* The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any nonregulated area as a regulated area in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. The Administrator will give written notice of this designation to the owner or person in possession of the nonregulated area, or, in the case of publicly owned land, to the person responsible for the management of the nonregulated area. Thereafter, the movement of any regulated article from an area temporarily designated as a regulated area is subject to this subpart. As soon as practicable, this area either will be added to the regulated areas list, or the Administrator will terminate the designation. The owner or person in possession of, or, in the case of publicly owned land, the person responsible for the management of, an area for which the designation is terminated will be given written notice of the termination as soon as practicable.


(d) *Regulated fields.* The Administrator will classify a field or area as a regulated area when:


(1) It is a field planted with seed from a lot found to contain a bunted wheat kernel; or


(2) It is a distinct definable area that contains at least one field that was found during survey to contain a bunted wheat kernel (the distinct definable area may include an area where Karnal bunt is not known to exist but where intensive surveys are required because of the area's proximity to a field found during survey to contain a bunted kernel); or


(3) It is a distinct definable area that contains at least one field that has been determined to be associated with grain at a handling facility containing a bunted kernel of a host crop (the distinct definable area may include an area where Karnal bunt is not known to exist but where intensive surveys are required because of the area's proximity to the field associated with the bunted kernel at the handling facility).


(e) *Release from regulation.* A field known to have been infected with Karnal bunt, as well as any non-infected acreage surrounding the field, will be released from regulation if:


(1) The field has been permanently removed from crop production; or


(2) The field is tilled at least once per year for a total of 5 years (the years need not be consecutive). After tilling, the field may be planted with a crop or left fallow. If the field is planted with a host crop, the crop must test negative, through the absence of bunted kernels, for Karnal bunt.
