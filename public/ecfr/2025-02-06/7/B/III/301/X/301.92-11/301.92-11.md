(i) *Annual inspection, sampling, and testing*—(A) *Inspection*. The nursery must be inspected annually for symptoms of *Phytophthora ramorum* by an inspector. Inspectors will visually inspect for symptomatic plants throughout the nursery, and inspection will focus on, but not be limited to, regulated articles and associated articles.


(B) *Sampling.* A minimum of 40 plant samples must be tested per nursery location. Samples must be taken from all symptomatic plants if symptomatic plants are present. If fewer than 40 symptomatic plants are present, each symptomatic plant must be sampled and the remainder of the 40 sample minimum must be taken from asymptomatic plants. If no symptomatic plants are present, 40 asymptomatic plants must be sampled; biased toward proven hosts. Each sample may contain more than one leaf, and may come from more than one plant, but all plants in the sample must be from the same lot. Asymptomatic samples, if collected, must be taken from regulated and associated articles and nearby plants. Inspectors must conduct inspections at times when the best expression of symptoms is anticipated and must take nursery fungicide programs into consideration. Nursery owners must keep records of fungicide applications for 2 years and must make them available to inspectors upon request.


(C) *Testing.* Samples must be labeled and sent for testing to a laboratory approved by APHIS and must be tested using a test method approved by APHIS, in accordance with § 301.92-12.


(D) *Annual certification.* If all plant samples tested in accordance with this section and § 301.92-12 return negative results for *Phytophthora ramorum,* an inspector may certify that the nursery is free of evidence of *Phytophthora ramorum* infestation at the time of the inspection, and the nursery is eligible to enter into or maintain its compliance agreement in accordance with § 301.92-6.


(ii) *Pre-shipment inspection, sampling, and testing*—(A) *Inspection.* During the 30 days prior to interstate movement from a nursery in a quarantined area, regulated articles or associated articles intended for interstate movement must be inspected for symptoms of *Phytophthora ramorum* by an inspector. Inspection will focus on, but not be limited to, regulated articles and associated articles. No inspections of shipments will be conducted unless the nursery from which the shipment originates has a current and valid annual certification in accordance with this section.


(*1*) If no symptomatic plants are found upon inspection, the shipment may be considered free from evidence of *Phytophthora ramorum* and is eligible for interstate movement, provided that the nursery is operating under a compliance agreement with APHIS in accordance with § 301.92-6.


(*2*) If symptomatic plants are found upon inspection, the inspector will collect at least one sample per symptomatic plant, and one sample per regulated article or associated article that is in close proximity to, or that has had physical contact with, a symptomatic plant.


(B) *Testing and withholding from interstate movement.* Samples taken in accordance with this paragraph (a)(1) must be labeled and sent for testing to a laboratory approved by APHIS and must be tested using a test method approved by APHIS, in accordance with § 301.92-12.

(ii) *Sampling.* Samples must be taken from host plants, soil, standing water, drainage water, water for irrigation, and any other articles determined by the inspector to be possible sources of *Phytophthora ramorum* inoculum. The number of samples taken may vary depending on the possible sources of inoculum identified at the nursery, as well as the number of host articles in the nursery.


(iii) *Testing.* Samples must be labeled and sent for testing to a laboratory approved by APHIS and must be tested using a test method approved by APHIS in accordance with § 301.92-12.
