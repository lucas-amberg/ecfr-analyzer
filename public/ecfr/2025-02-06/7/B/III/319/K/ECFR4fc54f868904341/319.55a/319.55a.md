# § 319.55a   Administrative instructions relating to entry of rice straw and rice hulls into Guam.

Rice straw and rice hulls may be imported into Guam without further permit, other than the authorization contained in this paragraph. The port of entry shall be Agana or such other port as may be satisfactory to the inspector. Such importations may be made without the submission of a notice of arrival inasmuch as there is available to the inspector the essential information normally supplied by an importer at the time of importation. The requirements of §§ 319.55-6 and 319.55-7 shall not apply. Inspections of such importations may be made under the general authority of § 330.105(a) of this chapter. If an importation is found infected, infested, or contaminated by any plant pest and is not subject to disposal under this part, disposition may be made in accordance with § 330.106 of this chapter.
