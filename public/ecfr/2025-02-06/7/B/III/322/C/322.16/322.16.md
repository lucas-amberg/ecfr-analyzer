# § 322.16   Packaging of shipments.

(a) Restricted organisms must be packed in a container or combination of containers that will prevent the escape of the organisms and the leakage of any contained materials. The container must be sufficiently strong to prevent it from rupturing or breaking during shipment.


(b) The outer container must be clearly marked with the contents of the shipment, *i.e.,* either “Live Bees,” “Bee Germ Plasm,” or “Live Bee Brood,” and the name of the region of origin.


(c) Only approved packing materials may be used in a shipment of restricted organisms.


(1) The following materials are approved as packing materials: Absorbent cotton or processed cotton padding free of cottonseed; cages made of processed wood; cellulose materials; excelsior; felt; ground peat (peat moss); paper or paper products; phenolic resin foam; sawdust; sponge rubber; thread waste, twine, or cord; and vermiculite.


(2) Other materials, such as host material for the organism, soil, or other types of packing material, may be included in a container only if identified in the permit application and approved by APHIS on the permit.
