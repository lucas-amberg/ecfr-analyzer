(7) A written explanation of any discrepancies; and


(8) For select agents or material containing select agents or regulated nucleic acids that can produce infectious forms of any select agent virus that have been subjected to a validated inactivation procedure or a procedure for removal of viable select agent:


(i) A written description of the validated inactivation procedure or viable select agent removal method used, including validation data;


(ii) A written description of the viability testing protocol used;


(iii) A written description of the investigation conducted by the entity responsible official involving an inactivation or viable select agent removal failure and the corrective actions taken;


(iv) The name of each individual performing the validated inactivation or viable select agent removal method;


(v) The date(s) the validated inactivation or viable select agent removal method was completed;


(vi) The location where the validated inactivation or viable select agent removal method was performed; and


(vii) A certificate, signed by the principal investigator, that includes the date of inactivation or viable select agent removal, the validated inactivation or viable select agent removal method used, and the name of the principal investigator. A copy of the certificate must accompany any transfer of inactivated or select agent removed material.


(b) The individual or entity must implement a system to ensure that all records and databases created under this part are accurate and legible, have controlled access, and that their authenticity may be verified.
