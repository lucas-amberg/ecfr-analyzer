# § 400.98   Reconsideration process.

(a) This reconsideration process only applies to determinations of good farming practices under § 400.91(a)(2). 


(b) A determination or reconsideration decision regarding good farming practices is not an adverse action and cannot be appealed to NAD.


(c) Only reconsideration is available for determinations of good farming practices. Mediation is not available for determinations of good farming practices. 


(d) If the insured seeks reconsideration, the insured must file a written request for reconsideration to the following: USDA RMA Deputy Administrator for Insurance Services, Stop 0801, Room 2004-South ATTN: GFP RECONSIDERATION 1400 Independence Avenue SW Washington, DC 20250-0801, by email to *rma.rmsd@usda.gov,* or to a successor site or email.


(1) A request for reconsideration must be filed within 30 days of receipt of written notice of the determination regarding good farming practices. A request for reconsideration will be considered to have been “filed” when personally delivered in writing to FCIC or when the properly addressed request, postage paid, is postmarked. 


(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, an untimely request for reconsideration may be accepted and acted upon if the insured can demonstrate a physical inability to timely file the request for reconsideration. 


(3) Reconsideration of a good farming practice (GFP) determination will be limited to a closed review of the existing administrative record. The written request must state the basis upon which the insured relies to show that:


(i) The decision was not proper and not made in accordance with applicable program regulations and procedures; or


(ii) The previously provided material facts were not properly considered in such decision.


(e) With respect to determinations of good farming practices, the insured is not required to exhaust the administrative remedies in 7 CFR part 11 before bringing suit against FCIC in a United States district court. However, regardless of whether the Agency or the reinsured company makes the determination, the insured must seek reconsideration under § 400.98 before bringing suit against FCIC in a United States District Court. The insured cannot file suit against the reinsured company for determinations of good farming practices. 


(f) Any reconsideration decision by the Agency regarding good farming practices shall not be reversed or modified as a result of judicial review unless the reconsideration decision is found to be arbitrary or capricious.
