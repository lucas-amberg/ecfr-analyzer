# ยง 400.304   Nonstandard Classification determinations.

(a) Nonstandard Classification determinations can affect a change in assigned yields, premium rates, or both from those otherwise prescribed by the insurance actuarial tables.


(b) Changes of assigned yields based on insurance experience of insured acreage (or of a person on specific insured acreage) will be based on the simple average of available actual yields from the insured acreage during the base period.


(c) Changes of assigned yields based on insurance experience of a person without regard to any specific insured acreage will be determined by an assigned yield factor calculated by multiplying excess loss cost ratio by loss frequency and subtracting that product from 1.00 where:


(1) Excess loss cost ratio is total indemnities divided by total liabilities for all years of insurance experience in the base period and the result of which is then reduced by the cumulative earned premium rate, expressed as a decimal, and


(2) Loss frequency is the number of crop years in which an indemnity was paid divided by the number of crop years in which premiums were earned during the base period.


(d) Changes of premium rates will be made to reflect premium rates that would have resulted in insurance experience during the base period with a loss ratio of 1.00 but:


(1) A higher loss ratio than 1.00 may be used for premium rate determinations provided that the higher loss ratio is applied uniformly in a county; and


(2) If a Nonstandard Classification change has been made to current assigned yields, insurance experience during the base period will be adjusted to reflect the affects of changed assigned yields before changes of premium rates are calculated based on that experience.


(e) Once selection criteria have been met in any year, Nonstandard Classification adjustments will be made from year to year until no further changes are necessary in assigned yields or premium rates under the conditions set forth in ยง 400.304(f). In determining whether further changes are necessary, the eligibility criteria will be recomputed each subsequent year using the premium rates and yields which would have been applicable had this part not been in effect.


(f) Nonstandard Classification changes will not be made that:


(1) Increase assigned yields or decrease premium rates from those otherwise assigned by the actuarial tables, or


(2) Result in less than a 10 percent decrease in assigned yields or less than a 10 percent increase in premium rates from those otherwise assigned by the actuarial tables.
