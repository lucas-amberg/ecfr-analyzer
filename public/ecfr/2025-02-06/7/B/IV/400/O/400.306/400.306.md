(1) The spouse who was actively engaged in farming in a separate farming operation prior to their marriage will be a separate person with respect to that separate farming operation so long as that operation remains separate and distinct from any farming operation conducted by the other spouse;


(2) A minor child who is actively engaged in farming in a separate farming operation will be a separate person with respect to that separate farming operation if:


(i) The parent or other entity in which the parent has a substantial beneficial interest does not have any interest in the minor's separate farming operation or in any production from such operation;


(ii) The minor has established and maintains a separate household from the parent;


(iii) The minor personally carries out the farming activities with respect to the minor's farming operation; and


(iv) The minor establishes separate accounting and recordkeeping for the minor's farming operation.
