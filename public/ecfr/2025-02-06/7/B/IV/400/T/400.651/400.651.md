*Act.* The Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501 *et seq.*). 


*Additional coverage.* A level of coverage greater than catastrophic risk protection.


*Administrative fee.* An amount the producer must pay for catastrophic, and additional coverage each crop year on a per crop and county basis as specified in the Basic Provisions or the Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement.


*Approved insurance provider.* A private insurance company, including its agents, that has been approved and reinsured by FCIC to provide insurance coverage to producers participating in the Federal crop insurance program. 


*Approved yield.* The actual production history (APH) yield, calculated and approved by the verifier, used to determine the production guarantee by summing the yearly actual, assigned, adjusted or unadjusted transitional yields and dividing the sum by the number of yields contained in the database, which will always contain at least four yields. The database may contain up to 10 consecutive crop years of actual or assigned yields. The approved yield may have yield adjustments elected under applicable policy provisions, or other limitations according to FCIC approved procedures applied when calculating the approved yield.


*Catastrophic risk protection.* The minimum level of coverage offered by FCIC which is required before a person may qualify for certain other USDA program benefits unless the producer executes a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the crop. For the 1995 through 1998 crop years, such coverage will offer protection equal to fifty percent (50%) of the approved yield indemnified at sixty percent (60%) of the expected market price, or a comparable coverage as established by FCIC. For the 1999 and subsequent crop years, such coverage will offer protection equal to fifty percent (50%) of the approved yield indemnified at fifty-five percent (55%) of the expected market price, or a comparable coverage as established by FCIC. 


*Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement.* The part of the crop insurance policy that contains provisions of insurance that are specific to catastrophic risk protection. 


*Crop of economic significance.* A crop that has either contributed in the previous crop year, or is expected to contribute in the current crop year, ten percent (10%) or more of the total expected value of the producer's share of all crops grown in the county. However, a crop will not be considered a crop of economic significance if the expected liability under the Catastrophic Risk Protection Endorsement is equal to or less than the administrative fee required for the crop. 


*Expected market price.* (price election) The price per unit of production (or other basis as determined by FCIC) anticipated during the period the insured crop normally is marketed by producers. This price will be set by FCIC before the sales closing date for the crop. The expected market price may be less than the actual price paid by buyers if such price typically includes remuneration for significant amounts of post-production expenses such as conditioning, culling, sorting, packing, etc. 


*FCIC.* The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, a wholly owned Government Corporation within USDA. 


*FSA.* The Farm Service Agency, an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture or any successor agency. 


*Insurable interest.* The value of the producer's interest in the crop that is at risk from an insurable cause of loss during the insurance period. The maximum indemnity payable to the producer may not exceed the indemnity due on the producer's insurable interest at the time of loss. 


*Intended crop.* A crop stated on the application as submitted on or before the sales closing date for the crop which the producer intended to plant in the crop year for which application is made. 


*Linkage requirement.* The legal requirement that a producer must obtain at least catastrophic risk protection coverage for any crop of economic significance as a condition of receiving benefits for such crop from certain other USDA programs in accordance with ยง 400.655, unless the producer executes a waiver of any eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the crop. 


*Person.* An individual, partnership, association, corporation, estate, trust, or other legal entity, and wherever applicable, a state or a political subdivision or agency of a state.
