(b) Upon the Board's receipt of a 508(h) submission, the Board will:


(1) Determine if the 508(h) submission is complete (the date the Board votes to contract with expert reviewers is the date the 508(h) submission is deemed to be complete for the start of the 120 day time-period for approval);


(2) Unless the 508(h) submission makes non-significant changes to a policy or plan of insurance, or involves policy provisions that have already undergone expert review, forward the complete 508(h) submission to at least five expert reviewers to review the 508(h) submission:


(i) Of the five expert reviewers, no more than one will be employed by the Federal Government, and none may be employed by any approved insurance provider or their representative; and

(A) Protects the interests of agricultural producers and taxpayers;


(B) Is actuarially appropriate;


(C) Follows recognized insurance principles;

(J) May have a significant adverse impact on the crop insurance delivery system;


(K) The marketability assessment reasonably demonstrates the product would be viable and marketable (if the applicant cannot obtain a marketability assessment by another AIP, the Board shall presume that the submission is unmarketable);


(L) If applicable, contains a consultation report that provides evidence the 508(h) submission will not create adverse market distortions; and


(M) Meets any other criteria the Board may deem necessary;


(3) Return to the applicant any 508(h) submission the Board determines is not complete, along with an explanation of the reason for the determination and:


(i) With respect to 508(h) submissions developed from approved concept proposals, the provisions in § 400.712(c)(1) shall apply; and


(ii) Except for 508(h) submissions developed from concept proposals, if the 508(h) submission is resubmitted at a later date, it will be considered a new 508(h) submission solely for the purpose of determining the amount of time that the Board must take action; and


(4) For complete 508(h) submissions:


(i) Request review by RMA to provide its assessment of whether the 508(h) submission:


(A) Meets the criteria listed in subsections (b)(2)(ii)(A) through (M);

(c) Upon the Board's receipt of a concept proposal, the Board will:


(1) Determine whether the concept proposal is complete (the date the Board votes to contract with expert reviewers is the date the concept proposal is deemed to be a complete concept proposal for the start of the 120 day time-period for approval);


(2) If complete, forward the concept proposal to at least two expert reviewers with underwriting or actuarial experience to review the concept in accordance with section 522(b)(2) of the Act, this subpart, and Procedures Handbook 17030—Approved Procedures for Submission of Concept Proposals Seeking Advance Payment of Research and Development Costs;


(3) Return to the applicant any concept proposal the Board determines is not complete, along with an explanation of the reason for the determination (If the concept proposal is resubmitted at a later date, it will be considered a new concept proposal solely for the purposes of determining the amount of time that the Board must take action);


(4) Determine whether the concept proposal, if developed into a policy or plan of insurance would, in good faith, would meet the requirement of being likely to result in a viable and marketable policy consistent with section 508(h) (if the applicant cannot obtain a marketability assessment by another AIP, the Board shall presume that the submission is unmarketable);


(5) At its sole discretion, determine whether the concept proposal, if developed into a policy or plan of insurance would meet the requirement of providing coverage:

(2) If determined to be complete, contract with five expert reviewers and review the index-based weather plan of insurance in accordance with section 523(i) of the Act, this subpart, and Procedures Handbook 17050—Approved Procedures for Submission of Index-based Weather Plans of Insurance;


(3) Return to the applicant any index-based weather plan of insurance the Board determines is not complete, along with an explanation of the reason for the determination (if the index-based weather plan of insurance is resubmitted at a later date, it will be considered a new index-based weather plan of insurance solely for the purposes of determining the amount of time that the Board must take action); and


(4) Give the highest priority for approval of index-based weather plans of insurance that provide a new kind of coverage for specialty crops and livestock commodities that previously had no available crop insurance, or have demonstrated a low level of participation under existing coverage.


(e) All comments and evaluations will be provided to the Board by a date determined by the Board to allow the Board adequate time for review.

(1) First, consider policies or plans of insurance that address underserved commodities, including commodities for which there is no insurance;


(2) Second, consider existing policies or plans of insurance for which there is inadequate coverage or there exists low levels of participation; and


(3) Last, consider all policies or plans of insurance submitted to the Board that do not meet the criteria described in paragraph (g)(1) or (2) of this section.

(1) With respect to 508(h) submissions from concept proposals approved by the Board for advanced payment, the applicant must provide good cause why consideration should be delayed.


(2) Any requested time delay is not limited in the length of time unless a date is set by the Board by which all revisions to the 508(h) submission, concept proposal or index-based weather plan of insurance must be made. However, delays may make implementation of the 508(h) submission for the targeted crop year impractical or impossible as determined by the Board.


(3) The time period during which the Board will make a decision to approve or disapprove the 508(h) submission, concept proposal or index-based weather plan of insurance shall be extended commensurately with any time delay requested by the applicant.


(i) The applicant may withdraw a 508(h) submission, concept proposal, index-based weather plan of insurance, or a portion of a 508(h) submission or concept proposal, at any time by presenting a request to the Board. A withdrawn 508(h) submission, concept proposal or index-based weather plan of insurance that is resubmitted will be deemed a new 508(h) submission, concept proposal, or index-based weather plan of insurance solely for the purposes of determining the amount of time that the Board must take action.

(i) The 508(h) submission does not provide adequate coverage or treats producers disparately;


(ii) The applicant has not presented sufficient documentation that the 508(h) submission will provide a new kind of coverage that is likely to be viable and marketable (if the applicant cannot obtain a marketability assessment by another AIP, the Board shall presume that the submission is unmarketable);


(iii) Coverage would be similar to another policy or plan of insurance that has not demonstrated a low level of participation or does not contain a clear and identifiable flaw, and the producer would not significantly benefit from the 508(h) submission;


(iv) The 508(h) submission may create adverse market distortions or adversely impact other crops or agricultural commodities if marketed;


(v) The 508(h) submission will have a significant adverse impact on the private delivery system;

(ii) To a crop or region not traditionally served by the Federal crop insurance program; or


(iii) In a form that addresses a recognized flaw or problem in the program;


(3) The proposed budget and timetable are not reasonable, as determined by the Board; or


(4) The concept proposal fails to meet one or more requirements established by the Board.


(m) The Board shall provide a notice of intent to disapprove an index-based weather plan of insurance if it determines there is not:

(2) Sufficient assets or reinsurance to satisfy the underwriting obligations of the approved insurance provider, and possess a sufficient insurance credit rating from an appropriate credit rating bureau, in accordance with Board procedures; and


(3) Applicable authority and approval from each State in which the approved insurance provider intends to sell the insurance product.
