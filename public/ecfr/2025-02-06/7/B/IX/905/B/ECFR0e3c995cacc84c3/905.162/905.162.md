# ยง 905.162   Repacking certificate of privilege.

(a) *Application.* Application for a repacking certificate of privilege by a repacking shipper shall be made on an Application for a Repacking Certificate of Privilege form supplied by the committee. Each such application shall contain, but need not be limited to, the name, address and Florida citrus fruit dealer license number of the applicant; approximate number of boxes to be handled during the season; the various types of containers to be used to ship the repacked citrus fruit; a certification to the Secretary of Agriculture and to the committee as to the truthfulness of the information shown thereon; and any other appropriate information or documents deemed necessary by the committee or duly authorized agents for the purposes stated in ยง 905.161.


(b) *Approval.* The committee or its duly authorized agents shall give prompt consideration to each application for a repacking certificate of privilege. Approval of an application based upon a determination as to whether the information contained therein and other information available to the committee supports approval, shall be evidenced by the issuance of a repacking certificate of privilege to the applicant. Each such certificate shall expire at the end of the fiscal period.


(c) *Suspension or denial of certificate of privilege.* The committee may investigate the handling of repacked fresh citrus fruit shipments under certificates of privilege to determine whether repacking shippers are complying with the requirements and regulations applicable to such certificates. Whenever the committee finds that a repacking shipper is failing to comply with the requirements and regulations applicable to such certificates, the certificate of privilege issued to such repacking shipper may be suspended or, in the case of an application for the issuance of an initial certificate of privilege, may be denied. Such suspension of a certificate shall be for a reasonable period of time as determined by the committee, but in no event shall it extend beyond the end of the then current fiscal period. In the case of the denial of an application for the issuance of an initial certificate, such certificate shall be denied until the applicant comes into compliance with the requirements and regulations applicable to such certificates. Prior to suspending or denying an application for a certificate of privilege, the committee shall give the shipper or applicant an opportunity, either orally or in writing, to present opposing facts and reasons. The shipper or applicant shall be informed of the committee's determination in writing and in a timely manner.
