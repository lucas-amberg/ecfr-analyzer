# § 906.45   Inspection and certification.

(a) During any period in which handling of a variety of a type of fruit is regulated pursuant to §§ 906.34, 906.40, 906.42, or any combination thereof, no handler shall handle any variety of such type of fruit which has not been inspected by an authorized representative of the Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service, unless such handling is relieved from such requirements pursuant to § 906.41 or § 906.42, or both;


(b) Regrading, resorting, or repacking any lot of fruit shall invalidate any prior inspection insofar as the requirements of this section are concerned.

(c) Insofar as the requirements of this section are concerned, the length of time for which an inspection certificate is valid may be established by the committee with the approval of the Secretary;


(d) When fruit is inspected in accordance with the requirements of this section a copy of each inspection certificate issued shall be made available to the committee by the inspection service;


(e) The committee may recommend and the Secretary may require that any fruit handled or transported by motor vehicle shall be accompanied by a copy of the inspection certificate issued thereon, which certificate shall be surrendered to such authority as may be designated.
