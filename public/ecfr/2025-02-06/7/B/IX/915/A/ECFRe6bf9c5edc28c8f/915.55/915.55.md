Except as otherwise provided in this section, any person may, without regard to the provisions of §§ 915.41, 915.51, and 915.54, and the regulations issued thereunder, handle avocados (a) for consumption by charitable institutions; (b) for distribution by relief agencies; (c) for commercial processing into products; or (d) in such minimum quantities or types of shipments as the committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may prescribe. The committee shall, with the approval of the Secretary, prescribe such rules, regulations, and safeguards as it may deem necessary to prevent avocados handled under the provisions of this section from entering channels of trade for other than the specific purposes authorized by this section. Such rules, regulations, and safeguards may include the requirements that handlers shall file applications with the committee for authorization to handle avocados pursuant to this section, and that such applications be accompanied by a certification by the intended purchaser or receiver that the avocados will not be used for any purpose not authorized by this section.
