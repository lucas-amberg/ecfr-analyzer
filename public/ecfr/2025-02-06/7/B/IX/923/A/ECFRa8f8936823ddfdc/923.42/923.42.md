(a) If, at the end of a fiscal period, the assessments collected are in excess of expenses incurred, such excess shall be accounted for as follows:


(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, each person entitled to a proportionate refund of any excess assessment shall be credited with such refund against the operation of the following fiscal period unless such person demands repayment thereof, in which event it shall be paid to him: *Provided,* That any sum paid by a person in excess of his pro rata share of the expenses during any fiscal period may be applied by the committee at the end of such fiscal period to any outstanding obligations due the committee from such person.


(2) The Secretary, upon recommendation of the committee, may determine that it is appropriate for the maintenance and functioning of the committee that the funds remaining at the end of a fiscal period which are in excess of the expenses necessary for committee operations during such period may be carried over into following periods as a reserve. Such reserve may be established at an amount not to exceed approximately one fiscal period's operational expenses; and such reserve may be used to cover the necessary expenses of liquidation, in the event of termination of this part, and to cover the expenses incurred for the maintenance and functioning of the committee during any fiscal period when there is a crop failure, or during any period of suspension of any or all of the provisions of this part. Such reserve may also be used by the committee to finance its operations, during any fiscal period, prior to the time that assessment income is sufficient to cover such expenses; but any of the reserve funds so used shall be returned to the reserve as soon as assessment income is available for this purpose. Upon termination of this part, any funds not required to defray the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in such manner as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate: *Provided,* That to the extent practical, such funds shall be returned pro rata to the persons from whom such funds were collected.


(b) All funds received by the committee pursuant to the provisions of this part shall be used solely for the purposes specified in this part and shall be accounted for in the manner provided in this part. The Secretary may at any time require the committee and its members to account for all receipts and disbursements.


(c) Upon the removal or expiration of the term of office of any member of the committee, such member shall account for all receipts and disbursements and deliver all property and funds in his possession to his successor in office, and shall execute such assignments and other instruments as may be necessary or appropriate to vest in such successor full title to all of the property, funds, and claims vested in such member pursuant to this part.
