(2) The minimum net weight of grapes in any such containers, except for containers containing grapes packed in sawdust, cork, excelsior or similar packing material, or packed in bags or wrapped in plastic or paper, and containers authorized in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, shall be 20 pounds based on the average net weight of grapes in a representative sample of containers. Grapes in any such containers packed in bags, or wrapped in plastic or paper prior to being placed in these containers shall meet a minimum net weight of 18 pounds based on the average net weight of grapes in a representative sample of containers: *Provided,* That grapes packed in master containers containing individual consumer packages are exempt from container marking requirements and minimum net weight requirements. Containers of grapes other than master containers containing individual consumer packages shall be marked with the minimum net weight of 20 or 18 pounds. 


(3) Such containers of grapes shall be plainly marked with the minimum net weight of grapes contained therein (with numbers and letters at least one-fourth inch in height), the name of the variety of the grapes and the name of the shipper, as provided in §§ 1436.30 and 1359 of Title 3: California Code of Regulations.

(d) *Organically grown grapes.* Organically grown grapes (defined to mean grapes which have been grown for market as natural grapes by performing all the normal cultural practices, but not using any inorganic fertilizers or agricultural chemicals including insecticides, herbicides, and growth regulators, except sulfur) need not meet the minimum individual berry size requirements of this section if the following conditions and safeguards are met: (1) The handler of such grapes has registered and certified with the committee on a date specified by the committee the location of the vineyard, the acreage and variety of grapes, and such other information as may be needed by the committee to carry out these provisions; (2) each container of organically grown grapes bears the words “organically grown” on one outside end of the container in plain letters in addition to requirements specified under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.


(e) *By-product grapes.* The handling of grapes for processing (raisins, crushing and other by-products) is exempt from requirements specified in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section if the committee determines that the person handling such grapes has secured the appropriate permit or order from the County Agricultural Commissioner, and the by-product plant or packing plant to which the grapes are shipped has adequate facilities for commercial processing, grading, packing or manufacturing of by-products for resale.


(f) *Suspension of packing holidays.* Upon recommendation of the committee and approval of the Secretary, the prohibition against packing or repacking grapes on any Saturday, Sunday or on Memorial Day or Independence Day holidays of each year, may be modified or suspended to permit the handling of grapes provided such handling complies with procedures and safeguards specified by the committee as follows:

(3) The Committee members shall consider marketing conditions (i.e., supplies of competing commodities to include quantities in inventory, the expected demand conditions for grapes in different markets, and any pertinent documents which provide data on market conditions), weather conditions, labor shortages, the size of the crop remaining to be marketed, and other pertinent factors in reaching a decision to suspend packing holidays; 


(4) Once a vote is taken, any documents utilized during the meeting will be forwarded immediately to the Secretary's representative and a summary of the Committee's action and reasons for recommending approval or disapproval will be prepared and also forwarded by the committee; and 


(5) The Secretary's representative shall notify the Committee manager of approval or disapproval of the request prior to commencement of the suspended packing holiday and the Committee manager shall notify handlers and producers accordingly.
