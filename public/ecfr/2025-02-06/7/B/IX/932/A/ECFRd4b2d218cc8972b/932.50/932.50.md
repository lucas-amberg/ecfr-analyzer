# ยง 932.50   Report of marketing policy.

At least 14 days prior to the start of each crop year (except that this period may be shortened by the committee not more than 5 days if warranted), the committee shall hold a meeting for the purpose of formulating a marketing policy for the coming crop year: *Provided,* That with respect to the 1982-83 crop year the committee shall hold a meeting for such purpose as soon as practicable. The committee shall prepare and submit to the Secretary promptly after each such meeting, a report setting forth its recommended marketing policy for the ensuing crop year. In the event it becomes advisable to modify such policy, because of changed supply, demand, or other conditions, the committee shall formulate a new policy and shall submit a report thereon to the Secretary. In developing the marketing policy, the committee shall give consideration to the handler carryover, production, probable quality and composition of olive sizes in the crop, trade demand, probable imports, whether producer prices are likely to exceed parity, the probable assessable tonnage and such other factors as may have a bearing on the marketing of olives or the administration of this part. Notice of the committee's marketing policy, and of any modifications thereof, shall be given promptly by reasonable publicity to producers and handlers.
