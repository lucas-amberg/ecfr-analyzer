(a) The committee shall impose a late payment charge on any handler whose assessment has not been received in the committee's office, or the envelope containing the payment legibly postmarked by the U.S. Postal Service, within 30 days of the invoice date shown on the handler's assessment statement. The late payment charge shall be five percent of the unpaid balance.


(b) In addition to that specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the committee shall impose an interest charge on any handler whose assessment payment has not been received in the committee's office, or the envelope containing the payment legibly postmarked by the U.S. Postal Service, within 30 days of the invoice date. The interest charge shall be the current commercial prime rate of the committee's bank plus two percent which shall be applied to the unpaid balance and late payment charge for the number of days all or any part of the assessment specified in the handler's assessment statement is delinquent beyond the 30-day payment period.


(c) The committee, upon receipt of a late payment equal to or greater than the assessment specified on the handler's assessment statement, shall promptly notify the handler (by registered mail) of any late payment charge and/or interest due as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. If such charges are not paid, or the envelope containing payment is not legibly postmarked by the U.S. Postal Service, within 30 days of the date on such notification, late payment and interest charges as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will accrue on the unpaid amount.
