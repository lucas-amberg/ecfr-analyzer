An alternate member of the committee shall act in the place and stead of the member for whom such person is an alternate during such member's absence or when designated to do so by such member. In the event both a member of the committee and that member's alternate are unable to attend a committee meeting, the member, the alternate, or the committee, in that order, may designate another alternate from the same district (if applicable) and the same group (producer or producer-handler) to serve in such member's stead. Only the public member's alternate is authorized to serve in the place and stead of the public member. In the event of the death, removal, resignation or disqualification of a member, that member's alternate shall serve until a successor to such member is selected.
