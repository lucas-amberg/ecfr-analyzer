# ยง 959.125   Disqualification.

The committee from time to time may conduct surveys of handling of onions for special purposes requiring Certificates of Privilege to determine whether handlers are complying with the requirements and regulations applicable to such certificates. Whenever the committee finds that the handler or consignee is failing to comply with requirements and regulations applicable to handling of onions in special outlets and requiring such certificates, a Certificate or Certificates of Privilege issued such handler may be rescinded and subsequent certificates denied. Such disqualification shall apply to, and not exceed, a reasonable period of time as determined by the committee, but in no event shall it extend beyond the date of the succeeding fiscal period. Any handler who has a Certificate rescinded or denied may appeal to the committee in writing for reconsideration of his disqualification.
