(b) *Suspension or termination*—(1) *Failure to effectuate policy of act.* The Secretary shall terminate or suspend the operation of any or all of the provisions of this subpart, whenever he finds that such provisions do not tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act.


(2) The Secretary shall conduct a referendum as soon as practical after the end of the fiscal year ending two years after implementation of this amendment, and at such time every fifth year thereafter, to ascertain whether continuation of the order is favored by growers who have been engaged in the production of almonds for market within the State of California during the current crop year.


(3) *When favored by growers.* The Secretary shall terminate the provisions of this subpart at the end of any crop year whenever he finds that such termination is favored by a majority of the growers of almonds who during the crop year have been engaged in the production for market of almonds in the State of California: *Provided,* That such majority have during such period produced for market more than 50 percent of the volume of such almonds produced for market within said State; but such termination shall be effected only if announced on or before July 1 of the then current crop year.

Action by said trusteeship shall require the concurrence of a majority of the said trustees.


(2) *Duties of trustees.* Said trustees shall continue in such capacity until discharged by the Secretary; shall, from time to time, account for all receipts and disbursements and deliver all property on hand, together with all books and records of the Board and the joint trustees, to such person as the Secretary may direct; and shall, upon request of the Secretary, execute such assignments or other instruments necessary or appropriate to vest in such person full title and right to all of the funds, property, and claims vested in the Board or the joint trustees pursuant thereto.
