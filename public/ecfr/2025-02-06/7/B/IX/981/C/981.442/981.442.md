# § 981.442   Quality control.

(a) *Incoming.* Pursuant to § 981.42(a), the quantity of inedible kernels in each variety of almonds received by a handler, including almonds of his own production, shall be determined and disposed of in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.


(1) *Sampling.* Each handler shall cause a representative sample of almonds to be drawn from each lot of any variety received from any incoming source. The sample shall be drawn before inedible kernels are removed from the lot after hulling/shelling, or before the lot is processed or stored by the handler. For receipts at premises with mechanical sampling equipment and under contracts providing for payment by the handler to the grower for sound meat content, samples shall be drawn by the handler in a manner acceptable to the Board and the inspection agency. The inspection agency shall make periodic checks of the mechanical sampling procedures. For all other receipts, including but not limited to field examination and purchase receipts, accumulations purchased for cash at the handler's door or from an accumulator, or almonds of the handler's own production, sampling shall be conducted or monitored by the inspection agency in a manner acceptable to the Board. All samples shall be bagged and identified in a manner acceptable to the Board and the inspection agency.


(2) *Variety.* For the purpose of classifying receipts by variety to determine a handler's disposition obligation, “variety” shall mean that variety of almonds which constitutes at least 90 percent of the lot: *Provided,* That lots containing a combination of Butte and Padre varieties only, shall be classified as “Butte-Padre”, regardless of the percentage of each variety in the lot. If no variety constitutes at least 90 percent of the almonds in a lot, the lot shall be classified as “mixed”: *Provided further,* That if the variety or varieties of almonds in a lot are not identified, the lot shall be classified as “mixed”, regardless of the percentage of each variety in a lot.


(3) *Analysis of sample.* Each sample shall be analyzed by or under the surveillance of the inspection agency to determine the kernel content and the proportion of inedible kernels in the sample. The inspection agency shall prepare a report for each handler showing, by variety, the total adjusted kernel weight received by handler, the inedible kernel weight and any other information as the Board may prescribe. The report shall cover the handler's daily receipt or the handler's total receipts during a period not exceeding one week, and shall be submitted by the inspection agency to the Board and the handler.


(4) *Disposition obligation.* (i) The weight of inedible kernels in excess of 2 percent of kernel weight reported to the Board of any variety received by a handler shall constitute that handler's disposition obligation. For any almonds sold inshell, the weight may be reported to the Board and the disposition obligation for that variety reduced proportionately.


(ii) If a sufficient sample is not available for any lot of almonds, the handler may establish and substantiate, to the satisfaction of the Board, the received weight, the edible and inedible kernel weights, and the adjusted kernel weight by providing sufficient information as the Board may prescribe. If the handler is only able to establish and substantiate the approximate received weight, an inedible disposition obligation of 10 percent of such received weight may be applied, upon agreement between the Board and the handler.


(5) *Meeting the disposition obligation.* Each handler shall meet its disposition obligation by delivering packer pickouts, kernels rejected in blanching, pieces of kernels, meal accumulated in manufacturing, or other material, to Board-approved accepted users, which can include, but are not limited to, crushers, feed manufacturers, feeders, or dealers in nut wastes, located within the production area. Inedible kernels, foreign material, and other defects sorted from edible kernels by off-site cleaning facilities may be used towards that handler's disposition obligation or destroyed. Handlers shall notify the Board at least 72 hours prior to delivery of product to an off-site cleaning facility or accepted user location: *Provided,* That the Board or its employees may lessen this notification time whenever it determines that the 72-hour requirement is impracticable. The Board may supervise deliveries at its option. In the case of a handler having an annual total obligation of less than 1,000 pounds, delivery may be to the Board in lieu of an accepted user, in which case the Board would certify the disposition lot and report the results to the USDA. For dispositions by handlers with mechanical sampling equipment, samples may be drawn by the handler in a manner acceptable to the Board and the inspection agency. For all other dispositions, samples shall be drawn by or under supervision of the inspection agency. Upon approval by the Board and the inspection agency, sampling may be accomplished at the accepted user's destination. The edible and inedible almond meat content of each delivery shall be determined by the inspection agency and reported by the inspection agency to the Board and the handler. The handler's disposition obligation will be credited upon satisfactory completion of ABC Form 8. ABC Form 8, Part A, is filled out by the handler, and Part B by the accepted user. At least 50-percent of a handler's total crop year inedible disposition obligation shall be satisfied with dispositions consisting of inedible kernels as defined in § 981.408: *Provided,* That this 50 percent requirement shall not apply to handlers with total annual obligations of less than 1,000 pounds. Each handler's disposition obligation shall be satisfied when the almond meat content of the material delivered to accepted users equals the disposition obligation, but no later than September 30 succeeding the crop year in which the obligation was incurred. Almond meal can be used for meeting the non-inedible portion of the obligation. Meal content shall be determined in a manner acceptable to the Board.


(6) *Inedible almonds unfit for processing.* All lots received from growers as “inedible almonds unfit for processing,” shall be exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (a) (1) and (3) of this section, but shall be disposed of in their entirety (other than as pickouts), as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. Disposition of these lots shall not be credited toward the disposition obligation of paragraph (a)(4) of this section. If a grower sells or ships inedible almonds to a person other than a handler, the grower thereby becomes a handler and subject to all the requirements of this paragraph.


(7) *Accepted users.* An accepted user's eligibility shall be subject to the following criteria:


(i) Annual completion of an application with the Board for accepted user status;


(ii) Annual submission of a business data sheet to the Board;


(iii) Annual submission of an Accepted User Plan (Form ABC 30) to the Board by July 31 of each year;


(iv) The accurate and prompt submission of Form ABC 8, Part B, to the Board for each lot of almonds received. Each lot of inedible almonds received must be documented by a public weighmaster weight certificate issued at the request of the accepted user at the time of receipt of the lot. Weighmaster weight certificates must be submitted to the Board within 10 business days of issuance;


(v) Disposal of inedible almond material within 6 months of receipt; and


(vi) Disposal of inedible almond material received with no transfer of the material between accepted users.


(vii) The Board may deny or revoke accepted user status at any time if the applicant or accepted user fails to meet the terms and conditions of § 981.442, or if the applicant or accepted user fails to meet the terms and conditions set forth in the accepted user application (Form ABC 34).


(viii) The eligibility of accepted users shall be reviewed annually by the Board. Handlers will not receive credit towards their disposition obligations pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this section for inedible lots where the difference between the weight of the lot reported by the inspection agency on Form ABC 8 and the weight of the lot reported on the public weighmaster weight certificate exceeds 2.0 percent.


(b) *Outgoing.* Pursuant to § 981.42(b), and except as provided in § 981.13 and in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, handlers shall subject their almonds to a treatment process or processes prior to shipment to reduce potential *Salmonella* bacteria contamination in accordance with the provisions of this section. Temporary transfer by a handler to an off-site cleaning facility is not considered a shipment under this section. Handlers may utilize off-site cleaning facilities within the production area, on record with the Board, to provide sorting services to separate inedible kernels, foreign material, and other defects from edible kernels. Product sent by a handler to an off-site cleaning facility is considered a temporary transfer, with ownership maintained by the handler, and accountability required for all product fractions and handler obligations pursuant to § 981.42.


(1) *Treatment process.* Treatment processes shall utilize technologies that have been determined to achieve in total a minimum 4-log reduction of *Salmonella* bacteria in almonds, pursuant to a letter of determination issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or acceptance by a scientific review panel as identified by the Board (Technical Expert Review Panel or “TERP”). Such panel shall be approved at least annually by the Board prior to the beginning of each crop year, or as needed during the crop year.


(2) *On-site versus off-site treatment.* Handlers shall subject almonds to a treatment process or processes prior to shipment either at their handling facility (on-site) or a custom processor (defined as a Board-approved off-site treatment facility located within the production area subject to the provisions of paragraph (b)(4)(v) of this section). Transportation of almonds by a handler to a custom processor shall not be deemed a shipment. A handler with an on-site treatment process or processes may use such facility to act as a custom processor for other handlers.


(3) *Validation by process authorities.* Handlers shall only use, or transport their almonds to off-site treatment facilities that use treatment processes that have been validated by a Board-approved process authority. Treatment technology and equipment that have been modified to a point where operating parameters such as time, temperature, or volume change, shall be revalidated.


(i) Validation means that the treatment technology and equipment have been demonstrated to achieve in total a minimum 4-log reduction of *Salmonella* bacteria in almonds. Validation data prepared by a Board-approved process authority must be submitted to the Board, and accepted by the TERP, for each piece of equipment used to treat almonds prior to its use under the program.


(ii) A process authority is a person that has expert knowledge of appropriate processes for the treatment of almonds as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and meets the following criteria:


(A) Knowledge about the equipment used for the treatment process;


(B) Experience in conducting appropriate studies to determine the ability of the equipment to deliver the appropriate treatment (such as heat penetration or heat distribution); and


(C) Able to determine that sufficient data has been gathered to identify the critical factors needed to ensure the quality of the final product.


(iii) Process authorities may be employees of the entity for which they are conducting validation. The Board shall provide process authorities specific protocols and parameters for treatment processes that are FDA determined or TERP accepted.


(iv) Process authorities must submit an initial application to the Board on ABC Form No. 51, “Application for Process Authority for Almonds,” and be approved by the TERP. Should the applicant disagree with the TERP's decision concerning approval, the applicant may appeal the decision in writing to the Board, and ultimately to USDA. For subsequent crop years, approved applicants with no changes to their initial application must send the Board a letter, signed and dated, indicating that there are no changes to the application the Board has on file.


(v) The TERP, in coordination with the Board, may revoke any approval for cause. The Board shall notify the process authority in writing of the reasons for revoking the approval. Should the process authority disagree with the decision, they may appeal the decision in writing to the Board, and ultimately to USDA. A process authority whose approval has been revoked must submit a new application to the TERP and await approval.


(4) *Compliance and verification.* In accordance with the requirements of this paragraph, handlers shall utilize either an on-site verification program (traditional), or an audit-based verification program to ensure that their almonds have been subjected to a treatment process to reduce *Salmonella* bacteria prior to shipment. Each handler may decide which verification program would be the most cost-effective for his or her operation.


(i) By May 31, each handler shall submit to the Board a Handler Treatment Plan (Treatment Plan) for the upcoming crop year. A Treatment Plan shall describe how a handler plans to treat his or her almonds and must address specific parameters as outlined by the Board for the handler to ship almonds. Such plan shall be reviewed by the Board, in conjunction with the inspection agency, to ensure it is complete and can be verified, and be approved by the Board. Almonds sent by a handler for treatment at a custom processing facility affiliated with another handler shall be subject to the approved Treatment Plan utilized at that facility. Handlers shall follow their own approved Treatment Plans for almonds sent to custom processors that are not affiliated with another handler.


(ii) Handlers utilizing an on-site verification program shall cause the inspection agency to verify that their Treatment Plans have been followed, and that their almonds have been subjected to a treatment process that has been validated by a Board-approved process authority. Such handlers shall submit, or cause to be submitted, a verification report to the Board. The inspection agency must physically observe the treatment process to issue such report.


(iii) Handlers utilizing an audit-based verification program shall be subject to periodic audits conducted by the inspection agency. The inspection agency shall provide copies of the audit report to the Board. Handlers who do not comply with an audit-based verification program shall be required to revert to an on-site verification program.


(iv) Interhandler transfers of almonds may or may not be treated prior to transfer. Handlers receiving untreated almonds from another handler shall be responsible for treating the product. Handlers receiving treated almonds from another handler must have procedures outlined in their Treatment Plan addressing how the integrity of the treated almonds will be maintained. In all instances involving interhandler transfers, the receiving handler shall be responsible for ensuring that the almonds are treated prior to shipment and maintaining documentation to that effect.


(v) Custom processors shall provide access to the inspection agency and Board staff for verification of treatment and review of treatment records. Custom processors shall utilize technologies that have been determined to achieve, in total, a minimum 4-log reduction of Salmonella bacteria in almonds, pursuant to a letter of determination issued by FDA or accepted by the TERP. Custom processors must submit a Custom Processor Application, ABC Form 55, to the Board annually by July 31. A custom processor who submits a timely application, and utilizes a treatment process or processes that has been validated by a Board-approved process authority and approved by the Board in conjunction with the TERP, shall be approved by the Board for handler use. The Board may revoke any such approval for cause. The Board shall notify the custom processor of the reasons for revoking the approval. Should the custom processor disagree with the Board's decision, it may appeal the decision in writing to USDA. Handlers may treat their almonds only at custom processor treatment facilities that have been approved by the Board.


(5) *Records.* Handlers shall maintain records and documentation that will be subject to audit by the Board for the purpose of verifying compliance with this section. Records must be maintained for two full years following the end of the crop year, and must identify lots from the point of treatment forward to the point of shipment by the handler. Lot identification shall also provide the ability to differentiate treated from untreated product. Off-site treatment facilities that do not handle almonds pursuant to § 981.16, shall maintain treatment records for 2 full years following the end of a crop year and make such records available to the Board.


(6) *Exemptions.* Handlers may ship untreated almonds under the following conditions. For purposes of this section, container means a box, bin, bag, carton, or any other type of receptacle used in the packaging of bulk almonds.


(i) Handlers may ship untreated almonds for further processing directly to manufacturers located within the U.S., Canada, or Mexico. This program shall be termed the Direct Verifiable (DV) program. Handlers may only ship untreated almonds to manufacturers who have submitted ABC Form No. 52, “Application for Direct Verifiable (DV) Program for Further Processing of Untreated Almonds,” and have been approved by the Board. Such almonds must be shipped directly to approved manufacturing locations, as specified on Form No. 52. Such manufacturers (DV Users) must submit an initial Form No. 52 to the Board for review and approval in conjunction with the TERP. Should the applicant disagree with the Board's decision concerning approval, it may appeal the decision in writing to the Board, and ultimately to USDA. For subsequent crop years, approved DV Users with no changes to their initial application must send the Board a letter, signed and dated, indicating that there are no changes to the application the Board has on file. Approved DV Users desiring to make changes to their approved application must resubmit Form No. 52 to the Board for approval. The TERP, in coordination with the Board, may revoke any approval for cause. The Board shall notify the DV User in writing of the reasons for revoking the approval. Should the DV User disagree with the decision, it may appeal the decision in writing to the Board, and ultimately to USDA. A DV User whose approval has been revoked must submit a new application to the Board and await approval. The Board shall issue a DV User code to an approved DV User. Handlers must reference such code in all documentation accompanying the lot and identify each container of such almonds with the term “unpasteurized.” Such lettering shall be on one outside principal display panel, at least 
1/2 inch in height, clear and legible. If a third party is involved in the transaction, the handler must provide sufficient documentation to the Board to track the shipment from the handler's facility to the approved DV User. While a third party may be involved in such transactions, shipments to a third party and then to a manufacturing location are not permitted under the DV program. Approved DV Users shall:


(A) Subject such almonds to a treatment process or processes using technologies that achieve in total a minimum 4-log reduction of *Salmonella* bacteria as determined by the FDA or established by a process authority accepted by the TERP, in accordance with and subject to the provisions and procedures of paragraph (b)(3) of this section. Establish means that the treatment process and protocol have been evaluated to ensure the technology's ability to deliver a lethal treatment for *Salmonella* bacteria in almonds to achieve a minimum 4-log reduction;


(B) Identify the manufacturing locations where treatment will occur;


(C) Have their treatment technology and equipment validated by a Board approved process authority and accepted by the TERP. Documentation must be provided with their DV application to verify that their treatment technology and equipment have been validated by a Board-approved process authority. Such documentation shall be sufficient to demonstrate that the treatment processes and equipment achieve a 4-log reduction in *Salmonella* bacteria. Treatment technology and equipment that have been modified to a point where operating parameters such as time, temperature, or volume change, shall be revalidated;


(D) Have their technology and procedures verified by a Board-approved DV auditor to ensure they are being applied appropriately. A DV auditor may not be an employee of the manufacturer that they are auditing. A DV auditor may not be the same individual who conducted the process validation accepted by the TERP for the equipment being audited. DV auditors must submit a report to the Board after conducting each audit. DV auditors must submit an initial application to the Board on ABC Form No. 53, “Application for Direct Verifiable (DV) Program Auditors,” and be approved by the Board in coordination with the TERP. Should the applicant disagree with the decision concerning approval, they may appeal the decision in writing to the Board, and ultimately to USDA. For subsequent crop years, approved DV auditors with no changes to their initial application must send the Board a letter, signed and dated, indicating that there are no changes to the application the Board has on file. Approved DV auditors whose status has changed must submit a new application. The Board, in coordination with the TERP, may revoke any approval for cause. The Board shall notify the DV auditor in writing of the reasons for revoking the approval. Should the DV auditor disagree with the decision to revoke, it may appeal the decision in writing to the Board, and ultimately to USDA. A DV auditor whose approval has been revoked must submit a new application to the Board and await approval;


(E) Maintain all records regarding validation and verification of treatment methods, processing, and product traceability. Such records shall be retained for two years and shall be made available for review by the Board; and,


(F) Ship any almonds which will not be treated to a handler, to another approved DV user, to locations outside the U.S., Canada, and Mexico (containers must remain identified with the term “unpasteurized”), as specified in § 981.442(b)(6)(i), or dispose of such almonds in non-edible channels.


(ii) Handlers may ship untreated almonds directly or through a third party to locations outside the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, provided that each container of such almonds is identified with the term “unpasteurized.” Such lettering shall be on one outside principal display panel, at least 
1/2 inch in height, clear and legible. If a third party is involved in the transaction, the handler must provide sufficient documentation to the Board to track the shipment from the handler's facility to the importer in the foreign country.


(7) *Other restrictions.* The provisions of this section do not supersede any restrictions or prohibitions regarding almonds grown in California under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or any other applicable laws or regulations or the need to comply with applicable food and sanitary regulations of city, county, State or Federal agencies.
