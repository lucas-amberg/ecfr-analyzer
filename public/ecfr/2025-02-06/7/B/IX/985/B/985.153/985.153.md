# § 985.153   Issuance of additional allotment base to new and existing producers.

(a) *Definitions.* (1) *New producer* means any person who never was issued an allotment base by the Committee for a class of oil in any capacity either as an individual, or as a member of a partnership, corporation, or any other business unit.


(2) *Existing producer* means any person who was issued an allotment based by the Committee for a class of oil in any capacity either as an individual, or as a member of a partnership, corporation, or any other business unit. Any person who was initially issued an allotment base for a class of oil and changed identity of operation, as set forth in § 985.53(a), since April 14, 1980, and requests additional allotment base for that class of oil pursuant to this section, shall be deemed to be an existing producer.


(b) *Requests.* Any new or existing producer desiring additional allotment base for any class of oil made available by the Committee pursuant to § 985.53(d)(1) shall request such base by a date specified by the Committee prior to the marketing year for which such base will be made available.


(c) *Issuance*—(1) *New producers*—(i) *Regions:* For the purpose of issuing additional allotment base to new producers, the production area is divided into the following regions: 


(A) *Region A.* The State of Washington. 


(B) *Region B.* All areas of the production area outside the State of Washington. 


(ii) The Committee shall review all requests from new producers for additional allotment base made available pursuant to § 985.53(d)(1).


(iii) Each year, the Committee shall determine the size of the minimum economic enterprise required to produce each class of oil. The Committee shall thereafter calculate the number of new producers who will receive allotment base under this section for each class of oil. The Committee shall include that information in its announcements to new producers in each region informing them when to submit requests for allotment base. The Committee shall determine whether the new producers requesting additional base have the ability to produce spearmint oil. The names of all eligible new producers from each region shall be placed in separate lots per class of oil. For each class of oil, separate drawings shall be held from a list of all applicants from Region A and from a list of all applicants from Region B. If, in any marketing year, there are no requests for additional base in a class of oil from eligible new producers in a region, such unallocated additional allotment base shall be issued to an eligible new producer whose name is selected by drawing from a list containing the names of all remaining eligible new producers from the other region for that class of oil. The Committee shall immediately notify each new producer whose name was drawn and issue that producer an allotment base in the appropriate amount. Allotment base issued to new producers under this section shall not be transferred for at least five years following issuance.


(2) *Existing producers.* (i) The Committee shall review all requests from existing producers for additional allotment base. 


(ii) *Class 1 base.* With respect to the issuance of additional Class 1 allotment base to existing producers for the 2014-2015 through the 2016-2017 marketing years, existing producers with less than 5,121 pounds of allotment base as of October 17, 2012, who request additional allotment base and who have the ability to produce additional quantities of Class 1 spearmint oil, shall be issued additional allotment base sufficient to bring them up to a level not to exceed 5,121 pounds: *Provided,* That such additional Class 1 allotment base shall be allocated to eligible producers on a pro-rata basis from available additional Class 1 allotment base: *Provided further,* That additional allotment base shall not be issued to any person if such additional allotment base would replace all or part of an allotment base that such person has previously transferred to another producer. Additional allotment base in excess of the amount needed to bring eligible producers up to 5,121 pounds of Class 1 allotment base shall be distributed on a prorated basis among all existing producers who apply and who have the ability to produce additional quantities of spearmint oil.


(iii) *Class 3 base.* With respect to the issuance of additional Class 3 allotment base for existing producers for the 2014-2015 through the 2017-2018 marketing years, existing producers with less than 5,812 pounds of allotment base as of October 17, 2012, who request additional allotment base and who have the ability to produce additional quantities of Class 3 spearmint oil, shall be issued additional allotment base sufficient to bring them up to a level not to exceed 5,812 pounds: *Provided,* That such additional Class 3 allotment base shall be allocated to eligible producers on a pro-rata basis from available additional Class 3 allotment base: *Provided further,* That additional allotment base shall not be issued to any person if such additional allotment base would replace all or part of an allotment base that such person has previously transferred to another producer. Additional allotment base in excess of the amount needed to bring eligible producers up to 5,812 pounds of Class 3 allotment base shall be distributed on a prorated basis among all existing producers who apply and who have the ability to produce additional quantities of spearmint oil.


(iv) For each marketing year after 2016-2017 for Class 1 oil and 2017-2018 for Class 3 oil, each existing producer of a class of spearmint oil who requests additional allotment base, and who has the ability to produce additional quantities of that class of spearmint oil, shall be eligible to receive a share of the additional allotment base issued for that class of oil. Additional allotment base issued by the Committee for a class of oil shall be distributed on a prorated basis among the eligible producers for that class of oil. The Committee shall immediately notify each producer who is to receive additional allotment base by issuing that producer an allotment base in the appropriate amount. Allotment base issued to existing producers under this section shall not be transferred for at least two years following issuance, except that additional allotment base allocated pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)(ii) and (c)(2)(iii) of this section shall not be transferred for at least five years following issuance.


(d) The person receiving additional allotment base pursuant to this section shall submit to the Committee evidence of an ability to produce and sell oil from such allotment base in the first marketing year following issuance of such base.
