(a) *General.* Surplus dates delivered to the Committee pursuant to ยง 987.47 shall be pooled for sale to livestock feeders, distillers, or manufacturers of inedible products: *Provided,* That if any portion of the deliveries differs sufficiently to require separate handling, and earn a different average return, such portion shall be handled as a separate pool. The income from sale of surplus, after deduction of committee expenses, shall be paid to the respective equity holders in the pool or pools, or to their assignees, on the basis of the weight of dates each delivered.


(b) *Delivery.* The Committee may refuse delivery of any surplus dates which it determines are excessively soured, fermented, or adulterated by palm debris, rocks, paper, wood, plastic liners, or other foreign material. If the Committee refuses delivery, the deliverer shall be permitted to clean such dates sufficiently to make them acceptable to the Committee. The weight of each accepted delivery shall be that determined by a public weightmaster or, in the absence of such weight, that determined by the Committee on the basis of the number and size of the containers used in the delivery.
