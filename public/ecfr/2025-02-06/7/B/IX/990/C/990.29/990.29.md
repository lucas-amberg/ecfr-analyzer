Violations of this part shall be subject to enforcement in accordance with the terms of this section.


(a) *Negligent violations.* Hemp producers are not subject to more than one negligent violation per calendar year. A hemp producer shall be subject to enforcement for negligently:


(1) Failing to provide an accurate legal description of land where hemp is produced;


(2) Producing hemp without a license; and

(b) *Corrective action for negligent violations.* For each negligent violation, USDA will issue a Notice of Violation and require a corrective action plan from the producer. The producer shall comply with the corrective action plan to cure the negligent violation. Corrective action plans will be in place for a minimum of two (2) years from the date of their approval. Corrective action plans will, at a minimum, include:


(1) The date by which the producer shall correct each negligent violation;


(2) Steps that will be taken to correct each negligent violation; and


(3) A description of the procedures that will demonstrate compliance must be submitted to USDA.


(c) *Negligent violations and criminal enforcement.* A producer who negligently violates this part shall not, as a result of that violation, be subject to any criminal enforcement action by any Federal, State, Tribal, or local government.


(d) *Subsequent negligent violations.* If a subsequent negligent violation occurs while a corrective action plan is in place, a new corrective action plan must be submitted with a heightened level of quality control, staff training, and quantifiable action measures.


(e) *Negligent violations and license revocation.* A producer that negligently violates the license 3 times in a 5-year period shall have their license revoked and be ineligible to produce hemp for a period of 5 years beginning on the date of the third violation.


(f) *Culpable mental state greater than negligence.* If USDA determines that a licensee has violated the terms of the license or of this part with a culpable mental state greater than negligence:


(1) USDA shall immediately report the licensee to:


(i) The U.S. Attorney General; and


(ii) The chief law enforcement officer of the State or Indian territory, as applicable, where the production is located; and
