# ยง 5001.9   Standards for financial information.

(a) All financial information (*e.g.,* financial statements, balance sheets, financial projections, and income statements) must be prepared and submitted in accordance with accounting practices acceptable to the Agency. Such practices can include, but are not limited to, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the industry's standard accounting practice. Unless the applicant or borrower meets the threshold for an audit in accordance with 2 CFR part 200 subpart F, the type of financial statement, *e.g.,* borrower prepared, compiled, reviewed, or audited, required is typically the decision of the lender.


(b) For sole proprietorships and other situations where business assets are held personally, financial statements must be prepared using only the assets and liabilities directly attributable to the applicant's project. For these situations, assets, plus any improvements, must be valued at the lower of cost or market value.


(c) A tax return is not an acceptable financial statement when underwriting a loan guaranteed under this part; however, tax return information may be used to prepare financial statements and to determine REAP eligibility.
