If a loan note guarantee or assignment guarantee agreement has been lost, stolen, destroyed, mutilated, or defaced while in the custody of the lender or holder, the Agency may issue a replacement to the lender or holder, as applicable under the conditions described in paragraphs (a) through (b) of this section. The lender is prohibited from altering or modifying or approving any alterations to or modifications of any loan documents without the prior written approval of the Agency.


(a) *Replacement requirements.* The lender must coordinate the activities of the party who seeks the replacement documents and must submit the required documents to the Agency for processing. The requirements for replacement are as follows:


(1) A written statement of loss which includes:


(i) Legal name and present address of either the lender or the holder who is requesting the replacement forms;


(ii) Legal name and address of the lender of record;


(iii) Capacity of person certifying;


(iv) Full identification of the loan note guarantee or assignment guarantee agreement including the name of the borrower, the Agency's case number, date of the loan note guarantee or assignment guarantee agreement, face amount of the promissory note in which an interest was purchased, date of the promissory note, present balance of the guaranteed loan, percentage of guarantee, and, if an assignment guarantee agreement, the original named holder and the percentage of the guaranteed portion of the guaranteed loan assigned to that holder.

(v) A full statement of circumstances of the loss, theft, destruction, defacement, or mutilation of the loan note guarantee or assignment guarantee agreement; and


(vi) For the holder, evidence demonstrating current ownership of the assignment guarantee agreement. If the present holder is not the same as the original holder, the lender must include a copy of the endorsement of each successive holder in the chain of transfer from the initial holder to present holder. If copies of the endorsement cannot be obtained, the lender must submit the best available records of transfer (*e.g.,* order confirmation, canceled checks, etc.).


(b) *Indemnity bond.* An indemnity bond acceptable to the Agency must accompany the request for replacement except when the holder is the United States, a Federal Reserve Bank, a Federal Government corporation, a State or territory, the District of Columbia or a federally recognized tribal entity. The indemnity bond must:
