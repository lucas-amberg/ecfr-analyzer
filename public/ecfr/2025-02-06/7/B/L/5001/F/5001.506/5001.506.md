# § 5001.506   Loan transfers and assumptions.

(a) *General.* A lender must obtain prior written Agency approval in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section before the lender conducts a transfer and assumption of a guaranteed loan. The transferee will assume a loan amount at least equal to the outstanding loan balance or the present market value of the collateral, whichever is less. If the transferor is to receive a payment for their equity, the total debt must be assumed. The following conditions must be met:


(1) All transfers and assumptions will have a fee as provided by § 5001.509(b).


(2) For each transfer and assumption, the lender must concur in plans for the disposition of funds, if any, in the transferor's debt service, operations and maintenance, or other reserve accounts.


(3) The lender must confirm that the transfer and assumption can be completed in accordance with applicable laws.


(4) The lender must confirm that the conveyance instruments will be filed, registered, and recorded as appropriate and legally permissible. The transfer and assumption must be made on the Lender's form of assumption agreement and contain the Agency case number of the transferor and transferee. The lender must provide the Agency with a copy of the assumption agreement.


(5) The lender may request a transfer and assumption when the total indebtedness, or less than the total indebtedness, of the guaranteed loan is assumed by another borrower. If the assumption is for less than the total indebtedness, the transfer and assumption must be an arm's length transaction and the transfer must be of all loan collateral.


(6) In the event of default of the guaranteed loan, a transfer and assumption of the borrower's operation and guaranteed loan can be accomplished before or after the loan goes into liquidation. However, if the collateral has been purchased through foreclosure or the borrower has conveyed title to the lender, no transfer and assumption is permitted.


(7) No transfer and assumption is permitted when the Agency has repurchased any guaranteed portion of the guaranteed portion of the loan.


(8) If the transfer is for less than the total indebtedness, the pro rata share of an eligible loss will be paid to the lender after execution of the transfer and assumption documents.


(b) *Documentation.* The lender will provide to the Agency documentation to support the transferee's status as an eligible borrower, and such other documentation as the Agency may request to determine eligibility and credit evaluation.


(1) The new borrower must sign an Agency-approved application form.


(2) The Agency will require personal and/or corporate guarantee(s) in accordance with § 5001.204 of this part, as applicable. Any required new personal, partnership or corporate guarantors of the transferred guaranteed loan must sign an Agency approved guarantee form.


(c) *Agency approval.* The Agency will only approve a transfer and assumption if the transferee will continue the eligible purpose of the guaranteed loan and such transfer and assumption complies with the conditions specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section, as applicable.


(1) Whenever the transferor and transferee are affiliates or related parties, the transfer and assumption must:


(i) Be to an eligible borrower to continue the project for eligible purposes;


(ii) Transfer all the loan collateral; and


(iii) Be for the full amount of the guaranteed loan indebtedness.


(2) A transfer and assumption may be approved when the present borrower is unable or unwilling to accomplish the objectives of the guaranteed loan, and the transfer will be in the best financial interest of the borrower and the Agency.


(3) The Agency prefers to transfer to an eligible borrower subject to the policies and procedures governing the type of guaranteed loan being made, however the Agency will consider approving a transfer of a guaranteed loan to an ineligible borrower only if:


(i) The sale price is greater than it would be if the transfer was to an eligible borrower;


(ii) The transfer to an ineligible borrower is needed as a method for servicing a problem case; or


(iii) When an eligible borrower is not available. All transfers to an ineligible borrower must meet the following requirements:


(A) Transfer fees will be collected, and payments applied, in accordance with § 5001.509(b);


(B) The ineligible borrower agrees to pay the loan balance within the remaining term of the original guaranteed loan in periodic installments that will not result in a balloon payment at the loan's maturity;


(C) Interest rates are at the rate specified in the promissory note of the transferor or at rates customarily charged borrowers in similar circumstances in the ordinary course of business. The rates can be either fixed or variable, and are subject to Agency review and approval;


(D) The ineligible borrower must have the legal authority to enter into the contract and have the ability to repay the loan, as determined by the lender and the Agency. The ineligible borrower must submit a current balance sheet to the lender. The lender must obtain and analyze the credit history of the ineligible borrower.


(d) *Release of liability.* The transferor, including any guarantor, can be released from liability only with prior Agency written approval when the transfer and assumption is for the full outstanding balance of the guaranteed loan. If the assumption is for less than the full amount of the loan and the Agency pays a loss to the lender, the transferor, including any guarantor, are specifically subject to the Debt Collection Improvement Act provisions unless other workout arrangements have been made.


(e) *Loan agreement.* A new loan agreement or an assumption agreement, acceptable to the Agency must be executed to establish the terms and conditions of the loan being assumed.




(f) *Changes in loan terms.* When a transfer or assumption is made to an eligible borrower continuing the project for eligible purposes, the loan terms may remain the same or may be changed whether the transfer is for the total indebtedness or less than the total indebtedness. If the loan terms are to be changed, the lender must submit a request in accordance with this paragraph (f). The changed loan terms must be concurred to by the Agency, all holders, and the transferee (including guarantors). If there are changes in loan terms, the lender's request will require the following:


(1) An explanation of the reasons for the proposed change in the loan terms, and


(2) Certification that the lien position securing the guaranteed loan will be maintained or improved, and proper insurances will continue to be in effect.


(g) *Loan note guarantee.* The lender is responsible for noting each transfer and assumption on all originals of the loan note guarantee.


(h) *Proceeds.* Before the transfer and assumption is closed, the lender must credit any proceeds received from the sale of collateral to the transferor's guaranteed loan debt in order of lien priority.


(i) *Additional loans.* Guaranteed loans may be used to provide additional funds in connection with a transfer and assumption. The Agency will consider approving a guaranteed loan to provide additional funds in connection with a transfer and assumption pursuant to the lender's submission of a complete application in accordance with 7 CFR part 5001, subpart D.


(j) *Credit quality.* The lender must make a complete credit evaluation in accordance with § 5001.202 of this part to determine viability of the project (subject to the Agency review and approval) including any requirement for deposits in an escrow account as security to meet the applicable equity requirements for the project.


(k) *Appraisals.* If the proposed transfer and assumption is for less than the full amount of the guaranteed loan, an appraisal is required on all the collateral being transferred, and the amount of the assumption must not be less than this appraised value. The lender is responsible for obtaining the appraisal, which must conform to the requirements of § 5001.203 of this part. However, if the original appraisal is more than one year old, but less than two years old, the lender may provide an appraisal with a new effective date of evaluation in lieu of a completely new appraisal.




(l) *Legal opinion.* Prior to Agency approval, the lender must provide the Agency a preliminary written legal opinion that the guaranteed loan can be properly and legally transferred and assurance that the conveyance instruments will be appropriately filed, registered, and recorded. Upon execution of the transfer and assumption, the lender must provide the Agency with a final legal opinion that the assumption is completed, valid, and enforceable, and the assumption is consistent with the conditions outlined in the Agency's conditions of approval for the transfer and complies with all Agency regulations.


(m) *Promissory notes.* The lender must not issue any new promissory notes, release any mortgages and/or deeds of trust on the existing debt being transferred. An allonge may be attached to existing promissory notes as needed.


(n) *Loss/repurchase resulting from transfer and assumption.* (1) Any resulting loss must be processed in accordance with § 5001.521.


(2) If a holder owns any of the guaranteed portion of the loan, such portion must be repurchased by the lender or the Agency in accordance with § 5001.511.


(o) *Cash down payment.* The lender may allow the transferee to make cash down payments directly to the transferor provided:


(1) The transfer and assumption are made for the total indebtedness to an eligible borrower to continue the project for eligible purposes;


(2) The lender recommends that the cash be released, and the Agency concurs prior to the assumption being completed. The lender can require that an amount be retained for a defined period of time as a reserve against future defaults. Interest on such account may be paid periodically to the transferor or transferee as agreed; and


(3) The lender determines that the transferee has the repayment ability to meet the obligations of the assumed guaranteed loan as well as any other indebtedness.


(p) *Change in control of borrower.* The Agency will deem that a transfer and assumption has occurred whenever there is a significant change in the control of the borrower.
