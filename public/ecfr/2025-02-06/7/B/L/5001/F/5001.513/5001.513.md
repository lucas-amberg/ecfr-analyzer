# ยง 5001.513   Interest rate changes.

(a) *Interest rate freezes.* The guaranteed loan interest rate will freeze at the earliest uncured default date and will remain unchanged until the cancellation of the loan note guarantee in compliance with ยง 5001.524.


(b) *Reductions.* The borrower, lender, and holder (if any) may collectively initiate a permanent or temporary reduction in the interest rate of the guaranteed loan at any time during the life of the loan upon written agreement among these parties. After a permanent reduction, the loan note guarantee will only cover losses of interest at the reduced interest rate.


(1) When the Agency is a holder, the lender must obtain Agency approval before implementing the reduction. The lender must provide a copy of the modification agreement to the Agency for approval. The Agency will approve the reduction only when it is demonstrated that the change is more viable than liquidation and that the government's financial interests are not adversely affected.


(2) Factors that the Agency will consider in determining whether to approve the change are the Government's cost of borrowing money; the monetary recovery is greater than the liquidation recovery; and the project's continued viability as demonstrated by a financial feasibility analysis.


(c) *Increases.* Unless a temporary interest rate reduction occurred, increases in fixed interest rates and increases in variable interest rate structure are prohibited.


(d) *Fixed rate to variable rate change.* Fixed rates can be changed to variable rates to reduce the borrower's interest rate only when the variable rate has a ceiling that is less than or equal to the original fixed rate.




(e) *Variable rate to fixed rate change.* Variable rates can be changed to a fixed rate at the request of the borrower, agreement of the holder, if any, and Agency concurrence.




(f) *After adjustments.* The interest rates, after adjustments, must comply with the requirements for interest rates on new loans as established by paragraph ยง 5001.401.


(g) *Documentation.* The lender is responsible for the legal documentation of interest rate changes by an endorsement or any other legally effective amendment to the promissory note; however, no new promissory notes can be issued. The lender must provide copies of all such documents to the Agency within 10 calendar days of the change.


(3) In a final loss settlement when qualifying interest rate changes are made in compliance with this part, the lender must calculate interest based on the periods the given rates were in effect. The lender must maintain records that adequately document the accrued interest claimed, which must be determined in accordance with ยง 5001.450(c).
