# ยง 5001.522   Future recovery.

After a final loss claim has been paid, the lender must use reasonable efforts to collect from any party still liable for future recovery unless the Agency notifies the lender otherwise. Any net proceeds from future recovery will be split pro rata between the lender and the Agency based on the percent of the loan guarantee even if the loan note guarantee has been terminated. Once the Agency determines a debt is Federal debt and provides notice to the lender, that Federal debt is excluded from future recovery. The lender must cease all collection efforts against the borrower and any individual or corporate guarantors upon referral of the debts by the Agency for collection in accordance with part 3 of this title. The Agency will not share with the lender any collection of Federal debt made by the Federal Government from any liable party to the guaranteed loan.
