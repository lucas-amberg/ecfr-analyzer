# § 500.25   Payment of fees.

(a) Unless provided otherwise, all payments due under this subpart must be made by cash, check, or money order (in U.S. funds). Checks and money orders for payment of any fees imposed under this part are to be made payable, in U.S. funds, to the “U.S. National Arboretum.” Upon request, the USNA shall provide receipts to requesters for their records or billing purposes. If the USNA enters into an agreement to allow USNA visitors and users to make payment in the form of a credit card, USNA visitors and users who are assessed user fees may pay those fees with a credit card subject to the terms and conditions of such agreement.


(b) Any fees that become past due shall be collected in accordance with 7 CFR part 3.
