# ยง 505.6   Payment of fees.

NAL charges for interlibrary loans through OCLC's IFM Program (an electronic debit/credit payment program for libraries using OCLC's resource sharing service) or by invoice through the National Technical Information Service (NTIS) of the United States Department of Commerce. Payment for invoiced services will be made by check, money order, or credit card in U.S. funds directly to NTIS upon receipt of invoice from NTIS. NAL encourages users to establish deposit accounts with NTIS for payment of interlibrary loan fees. Subject to a reduction for the actual costs of performing the invoicing service by NTIS, all funds will be returned to NAL for credit to the appropriations account charged with the cost of processing the interlibrary loan request.
