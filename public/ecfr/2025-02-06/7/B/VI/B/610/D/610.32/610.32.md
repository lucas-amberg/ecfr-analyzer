# ยง 610.32   Technical assistance furnished.

(a) Provide technical assistance to grazing-land owners and managers to plan and implement resource conservation on grazing land.

(5) Maintain and improve water quality and quantity, aquatic and wildlife habitat, recreational opportunities, and aesthetics on private grazing land; 


(6) Harvest, process, and market private grazing land resources; and 


(7) Identify opportunities to diversify private grazing land enterprises.
