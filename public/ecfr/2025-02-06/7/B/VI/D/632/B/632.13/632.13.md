# ยง 632.13   Eligible lands and water.

Lands and water eligible for reclamation are those that were mined for coal or were affected by coal-mining processes and were abandoned or inadequately reclaimed before August 3, 1977. These lands and water are not eligible if:


(a) There is continuing reclamation responsibility on the part of a mine operator, permittee, or agent under State or Federal law or on the part of the State as a result of bond forfeiture. However, if the amount of the bond forfeiture was insufficient to reclaim the area covered by the bond, the area will be considered eligible. 


(b) They are under Federal ownership and control. 


(c) The surface rights are under easement or lease to be remined for coal or other minerals.
