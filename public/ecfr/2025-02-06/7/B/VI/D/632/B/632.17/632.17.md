# ยง 632.17   Cost-share rates.

(a) Cost-share rates paid by the Federal Government are to be established and issued as instructions by the NRCS Administrator in accordance with the following criteria: 


(1) For 120 acres or less, the cost-share rate is to provide up to 80 percent of the costs of land use and conservation treatment depending on the income-producing potential of the land after reclamation. However, this rate may be increased to a level required to obtain participation if the main benefits of reclamation are offsite (in the public interest) and there is a declaration of financial burden by the participant. 


(2) The rate on acreage in excess of 120 acres up to 320 acres maximum is to be reduced by up to 0.5 percent per acre. This reduced rate applies to the entire acreage offered for contract.
