(c) *Eligible land.* (1) The NRCS shall determine whether land is eligible for enrollment and whether, once found eligible, the lands may be included in the program based on the likelihood of successful protection of wetland functions and values when considering the cost of entering the agreement and protection costs.

(3) Land which is set aside or diverted under any other program administered by the Department of Agriculture;


(4) Land which is harvested in the first year of the agreement period prior to being designated, except for land on which timber is harvested in accordance with a Forest Management Plan which is included in the conservation plan and is approved by the State forester or equivalent State official;


(5) Lands where implementation of agreement practices would be futile due to on-site or off-site conditions; and


(6) Land on which the ownership has changed during the 2-year period preceding the first year of the agreement period unless:


(i) The new ownership was acquired by will or succession as a result of the death of the previous owner,


(ii) The land was acquired by the owner or operator to replace eligible land from which he was displaced because of its acquisition by any Federal, State, or other agency having the right of eminent domain, or


(iii) The new owner operated the land to be designated for as long as 2 years preceding the first year of the agreement and has control of such land for the agreement period.
