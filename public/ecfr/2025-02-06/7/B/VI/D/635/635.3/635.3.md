# § 635.3   Reliance on incorrect actions or information.

The Chief may grant equitable relief to any participant that NRCS determines is not in compliance with the requirements, terms and conditions of a covered program, and therefore ineligible for a payment, or other benefit, if the participant—


(a) Acting in good faith, relied on action and advice from an NRCS employee or representative of USDA to their detriment;


(b) Did not know or have sufficient reason to know that the action or advice upon which they relied would be detrimental; and


(c) Did not act in reliance on their own misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the program provisions, notices, or information.
