# ยง 650.8   When to prepare an environmental assessment (EA).

An environmental assessment (EA) is to be prepared for:


(a) Land and water resource projects that are not included in ยง 650.7(a) (1) through (4) for which State and local units of government receive Federal technical and financial assistance from NRCS (7 CFR parts 620 through 623; and 640 through 643); and 


(b) Other actions that the EE reveals may be a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.


(c) Criteria for determining the need for a program EA:


(1) A program EA is to be prepared when NRCS has determined, based on the environmental evaluation, that a program EIS is not required and the program and actions to implement the program are not categorically excluded; and


(2) A program EA may also be prepared to aid in NRCS decision-making and to aid in compliance with NEPA.


(d) The RFO, through the process of tiering, is to determine if a site-specific EA or EIS is required for an action that is included in a program EA or EIS.
