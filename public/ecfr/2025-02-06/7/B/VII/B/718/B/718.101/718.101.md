# ยง 718.101   Measurements.

(a) Measurement services include, but are not limited to, measuring land and crop areas, measuring quantities of farm-stored commodities, and appraising the yields of crops in the field when required for program administration purposes. The county committee will provide measurement service if the producer requests such service and pays the cost, except that measurement service is not available and will not be provided to determine total acreage or production of a crop when the request is made:


(1) For acreage, after the established final reporting date for the applicable crop, unless a late filed report is accepted as provided in ยง 718.104; or


(2) After the farm operator has furnished production evidence when required for program administration purposes except as provided in this subpart.


(b) Except for measurements and determinations performed by FSA in accordance with late-filed acreage reports filed in accordance with ยง 718.104, when a producer requests, pays for, and receives written notice that measurement services have been furnished, the measured acreage is guaranteed to be correct and used for all program purposes for the current year even though an error is later discovered in the measurement.
