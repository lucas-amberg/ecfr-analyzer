(a) Payment of indemnity claims will be contingent upon the availability of FSA funds to pay such claims. Claims will be, to the extent practicable within funding limits, paid from available funds, on a first-come, first-paid basis, based on the date FSA approves the application, until funds available in that fiscal year have been expended.


(b) DIPP claims received in a fiscal year after all available funds have been expended will not receive payment for such claims.
