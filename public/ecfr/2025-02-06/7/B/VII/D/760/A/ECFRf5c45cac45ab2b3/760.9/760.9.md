# ยง 760.9   Payments for the same loss.

(a) No indemnity payment shall be made for contaminated milk resulting from residues of chemicals or toxic substances if, within 30 days after receiving a complete application, the Deputy Administrator determines that other legal recouse is available to the farmer. An application shall not be deemed complete unless it contains all information necessary to make a determination as to whether other legal recourse is available to the farmer. However, notwithstanding such a determination, the Deputy Administrator may reopen the case at a later date and make a new determination on the merits of the case as may be just and equitable.

(c) For any affected farmer that exceeded 3 months of milk indemnity payments before December 13, 2021 no further payments for milk indemnity will be made for the same loss except as provided in ยง 760.3(b) and the affected farmer may apply for cow indemnity as specified in this subpart.


(d) An affected farmer that has an approved application for cow indemnity is no longer eligible for milk indemnity payments for the same loss.
