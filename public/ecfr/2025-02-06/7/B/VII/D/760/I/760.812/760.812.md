(a) Where available and determined accurate by FSA, RMA loss records will be used for insured crops.

(1) Retaining or providing, when required, the best verifiable or reliable production records available for the crop;


(2) Summarizing all the production evidence;


(3) Accounting for the total amount of unit production for the crop, whether or not records reflect this production;


(4) Providing the information in a manner that can be easily understood by the county committee; and


(5) Providing supporting documentation if the county committee has reason to question the damaging weather event or question whether all production has been accounted for.


(c) In determining production under this section, the participant must supply verifiable or reliable production records to substantiate production to the county committee.

If the eligible crop was farm-stored, sold, fed to livestock, or disposed of in means other than commercial channels, production records for these purposes include: truck scale tickets; appraisal information from a loss adjuster acceptable to FSA; contemporaneous diaries; or other documentary evidence, such as contemporaneous measurements.
