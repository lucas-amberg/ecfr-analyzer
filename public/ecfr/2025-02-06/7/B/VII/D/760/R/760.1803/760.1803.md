# § 760.1803   Participant eligibility.

(a) Participants will be eligible to receive a payment under this subpart only if they incurred a loss to an eligible crop due to a qualifying disaster event, as further specified in this subpart.


(b) To be an eligible participant under this subpart, a person or legal entity must be a:


(1) Citizen of the United States;


(2) Resident alien; for purposes of this subpart, resident alien means “lawful alien” (see § 1400.3 of this title);


(3) Partnership consisting solely of citizens of the United States or resident aliens; or


(4) Corporation, limited liability company, or other similar organizational structure organized under State law consisting solely of citizens or resident aliens of the United States.


(c) If any person who would otherwise be eligible to receive a payment dies before the payment is received, payment may be released as specified in § 707.3 of this chapter. Similarly, if any person or legal entity who would otherwise have been eligible to apply for a payment dies or is dissolved, respectively, before the payment is applied for, payment may be released in accordance with this subpart if a timely application is filed by an authorized representative. Proof of authority to sign for the deceased producer or dissolved entity must be provided. If a participant is now a dissolved general partnership or joint venture, all members of the general partnership or joint venture at the time of dissolution or their duly authorized representatives must sign the application. Eligibility of such participant will be determined, as it is for other participants, based upon ownership share and risk in producing the crop.


(d) An ownership share is required to be eligible for a payment under this subpart. Growers growing eligible crops under contract for crop owners are not eligible for a payment under this subpart unless the grower is also determined to have an ownership share of the crop. Any verbal or written contract that precludes the grower from having an ownership share renders the grower ineligible for payments under this subpart.


(e) A person or legal entity is not eligible to receive assistance under this subpart if FSA determines that the person or legal entity:


(1) Adopted any scheme or other device that tends to defeat the purpose of this subpart or any of the regulations applicable to this subpart;


(2) Made any fraudulent representation; or


(3) Misrepresented any fact affecting a program determination under any or all of the following: This subpart and parts 12, 400, 1400, and 1437 of this title.


(f) A person who is ineligible for crop insurance or NAP under § 400.458 or § 1437.16 of this title, respectively, for any year is ineligible for payments under this subpart for the same year.


(g) The provisions of § 718.11 of this chapter, providing for ineligibility for payments for offenses involving controlled substances, apply.


(h) As a condition of eligibility to receive payments under this subpart, the participant must have been in compliance with the Highly Erodible Land Conservation and Wetland Conservation provisions of part 12 of this title for the applicable crop year for which the producer is applying for benefits under this subpart, and must not otherwise be precluded from receiving payments under part 12, 400, 1400, or 1437 of this title or any law.
