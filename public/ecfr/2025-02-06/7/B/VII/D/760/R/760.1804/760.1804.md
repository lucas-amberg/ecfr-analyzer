# ยง 760.1804   Eligibility of affected production.

(a) To be eligible for the QLA Program, an eligible crop's affected production must have suffered a quality loss due to a qualifying disaster event and had at least a 5 percent quality loss due to all eligible disaster events. Whether affected production of a crop had a 5 percent loss will be determined separately for crops with different crop types, intended uses, certified organic or conventional status, county, and crop year.


(b) Affected production of the following is not eligible for the QLA Program:


(1) Crops that were not grown commercially;


(2) Crops that were intended for grazing or were grazed;


(3) Crops not intended for harvest;


(4) Volunteer crops;


(5) Value loss crops;


(6) Maple sap;


(7) Honey;


(8) By-products resulting from processing or harvesting a crop, such as, but not limited to, cotton seed, peanut shells, wheat or oat straw, or corn stalks or stovers;


(9) First-year seeding for forage production;


(10) Immature fruit crops;


(11) Crops for which FCIC coverage or NAP coverage is unavailable;


(12) Multiple market crops for which the producer previously received a crop insurance indemnity or WHIP+ payment for a quality loss;


(13) Crops for which production used to calculate a crop insurance indemnity or WHIP+ payment was adjusted based on a comparison of the producer's sale price to FCIC established price;


(14) Crops that received a crop insurance indemnity, NAP payment, or WHIP+ payment based on the quantity of production that was considered unmarketable;


(15) Crops for which the producer previously received a crop insurance indemnity, NAP payment, or WHIP+ payment for which production was reported as salvage value or secondary use;


(16) Sugar beets for which a member of a cooperative processor received a payment through a cooperative agreement; and


(17) Crops that were destroyed.


(c) Only affected production from initial crop acreage will be eligible for a QLA Program payment, unless the provisions for subsequent crops in this section are met. All plantings of an annual or biennial crop are considered the same as a planting of an initial crop in tropical regions as defined in part 1437, subpart F, of this title.


(d) In cases where there is double cropped acreage, affected production of each crop may be eligible only if the specific crops are approved by the FSA State committee as eligible double cropping practices in accordance with procedures approved by the Deputy Administrator.


(e) Participants having affected production from multiple plantings may receive payments for each planting only if the planting meets the requirements of part 1437 of this title and all other provisions of this subpart are satisfied.
