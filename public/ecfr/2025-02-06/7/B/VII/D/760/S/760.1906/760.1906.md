# § 760.1906   Payment limitation and attribution.

(a) The payment limitation for ERP is determined by the person's or legal entity's average adjusted gross farm income (income from activities related to farming, ranching, or forestry). Specifically, if their average adjusted gross farm income is less than 75 percent of their average adjusted gross income (AGI) for the three taxable years preceding the most immediately preceding complete tax year, a person or legal entity, other than a joint venture or general partnership, cannot receive, directly or indirectly, more than $125,000 in payments for specialty crops and high value crops 
1 and $125,000 in payment for all other crops under:


(1) ERP Phase 1 for program year 2020 and ERP Phase 2 for program year 2020, combined; and


(2) ERP Phase 1 for program year 2021 and ERP Phase 2 for program year 2021, combined.


(b) If at least 75 percent of the person or legal entity's average AGI is derived from farming, ranching, or forestry related activities and the producer provides the required certification and documentation, as discussed below, the person or legal entity, other than a joint venture or general partnership, is eligible to receive, directly or indirectly, up to:


(1) $900,000 for specialty crops and high value crops combined for:


(i) ERP Phase 1 for program year 2020 and ERP Phase 2 for program year 2020, combined; and


(ii) ERP Phase 1 for program year 2021 and ERP Phase 2 for program year 2021, combined.; and


(2) $250,000 for all other crops for:


(i) ERP Phase 1 for program year 2020 and ERP Phase 2 for program year 2020, combined; and


(ii) ERP Phase 1 for program year 2021 and ERP Phase 2 for program year 2021, combined.


(c) The relevant tax years for establishing a producer's AGI and percentage derived from farming, ranching, or forestry related activities are:


(1) Years 2016, 2017, and 2018 for program year 2020; and


(2) Years 2017, 2018, and 2019 for program year 2021.


(d) To receive more than $125,000 in ERP payments, producers must submit form FSA-510, accompanied by a certification from a certified public accountant or attorney as to that person or legal entity's certification. If a producer requesting the increased payment limitation is a legal entity, all members of that entity must also complete form FSA-510 and provide the required certification according to the direct attribution provisions in 7 CFR 1400.105, “Attribution of Payments.” If a legal entity would be eligible for the increased payment limitation based on the legal entity's average AGI from farming, ranching, or forestry related activities but a member of that legal entity either does not complete a form FSA-510 and provide the required certification or is not eligible for the increased payment limitation, the payment to the legal entity will be reduced for the limitation applicable to the share of the ERP Phase 2 payment attributed to that member.


(e) If a producer files form FSA-510 and the accompanying certification after their ERP Phase 2 payment is issued but before the deadline announced by FSA, FSA will process the form FSA-510 and issue the additional payment amount if a maximum initial payment amount has not been reached.


(f) A payment made to a legal entity will be attributed to those members who have a direct or indirect ownership interest in the legal entity, unless the payment of the legal entity has been reduced by the proportionate ownership interest of the member due to that member's ineligibility. Attribution of payments made to legal entities will be tracked through four levels of ownership in legal entities as follows:


(1) First level of ownership: Any payment made to a legal entity that is owned in whole or in part by a person will be attributed to the person in an amount that represents the direct ownership interest in the first-level or payment legal entity;


(2) Second level of ownership: Any payment made to a first-level legal entity that is owned in whole or in part by another legal entity (referred to as a second-level legal entity) will be attributed to the second-level legal entity in proportion to the ownership of the second-level legal entity in the first-level legal entity; if the second-level legal entity is owned in whole or in part by a person, the amount of the payment made to the first-level legal entity will be attributed to the person in the amount that represents the indirect ownership in the first-level legal entity by the person;


(3) Third and fourth levels of ownership: Except as provided in the second-level ownership in paragraph (f)(2) of this section and in the fourth level of ownership in paragraph (f)(4) of this section, any payments made to a legal entity at the third and fourth levels of ownership will be attributed in the same manner as specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section; and


(4) Fourth-level of ownership: If the fourth level of ownership is that of a legal entity and not that of a person, a reduction in payment will be applied to the first-level or payment legal entity in the amount that represents the indirect ownership in the first-level or payment legal entity by the fourth-level legal entity.


(g) Payments made directly or indirectly to a person who is a minor child will not be combined with the earnings of the minor's parent or legal guardian.


(h) A producer that is a legal entity must provide the names, addresses, ownership share, and valid taxpayer identification numbers of the members holding an ownership interest in the legal entity. Payments to a legal entity will be reduced in proportion to a member's ownership share when a valid taxpayer identification number for a person or legal entity that holds a direct or indirect ownership interest, at the first through fourth levels of ownership in the business structure, is not provided to FSA.


(i) If an individual or legal entity is not eligible to receive ERP Phase 2 payments due to the individual or legal entity failing to satisfy payment eligibility provisions, the payment made either directly or indirectly to the individual or legal entity will be reduced to zero. The amount of the reduction for the direct payment to the producer will be commensurate with the direct or indirect ownership interest of the ineligible individual or ineligible legal entity.


(j) Like other programs administered by FSA, payments made to an Indian Tribe or Tribal organization, as defined in section 4(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 5304), will not be subject to payment limitation.
