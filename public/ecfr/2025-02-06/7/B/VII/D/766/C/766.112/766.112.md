# ยง 766.112   Additional security for restructured loans.

(a) If the borrower is delinquent prior to restructuring, an additional amount of security will be required, if available, to reach a 125 percent security margin when the Agency is servicing a loan, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. Total loan security in excess of what is needed to achieve a security margin of 125 percent will only be taken when it is not practicable to separate the security.


(b) The Agency will take the best lien obtainable on assets of the borrower and co-borrowers to meet the 125 percent security margin requirement, except that the following assets will not be considered available to meet this requirement:


(1) When taking a lien on an asset will prevent the borrower from obtaining credit from other sources;


(2) When an asset could have significant environmental problems or costs as described in part 799 of this chapter;


(3) When the Agency cannot obtain a valid lien;


(4) When an asset is subsistence livestock, cash, special collateral accounts the borrower uses for the farming operation, retirement accounts, education savings accounts, personal vehicles necessary for family living, household contents, or small equipment such as hand tools and lawn mowers; or


(5) When a contractor holds title to a livestock or crop enterprise, or the borrower manages the enterprise under a share lease or share agreement.
