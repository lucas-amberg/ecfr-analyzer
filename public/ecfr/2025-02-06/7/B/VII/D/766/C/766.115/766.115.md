(2) Obtain an independent appraisal within 90 days of the request for reconsideration or appeal request and completed in accordance with ยง 761.7 as part of the request or reconsideration or appeals process. The borrower must:


(i) Pay for this appraisal;


(ii) Choose which appraisal will be used in Agency calculations, if the difference between the two appraisals is five percent or less.


(3) Use the second appraisal completed under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to negotiate the Agency's appraisal.
