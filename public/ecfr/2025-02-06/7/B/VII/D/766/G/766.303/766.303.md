# ยง 766.303   Processing loan servicing requests from borrowers in bankruptcy.

(a) *Considering borrower requests for servicing.* Any request for servicing is the borrower's acknowledgment that the Agency will not interfere with any rights or protections under the Bankruptcy Code and its automatic stay provisions.


(b) *Borrowers with confirmed bankruptcy plans.* If a plan is confirmed before servicing and any appeal is completed under 7 CFR part 11, the Agency will complete the servicing or appeals process and may consent to a post-confirmation modification of the plan if it is consistent with the Bankruptcy Code and subpart C of this part, as appropriate.


(c) *Chapter 7 borrowers.* A borrower filing for bankruptcy under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code may not receive primary loan servicing unless the borrower reaffirms the entire FLP debt. A borrower who filed chapter 7 does not have to reaffirm the debt in order to be considered for homestead protection.
