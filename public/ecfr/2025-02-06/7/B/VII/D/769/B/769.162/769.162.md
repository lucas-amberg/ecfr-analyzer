# ยง 769.162   Security.

(a) *Loans to intermediaries.* Security pledged to the Agency by intermediaries must be sufficient to reasonably assure repayment of the loan, while taking into consideration the intermediary's financial condition, the intermediary's relending plan, and the intermediary's management ability. The Agency will require adequate security, as determined by the Agency, to fully secure the loan:


(1) Primary security for HPRP loan will consist of a pledge by the intermediary of all assets now or hereafter placed in the HPRP revolving loan fund, including cash and investments, notes receivable from ultimate recipients, and the intermediary's security interest in collateral pledged by ultimate recipients. A first lien in the intermediary's HPRP revolving loan fund account(s) will be accomplished by a deposit agreement. The deposit agreement with the depository bank will perfect the Agency's security interest in the intermediary's depository accounts. The deposit agreement must be approved by the Agency. The deposit agreement will not require the Agency's signature for withdrawals. The intermediary must use a depository bank that agrees to waive its offset and recoupment rights against the depository account and subordinate any liens it may have against the HPRP depository account in favor of the Agency;


(2) Additional security as needed, which includes, but is not limited to:


(i) Assignments of assessments, taxes, levies, or other sources of revenue as authorized by law;


(ii) Financial assets of the intermediary and its members; and


(ii) Capital assets or other property of the intermediary and its members.


(b) *Loans to the ultimate recipient.* The intermediary is responsible for obtaining adequate security for all loans made to ultimate recipients from the HPRP revolving loan funds as specified in the HPRP loan agreement and intermediary's relending plan. The Agency will only require concurrence with the intermediary's proposed security for a loan to an ultimate recipient from the HPRP revolving loan fund if the proposed security will also serve as security for an unrelated Agency loan.
