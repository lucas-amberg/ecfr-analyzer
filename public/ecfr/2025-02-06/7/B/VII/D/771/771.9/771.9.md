# ยง 771.9   Interest rates, terms, security requirements, and repayment.

(a) *Interest rate.* The interest rate will be fixed for the term of the loan. The rate will be established by FSA, based upon the cost of Government borrowing for instruments on terms similar to that of the loan requested. 


(b) *Term.* The loan term will be based upon the needs of the applicant to accomplish the objectives of the loan program as determined by FSA, but may not exceed 10 years.


(c) *Security requirements.* (1) Loans must be adequately secured as determined by FSA. FSA may require certain security, including but not limited to the following:


(i) Assignments of assessments, taxes, levies, or other sources of revenue as authorized by State law;


(ii) Investments and deposits of the applicant; and


(iii) Capital assets or other property of the applicant or its members.


(2) In those cases in which FSA and another lender will hold assignments of the same revenue as collateral, the other lender must agree to a prorated distribution of the assigned revenue. The distribution will be based upon the proportionate share of the applicant's debt the lender holds for the eradication zone from which the revenue is derived at the time of loan closing.


(d) *Repayment.* The applicant must demonstrate that income sources will be sufficient to meet the repayment requirements of the loan and pay operating expenses.
