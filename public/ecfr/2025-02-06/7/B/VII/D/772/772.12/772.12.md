# § 772.12   Graduation.

(a) *General.* This section only applies to Minor Program borrowers with promissory notes which contain provisions requiring graduation. 


(b) *Graduation reviews.* Borrowers shall provide current financial information when requested by the Agency or its representatives to conduct graduation reviews. 


(1) AMP loans shall be reviewed at least every two years. In the year to be reviewed, each borrower must submit, at a minimum, a year-end balance sheet and cash flow projection for the current year. 


(2) All IMP borrowers classified as “commercial” or “standard” by the agency must be reviewed at least every 2 years. In the year to be reviewed, each borrower must submit a year-end balance sheet, actual financial performance for the most recent year, and a projected budget for the current year. 


(c) *Criteria.* Borrowers must graduate from the Minor Programs as follows: 


(1) Borrowers with IMP loans that are classified as “commercial” or “standard” must apply for private financing within 30 days from the date the borrower is notified of lender interest, if an application is required by the lender. For good cause, the Agency may grant the borrower a reasonable amount of additional time to apply for refinancing. 


(2) Borrowers with AMP loans will be considered for graduation at least every two years or more frequently if the Agency determines that the borrower's financial condition has significantly improved.
