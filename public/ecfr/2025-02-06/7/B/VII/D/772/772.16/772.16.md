# ยง 772.16   Liquidation.

When the Agency determines that continued servicing will not accomplish the objectives of the loan and the delinquency or financial distress cannot be cured by the options in ยง 772.13, or the loan is in non-monetary default, the borrower will be encouraged to dispose of the Agency security voluntarily through sale or transfer and assumption in accordance with this part. If such a transfer or voluntary sale is not carried out, the loan will be liquidated according to 7 CFR part 766. For AMP loans, appeal rights under 7 CFR part 11 are provided in the notice of acceleration. For IMP loans, appeal rights must be exhausted before acceleration, and the notice of acceleration is not appealable.
