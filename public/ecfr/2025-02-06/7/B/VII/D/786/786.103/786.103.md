(b) A request for benefits under this part must be submitted on a completed DDAP-III application.

Any information entered on the application will be considered information from the applicant regardless of who entered the information on the application. All information provided is subject to verification by FSA. Refusal to allow FSA or any other agency of the Department of Agriculture to verify any information provided may result in a denial of eligibility. Furnishing the information is voluntary; however, without it program benefits will not be approved. Providing a false certification to the Government may be punishable by imprisonment, fines, and other penalties or sanctions.
