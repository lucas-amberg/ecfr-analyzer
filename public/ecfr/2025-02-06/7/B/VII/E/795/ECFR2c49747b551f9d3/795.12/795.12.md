(a) A minor child and his parents or guardian (or other person responsible for him) shall be considered as one person, except that the minor child may be considered as a separate person if such minor child is a producer on a farm in which the parents or guardian or other person responsible for him (including any entity in which the parents or guardian or other person responsible for him has a substantial interest, *i.e.*, more than a 20-percent interest) takes no part in the operation of the farm (including any activities as a custom farmer) and owns no interest in the farm or allotment or in any portion of the production on the farm, and if such minor child:


(1) Is represented by a court-appointed guardian who is required by law to make a separate accounting for the minor and ownership of the farm is vested in the minor, or


(2) Has established and maintains a different household from his parents or guardian and personally carries out the actual farming operations on the farm for which there is a separate accounting, or


(3) Has a farming operation resulting from his being the beneficiary of an irrevocable trust and ownership of the property is vested in the trust or the minor.


(b) A person shall be considered a minor until he reaches 18 years of age. Court proceedings conferring majority on a person under 18 years of age will not change such person's status as a minor for purposes of applying the regulations.
