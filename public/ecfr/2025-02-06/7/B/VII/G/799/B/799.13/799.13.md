(a) When FSA acts as the lead agency in a NEPA review as specified in 40 CFR 1501.5, FSA will:


(1) Coordinate its review with other appropriate Federal, State, and Tribal governments; and


(2) Request other agencies to act as cooperating agencies as specified in 40 CFR 1501.6, and defined in 40 CFR 1508.5, as early in the review process as possible.


(b) If FSA acts as a lead agency for a proposed action that affects more than one State, the NECM will designate one SEC to act as RAO.
