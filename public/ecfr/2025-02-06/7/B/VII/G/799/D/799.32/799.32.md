# ยง 799.32   Categorical exclusions requiring review with an ESW.

(a) Proposed actions listed in this section may be categorically excluded after completion of a review with an ESW to document that a proposed action does not involve extraordinary circumstances as specified in ยง 799.33.


(b) This section has two types of categorical exclusions, one without construction and ground disturbance and one with construction and ground disturbance that will require additional environmental review and consultation in most cases.


(c) Consultations under NHPA, ESA, and other relevant environmental mandates, may be required to document that no extraordinary circumstances exist.


(d) The following proposed actions are grouped into broader categories of similar types of proposed actions without ground disturbance. Those proposed actions that are similar in scope (purpose, intent, and breadth) and the potential significance of impacts to those listed in this section, but not specifically listed in this section, will be considered categorical exclusions in this category, unless it is determined that extraordinary circumstances exist, as specified in ยง 799.33:


(1) *Loan actions.* The following list includes categorical exclusions for proposed actions related to FSA loans:


(i) Farm storage and drying facility loans for added capacity;


(ii) Loans for livestock purchases;


(iii) Release of loan security for forestry purposes;


(iv) Reorganizing farm operations; and


(v) Replacement building loans;


(2) *Minor management, construction, or repair actions.* The following list includes categorical exclusions for minor construction or repair proposed actions:


(i) Minor construction, such as a small addition;


(ii) Drain tile replacement;


(iii) Erosion control measures;


(iv) Grading, leveling, shaping, and filling;


(v) Grassed waterway establishment;


(vi) Hillside ditches;


(vii) Land-clearing operations of no more than 15 acres, provided any amount of land involved in tree harvesting (without stump removal) is to be conducted on a sustainable basis and according to a Federal, State, Tribal, or other governmental unit approved forestry management plan;


(viii) Nutrient management;


(ix) Permanent establishment of a water source for wildlife (not livestock);


(x) Restoring and replacing property;


(xi) Soil and water development;


(xii) Spring development;


(xiii) Trough or tank installation; and


(xiv) Water harvesting catchment; and


(3) *Other FSA actions.* The following list includes categorical exclusions for other FSA proposed actions:


(i) Fence installation and replacement;


(ii) Fish stream improvement;


(iii) Grazing land mechanical treatment; and


(iv) Inventory property disposal or lease without protective easements or covenants (this proposed action, in particular, has the potential to cause effects to historic properties and therefore requires analysis under section 106 of NHPA (54 U.S.C. 306108), as well as under the ESA and wetland protection requirements).


(e) The following proposed actions are grouped into broader categories of similar types of proposed actions with ground disturbance, each of the listed proposed actions has the potential for extraordinary circumstances because they include construction or ground disturbance. Therefore, additional environmental review and consultation will be necessary in most cases. Those proposed actions that are similar in scope (purpose, intent, and breadth) and the potential significance of impacts to those listed in this section, but not specifically listed in this section, will be considered categorical exclusions in this category, unless it is determined that extraordinary circumstances exist, as specified in ยง 799.33:

(i) Loans and loan subordination with construction, demolition, or ground disturbance planned;


(ii) Real estate purchase loans with new ground disturbance planned; and
