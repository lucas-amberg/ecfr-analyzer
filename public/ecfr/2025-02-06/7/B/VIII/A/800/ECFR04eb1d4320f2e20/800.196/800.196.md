(h) *Termination and renewal*—(1) *Triennial*—(i) *Termination.* A designation shall terminate at a time specified by the Administrator, but not later than 5 years after the effective date of the designation. A notice of termination shall be issued by the Service to a designated agency at least 120 calendar days in advance of the termination date. The notice shall provide instructions for requesting renewal of the designation. Failure to receive a notice from the Service shall not exempt a designated agency from the responsibility of having its designation renewed on or before the specified termination date.




(ii) *Renewal.* Designations may be renewed, upon application, in accordance with criteria and procedures for designation prescribed in section 7(f) of the Act and this section of the regulations. The Administrator may decline to renew a designation if:

(B) The Administrator determines that another qualified applicant is better able to provide official services in the assigned area.


(2) *Automatic termination.* Failure to pay the user fees prescribed by the Service for supervisory costs related to official inspection and weighing services within 30 days after due shall result in the automatic termination of the designation. The designation shall be reinstated if fees currently due, plus interest and any further expenses incurred by the Service because of the termination, are paid within 60 days after the termination.


(3) *Voluntary cancellation.* An agency may request that its designation be canceled by giving 90 days written notice to the Service.


(4) *Suspension or revocation of designation.* (i) *General.* A designation is subject to suspension or revocation, under section 7(g)(3) of the Act, by the Service, whenever the Administrator determines that: 


(A) The agency has failed to meet one or more of the criteria specified in section 7(f) of the Act or the regulations for the performance of official functions, or otherwise has not complied with any provision of the Act, regulations, or instructions, or 


(B) Has been convicted of any violation of other Federal law involving the handling or official inspection of grain.


(ii) *Summary suspension.* The Service may, without first affording the agency (hereafter referred to in this paragraph as the “respondent”) an opportunity for a hearing, suspend a designation or refuse to reinstate a designation when the suspension period has expired, pending final determination of the proceeding whenever the Service has reason to believe there is cause for revocation of the designation and considers such action to be in the best interest of the official inspection and weighing system. A suspension or refusal to reinstate a suspended designation shall be effective upon the respondent's receipt of a notice from the Service. Within 30 calendar days following the issuance of a notice of such action, the Service shall afford the respondent an opportunity for a hearing under paragraph (h)(4)(iii) of this section. The Service may terminate the action if it finds that alternative managerial, staffing, financial, or operational arrangements satisfactory to the Service can be and are made by the respondent.


(iii) *Other than summary suspension.* Except as provided in paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of the section, before the Service revokes or suspends a designation, the respondent shall be: (A) Notified by the Service of the proposed action and the reason(s) therefor, and (B) afforded an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with the Rules of Practice Governing Formal Adjudicatory Proceedings Instituted by the Secretary Under Various Statutes (7 CFR part 1, subpart H). Before initiating formal adjudicatory proceedings, the Service may, at its discretion, afford the respondent an opportunity to present its views on the proposed action and the reason(s) therefor in an informal conference. If, as a result of the informal conference, a consent agreement is reached, no formal adjudicatory proceedings shall be initiated.


(i) *Provision of services following suspension or termination.* If the designation of an agency is suspended, terminated, or the renewal of a designation is not granted, the Service shall attempt, upon a finding of need, to arrange for a replacement agency. If a qualified replacement agency cannot be designated on a timely basis, a qualified agency, if available, shall be designated on an interim basis. If a qualified agency is not available on an interim basis, the Service shall provide needed services on an interim basis.
