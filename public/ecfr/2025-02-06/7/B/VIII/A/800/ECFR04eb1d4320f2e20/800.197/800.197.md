# § 800.197   Approval as a scale testing and certification organization.

(a) *Who may apply.* Any State, local government, or person may request approval to perform scale testing and certification under the Act.


(b) *When and how to apply.* A request for approval to perform scale testing and certification under the Act should be filed with the Service not less than 90 calendar days before the requested action's effective date. A request for approval to perform scale testing and certification shall: 


(1) Show or be accompanied by documents which show all information required by the Service; 


(2) Certify that each employee scheduled to perform official scale testing and certification services is competent to test weighing equipment and has a working knowledge of the regulations and instructions applicable to such services; 


(3) Be accompanied by the fee prescribed in § 800.71; and


(4) Be signed by the applicant or its chief operating officer.


(c) *Review of applicant.* The review of an applicant for authority to perform scale testing and certification shall include an evaluation of the applicant's policies and procedures for testing and certifying scales for Class X and Class Y weighing.


(d) *Termination*—(1) *Voluntary.* A scale testing and certification organization may request cancellation of its approval by notifying the Service.


(2) *Suspension or revocation of approval*—(i) *General.* An approval is subject to suspension or revocation whenever the Administrator determines that the approved organization has violated any provision of the Act or regulations, or has been convicted of any violation involving the handling, weighing, or inspection of grain under Title 18 of the United States Code.


(ii) *Summary suspension.* The Service may, without first affording the organization an opportunity for a hearing, suspend an approval or refuse to reinstate an approval when the suspension period has expired, pending final determination of the proceeding whenever the Service has reason to believe there is cause for revocation of the approval and considers such action to be in the best interest of the official weighing system. A suspension or refusal to reinstate a suspended approval shall be effective when the organization receives a notice from the Service. Within 30 calendar days following the issuance of a notice of such action, the Service shall give the organization an opportunity for a hearing under paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section. The Service may terminate its action if it finds that alternative managerial, staffing, or operational arrangements satisfactory to the Service can be and are made by the organization.


(iii) *Other than summary suspension.* Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, before the Service revokes or suspends an approval, the organization shall be notified by the Service of the proposed action and the reason(s) therefor and shall be given an opportunity for a hearing. Before the Service initiates a hearing, it may, at its discretion, give the organization an opportunity to present its views on the proposed action and the reason(s) therefor in an informal conference. If a consent agreement is reached during the informal conference, no formal adjudicatory proceedings shall be initiated.
