# § 800.126   How to request reinspection or review of weighing services.

(a) *General.* Requests shall be made with the agency or field office that performed the original service. All requests shall include the information specified in § 800.46. Verbal requests shall be confirmed in writing when requested by official personnel. Copies of request forms may be obtained from the agency or field office. If at the time the request is filed the documentation required by § 800.46 is not available, official personnel may, at their discretion, withhold services pending the receipt of the required documentation. A reinspection certificate or the results of a review of weighing service shall not be issued unless (1) the documentation requested under § 800.46 has been submitted or (2) official personnel determine sufficient information has been made available so as to perform the requested service. A record that sufficient information was made available shall be included in the record of the official service.


(b) *Request requirements.* Requests will be considered filed on the date they are received by official personnel. A record shall be maintained for all requests.


(1) *Reinspection services.* Requests shall be received (i) before the grain has left the specified service point where the grain was located when the original inspection was performed; (ii) no later than the close of business on the second business day following the date of the original inspection; and (iii) before the identity of the grain has been lost. If a representative file sample, as prescribed in § 800.82, is available, official personnel may waive the requirements pursuant to this subparagraph. The requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section may be waived only upon written consent of the applicant and all interested persons. The requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section may be waived at the request of the applicant or other interested persons. The requirement of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section may also be waived upon satisfactory showing by an interested person of evidence of fraud or that because of distance or other good cause, the time allowed for filing was not sufficient. A record of each waiver shall be included in the record of the reinspection service.


(2) *Review of weighing services.* Requests shall be received no later than 90 calendar days after the date of the original Class X or Class Y weighing service.
