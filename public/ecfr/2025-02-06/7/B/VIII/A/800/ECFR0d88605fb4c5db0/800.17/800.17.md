(b) *Services at time of loading.* When official sampling, official inspection, Class X weighing or checkweighing, and checkloading of sacked export grain loaded aboard an export carrier is performed at one location and time, official export inspection and weight certificate(s) which identify the export carrier shall be issued.


(c) *Services prior to loading.* When official sampling, official inspection, and Class X weighing or checkweighing of sacked export grain is performed prior to the date of loading aboard an export carrier, official “OUT” certificates shall be issued. An examination by official personnel for condition and checkloading of the grain shall be made as the grain is loaded aboard the export carrier.
