# § 800.179   Refusal of renewal, suspension, or revocation of licenses for cause.

(a) *General.* A license may be suspended or revoked or may be refused renewal or return (if suspended) for causes prescribed in section 9 of the Act.


(b) *Procedure for summary action.* Under section 9 of the Act, any license may, without first affording the licensee (hereafter in this section the “respondent”) an opportunity for a hearing, be summarily suspended pending final determination, whenever the action is considered to be in the best interest of the official inspection system. Such action shall be effective upon receipt of notice from the Service by the respondent. Within 30 calendar days after issuing a notice of summary action, the Service shall afford the respondent an opportunity for a hearing as provided under paragraph (c) of this section. Pending final determination, the Service may terminate the action if alternative employment arrangements satisfactory to the Service can be and are made for the respondent by the employer of the respondent.


(c) *Procedure for other than summary action.* Except as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, before the Service refuses to renew, or suspends or revokes a license, or refuses to return a suspended license, the respondent shall be (1) notified of the proposed action and the reasons therefor, and (2) afforded (i) an opportunity to express his/her views on the proposed action in an informal manner, or (ii) at the request of the respondent, a hearing in accordance with the provisions of the Rules of Practice Governing Formal Adjudicatory Proceedings Instituted by the Secretary under Various Statutes (7 CFR, part 1, subpart H).
