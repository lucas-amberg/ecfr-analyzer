# § 800.156   Official inspection records.

(a) *Pan tickets.* The record for each kind of official inspection service identified in § 800.76 shall, in addition to the official certificate, consist of one or more pan tickets as prescribed in the instructions. Activities that are performed as a series during the course of an inspection service may be recorded on one pan ticket or on separate pan tickets. The original copy of each pan ticket shall be retained by the agency or field office that performed the inspection.


(b) *Inspection logs.* The record of an official inspection service for grain in a combined lot and shiplot shall include the official inspection log as prescribed in the instructions. The original copy of each inspection log shall be retained by the agency or field office that performed the inspection. If the inspection is performed by an agency, one copy of the inspection log shall be promptly sent to the appropriate field office.


(c) *Other forms.* Any detailed test that cannot be completely recorded on a pan ticket or an inspection log shall be recorded on other forms prescribed in the instructions. If the space on a pan ticket or an inspection log does not permit showing the full name for an official factor or an official criteria, an approved abbreviation may be used.


(d) *File samples*—(1) *General.* The record for an official inspection service based, in whole or in part, on an examination of a grain in a sample shall include one or more file samples as prescribed in the instructions.


(2) *Size.* Each file sample shall consist of an unworked portion of the official sample or warehouseman's sample obtained from the lot of grain and shall be large enough to permit a reinspection, appeal inspection, or Board appeal inspection for the kind and scope of inspection for which the sample was obtained. In the case of a submitted sample inspection, if an undersized sample is received, the entire sample shall be retained.


(3) *Method.* Each file sample shall be retained in a manner that will preserve the representativeness of the sample from the time it is obtained or received by the agency or field office until it is discarded. High moisture samples, infested samples, and other problem samples shall be retained according to the instructions.


(4) *Uniform system.* To facilitate the use of file samples, agencies shall establish and maintain a uniform file sample system according to the instructions.


(5) *Forwarding samples.* Upon request by the supervising field office or the Board of Appeals and Review, each agency shall furnish file samples (i) for field appeal or Board appeal inspection service, or (ii) for monitoring or supervision. If, at the request of the Service, an agency locates and forwards a file sample for an appeal inspection, the agency may, upon request, be reimbursed at the rate prescribed in § 800.71 by the Service.
