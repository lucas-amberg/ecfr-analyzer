Each determination of class, damaged kernels, heat-damaged kernels, waxy corn, flint corn, and flint and dent corn is made on the basis of the grain after the removal of the broken corn and foreign material. Other determinations not specifically provided for under the general provisions are made on the basis of the grain as a whole, except the determination of odor is made on either the basis of the grain as a whole or the grain when free from broken corn and foreign material.
