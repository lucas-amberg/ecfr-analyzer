# ยง 810.1403   Basis of determination.

Each determination of broken kernels and foreign material is made on the basis of the grain when free from dockage. Each determination of class, damaged kernels, heat-damaged kernels, and stones is made on the basis of the grain when free from dockage and that portion of the broken kernels, and foreign material that will pass through a 1.98 mm (5/64 inches) triangular-hole sieve. Other determinations not specifically provided for in the general provisions are made on the basis of the grain as a whole except the determination of odor is made on either the basis of the grain as a whole or the grain when free from dockage, broken kernels, and foreign material removed by the 1.98 mm (5/64 inches) triangular-hole sieve.
