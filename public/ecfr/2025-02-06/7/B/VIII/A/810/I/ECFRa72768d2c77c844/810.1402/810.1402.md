# § 810.1402   Definition of other terms.

(a) *Broken kernels.* All matter which passes through a 5/64 triangular-hole sieve and over a 2-1/2/64 round-hole sieve according to procedures prescribed in FGIS instructions.


(b) *Broken kernels and foreign material.* The combination of broken kernels and foreign material as defined in paragraph (a) and (f) of this section.


(c) *Classes.* There are four classes of sorghum: Sorghum, Tannin sorghum, White sorghum, and Mixed sorghum.


(1) *Sorghum.* Sorghum which lacks a pigmented testa (subcoat) and contains less than 98.0 percent White sorghum and not more than 3.0 percent Tannin sorghum. The pericarp color of this class may appear white, yellow, red, pink, orange or bronze.


(2) *Tannin sorghum.* Sorghum which has a pigmented testa (subcoat) and contains not more than 10 percent of kernels without a pigmented testa.


(3) *White sorghum.* Sorghum which lacks a pigmented testa (subcoat) and contains not less than 98.0 percent kernels with a white pericarp, and contains not more than 2.0 percent of sorghum of other classes. This class includes sorghum containing spots that, singly or in combination, cover 25.0 percent or less of the kernel.


(4) *Mixed sorghum.* Sorghum which does not meet the requirements for any of the classes Sorghum, Tannin sorghum, or White sorghum.


(d) *Damaged kernels.* Kernels, pieces of sorghum kernels and other grains that are badly ground damaged, badly weather damaged, diseased, frost-damaged, germ-damaged, heat-damaged, insect-bored, mold-damaged, sprout-damaged, or otherwise materially damaged.


(e) *Dockage.* All matter other than sorghum that can be removed from the original sample by use of an approved device according to procedures prescribed in FGIS instructions. Also, underdeveloped, shriveled, and small pieces of sorghum kernels removed in properly separating the material other than sorghum.


(f) *Foreign material.* All matter, except sorghum, which passes over the number 6 riddle and all matter other than sorghum that remains on top of the 5/64 triangular-hole sieve according to procedures prescribed in FGIS instructions.


(g) *Heat-damaged kernels.* Kernels, pieces of sorghum kernels, and other grains that are materially discolored and damaged by heat.


(h) *Nongrain sorghum.* Seeds of broomcorn, Johnson-grass, *Sorghum almum* Parodi, and sudangrass; and seeds of Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench that appear atypical of grain sorghum.


(i) *Pericarp.* The pericarp is the outer layers of the sorghum grain and is fused to the seedcoat.


(j) *Sieves*—(1) *1.98 mm (5/64 (0.0781) inches) triangular-hole sieve.* A metal sieve 0.81 mm (0.032 inches) thick with equilateral triangular perforations the inscribed circles of which are 1.98 mm (0.0781 inches) in diameter.


(2) *0.99 mm (2 1/2 /64 (0.0391) inches) round-hole sieve.* A metal sieve 0.81 mm (0.032 inch) thick with round holes 0.99 mm (0.0391 inches) in diameter.
