If all required documentation is not available when the request is made, it shall be provided as soon as it is available. At their discretion, official personnel may withhold inspection service pending receipt of the required documentation.


(b) *Request requirements.* Requests for original inspection service, other than submitted sample inspections, must be made with the cooperator or the Service responsible for the area in which the service will be provided.
