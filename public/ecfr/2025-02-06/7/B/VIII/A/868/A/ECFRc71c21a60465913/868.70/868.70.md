# § 868.70   Official certificates; issuance and distribution.

(a) *Required issuance.* An inspection certificate shall be issued to show the results of each kind and each level of inspection service.


(b) *Distribution*—(1) *Original.* The original and one copy of each inspection certificate shall be distributed to the applicant or the applicant's order. In addition, one copy of each inspection certificate shall be filed with the office providing the inspection; and, if the inspection is performed by a cooperator, one copy shall be forwarded to the appropriate field office. If requested by the applicant prior to issuance of the inspection certificate, additional copies not to exceed a total of three copies will be furnished at no extra charge.


(2) *Retest and appeal inspection service.* In addition to the distribution requirements in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, one copy of each retest or appeal inspection certificate will be distributed to each interested person of record or the interested person's order and to the cooperator or field office that issued the superseded certificate.


(3) *Additional copies.* Additional copies of certificates will be furnished to the applicant or interested person upon request. Fees for extra copies in excess of three may be assessed according to the fee schedules established by the cooperator or the Service.


(c) *Prompt issuance.* An inspection certificate shall be issued before the close of business on the business day following the date the inspection is completed.


(d) *Who may issue a certificate*—(1) *Authority.* Certificates for inspection services may be issued only by official personnel who are specifically authorized or licensed to perform and certify the results reported on the certificate.


(2) *Exception.* The person in the best position to know whether the service was performed in an approved manner and that the determinations are accurate and true should issue the certificate. If the inspection is performed by one person, the certificate should be issued by that person. If an inspection is performed by two or more persons, the certificate should be issued by the person who makes the majority of the determinations or the person who makes the final determination. Supervisory personnel may issue a certificate when the individual is licensed or authorized to perform the inspection being certificated.


(e) *Name requirement.* The name or the signature, or both, of the person who issued the inspection certificate shall be shown on the original and all copies of the certificate.


(f) *Authorization to affix names*—(1) *Requirements.* The names or the signatures, or both, of official personnel may be affixed to official certificates which are prepared from work records signed or initialed by the person whose name will be shown. The agent affixing the name or signature, or both, shall: (i) Be employed by a cooperating agency or the Service, (ii) have been designated to affix names or signatures, or both, and (iii) hold a power of attorney from the person whose name or signature, or both, will be affixed. The power of attorney shall be on file with the employing cooperating agency or the Service as appropriate.


(2) *Initialing.* When a name or signature, or both, is affixed by an authorized agent, the initials of the agent shall appear directly below or following the name or signature of the person.


(g) *Advance information.* Upon request, the contents of an official certificate may be furnished in advance to the applicant and any other interested person, or to their order, and any additional expense shall be borne by the requesting party.


(h) *Certification; when prohibited.* An official certificate shall not be issued for service after the request for an inspection service has been withdrawn or dismissed.
