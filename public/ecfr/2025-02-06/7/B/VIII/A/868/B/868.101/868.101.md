The Agricultural Marketing Service, (AMS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) facilitates the fair and efficient marketing of agricultural products by maintaining voluntary grade standards for Beans, Whole Dry Peas, Split Peas, and Lentils, which provide a uniform language for describing the quality of these commodities in the marketplace. These standards may cover (but are not limited to) terms, classes, quality levels, performance criteria, and inspection requirements. Procedures contained in this part set forth the process which AMS will follow in developing, issuing, revising, suspending, or terminating the U.S. standards for Beans, Whole Dry Peas, Split Peas, and Lentils. Communications about AMS standards in general should be addressed to the Administrator, AMS, USDA, 1400 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20250-3601.
