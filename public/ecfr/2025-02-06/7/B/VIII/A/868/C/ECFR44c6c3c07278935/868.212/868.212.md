# § 868.212   Special grades and requirements.

A special grade, when applicable, is supplemental to the grade assigned under § 868.210. Such special grades for rough rice are established and determined as follows:


(a) *Infested rough rice.* Tolerances for live insects for infested rough rice are defined according to sampling designations as follows:


(1) *Representative sample.* The representative sample consists of the work portion, and the file sample if needed and when available. The rough rice (except when examined according to paragraph (a)(3) of this section will be considered infested if the representative sample contains two or more live weevils, or one live weevil and one or more other live insects injurious to stored rice or five or more other live insects injurious to stored rice.


(2) *Lot as a whole (stationary).* The lot as a whole is considered infested when two or more live weevils, or one live weevil and one or more other live insects injurious to stored rice, or five or more other live insects injurious to stored rice, or 15 or more live Angoumois moths or other live moths injurious to stored rice are found in, on, or about the lot.


(3) *Sample as a whole during continuous loading/unloading.* The minimum sample size for rice being sampled during continuous loading/unloading is 500 grams per each 100,000 pounds of rice. The sample as a whole is considered infested when a component (as defined in FGIS instructions) contains two or more live weevils, or one live weevil and one or more other live insects injurious to stored rice, or five or more other live insects injurious to stored rice.


(b) *Parboiled rough rice.* Parboiled rough rice shall be rough rice in which the starch has been gelatinized by soaking, steaming, and drying. Grades U.S. No. 1 to U.S. No. 6 inclusive, shall contain not more than 10.0 percent of ungelatinized kernels. Grades U.S. No. 1 and U.S. No. 2 shall contain not more than 0.1 percent, grades U.S. No. 3 and U.S. No. 4 not more than 0.2 percent, and grades U.S. No. 5 and U.S. No. 6 not more than 0.5 percent of nonparboiled rice. If the rice is: (1) Not distinctly colored by the parboiling process, it shall be considered “Parboiled Light”; (2) distinctly but not materially colored by the parboiling process, it shall be considered “Parboiled”; (3) materially colored by the parboiling process, it shall be considered “Parboiled Dark.” The color levels for “Parboiled Light,” “Parboiled,” and “Parboiled Dark” rice shall be in accordance with the interpretive line samples for parboiled rice.


(c) *Smutty rough rice.* Smutty rough rice shall be rough rice which contains more than 3.0 percent of smutty kernels.


(d) *Glutinous rough rice.* Glutinous rough rice shall be special varieties of rice (Oryza sativa L. glutinosa) which contain more than 50 percent chalky kernels. Grade U.S. No. 1 shall contain not more than 1.0 percent of nonchalky kernels, grade U.S. No. 2 not more than 2.0 percent of nonchalky kernels, grade U.S. No. 3 not more than 4.0 percent of nonchalky kernels, grade U.S. No. 4 not more than 6.0 percent of nonchalky kernels, grade U.S. No. 5 not more than 10.0 percent of nonchalky kernels, and grade U.S. No. 6 not more than 15.0 percent of nonchalky kernels.


(e) *Aromatic rough rice.* Aromatic rough rice shall be special varieties of rice (Oryza sativa L. scented) that have a distinctive and characteristic aroma; e.g., basmati and jasmine rice.
