# § 1000.43   General classification rules.

In determining the classification of producer milk pursuant to § 1000.44, the following rules shall apply:


(a) Each month the market administrator shall correct for mathematical and other obvious errors all reports filed pursuant to § __.30 of each Federal milk order and shall compute separately for each pool plant, for each handler described in § 1000.9(c) and § 1135.11 of this chapter, the pounds of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in each class in accordance with §§ 1000.40 and 1000.42, and paragraph (b) of this section.


(b) *Shrinkage and Overage.* For purposes of classifying all milk reported by a handler pursuant to § __.30 of each Federal milk order the market administrator shall determine the shrinkage or overage of skim milk and butterfat for each pool plant and each handler described in § 1000.9(c) and § 1135.11 of this chapter by subtracting total utilization from total receipts. Any positive difference shall be shrinkage, and any negative difference shall be overage.


(1) Shrinkage incurred by pool plants qualified pursuant to § __.7 of any Federal milk order shall be assigned to the lowest-priced class to the extent that such shrinkage does not exceed:


(i) Two percent of the total quantity of milk physically received at the plant directly from producers' farms on the basis of farm weights and tests;


(ii) Plus 1.5 percent of the quantity of bulk milk physically received on a basis other than farm weights and tests, excluding concentrated milk received by agreement for other than Class I use;


(iii) Plus .5 percent of the quantity of milk diverted by the plant operator to another plant on a basis other than farm weights and tests; and


(iv) Minus 1.5 percent of the quantity of bulk milk transferred to other plants, excluding concentrated milk transferred by agreement for other than Class I use.


(2) A handler described in § 1000.9(c) or § 1135.11 of this chapter that delivers milk to plants on a basis other than farm weights and tests shall receive a lowest-priced-class shrinkage allowance of .5 percent of the total quantity of such milk picked up at producers' farms.


(3) Shrinkage in excess of the amounts provided in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section shall be assigned to existing utilization in series starting with Class I. The shrinkage assigned pursuant to this paragraph shall be added to the handler's reported utilization and the result shall be known as the *gross utilization in each class.*

(c) If any of the water but none of the nonfat solids contained in the milk from which a product is made is removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by the handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be considered under this part as used or disposed of by the handler shall be an amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such product plus all of the water originally associated with such solids. If any of the nonfat solids contained in the milk from which a product is made are removed before the product is utilized or disposed of by the handler, the pounds of skim milk in such product that are to be considered under this part as used or disposed of by the handler shall be an amount equivalent to the nonfat milk solids contained in such product plus all of the water and nonfat solids originally associated with such solids determined on a protein equivalent basis.


(d) Skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of bulk concentrated fluid milk and nonfluid milk products that are reconstituted for fluid use shall be assigned to Class I use, up to the reconstituted portion of labeled reconstituted fluid milk products, on a pro rata basis (except for any Class I use of specific concentrated receipts that is established by the handler) prior to any assignments under § 1000.44. Any remaining skim milk and butterfat in concentrated receipts shall be assigned to uses under § 1000.44 on a pro rata basis, unless a specific use of such receipts is established by the handler.
