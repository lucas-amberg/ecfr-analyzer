(b) Plant shall not include:


(1) A separate building without stationary storage tanks that is used only as a reload point for transferring bulk milk from one tank truck to another or a separate building used only as a distribution point for storing packaged fluid milk products in transit for route disposition;


(2) An on-farm facility operated as part of a single dairy farm entity for the separation of cream and skim milk or the removal of water from milk; or


(3) Bulk reload points where milk is transferred from one tank truck to another while en route from dairy farmers' farms to a plant.
