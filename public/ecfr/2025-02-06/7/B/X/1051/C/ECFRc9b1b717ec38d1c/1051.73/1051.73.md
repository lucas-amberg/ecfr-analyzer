(c) *Payment for milk received from cooperative association pool plants or from cooperatives as handlers pursuant to § 1000.9(c).* On or before the day prior to the dates specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section (except as provided in § 1000.90), each handler who receives fluid milk products at its plant from a cooperative association in its capacity as the operator of a pool plant or who receives milk from a cooperative association in its capacity as a handler pursuant to § 1000.9(c), including the milk of producers who are not members of such association and who the market administrator determines have authorized the cooperative association to collect payment for their milk, shall pay the cooperative for such milk as follows:


(1) For bulk fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received from a cooperative association in its capacity as the operator of a pool plant and for milk received from a cooperative association in its capacity as a handler pursuant to § 1000.9(c) during the first 15 days of the month, at not less than the lowest announced class prices per hundredweight for the preceding month;


(2) For the total quantity of bulk fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received from a cooperative association in its capacity as the operator of a pool plant, at not less than the total value of such products received from the association's pool plants, as determined by multiplying the respective quantities assigned to each class under § 1000.44, as follows:


(i) The hundredweight of Class I skim milk times the Class I skim milk price for the month plus the pounds of Class I butterfat times the Class I butterfat price for the month. The Class I price to be used shall be that price effective at the location of the receiving plant;


(ii) The pounds of nonfat solids in Class II skim milk by the Class II nonfat solids price;

(vi) The pounds of protein in Class III milk times the protein price;


(vii) The pounds of other solids in Class III milk times the other solids price; and


(viii) Add together the amounts computed in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (vii) of this section and from that sum deduct any payment made pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and


(3) For the total quantity of milk received during the month from a cooperative association in its capacity as a handler under § 1000.9(c) as follows:

(d) *Handler underpayment proration.* If a handler has not received full payment from the market administrator pursuant to § 1051.72 by the payment date specified in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, the handler may reduce pro rata its payments to producers or to the cooperative association (with respect to receipts described in paragraph (b) of this section, prorating the underpayment to the volume of milk received from the cooperative association in proportion to the total milk received from producers by the handler), but not by more than the amount of the underpayment. The payments shall be completed on the next scheduled payment date after receipt of the balance due from the market administrator.


(e) *Payments to missing or deceased producers.* If a handler claims that a required payment to a producer cannot be made because the producer is deceased or cannot be located, or because the cooperative association or its lawful successor or assignee is no longer in existence, the payment shall be made to the producer-settlement fund, and in the event that the handler subsequently locates and pays the producer or a lawful claimant, or in the event that the handler no longer exists and a lawful claim is later established, the market administrator shall make the required payment from the producer-settlement fund to the handler or to the lawful claimant, as the case may be.


(f) *Producer payment record.* In making payments to producers pursuant to this section, each handler shall furnish each producer, except a producer whose milk was received from a cooperative association handler described in § 1000.9(a) or (c), a supporting statement in a form that may be retained by the recipient which shall show:
