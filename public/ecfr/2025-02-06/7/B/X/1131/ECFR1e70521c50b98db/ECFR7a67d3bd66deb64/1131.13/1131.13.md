# § 1131.13   Producer milk.

*Producer milk* means the skim milk (or the skim equivalent of components of skim milk) and butterfat in milk of a producer that is:


(a) Received by the operator of a pool plant directly from a producer or a handler described in § 1000.9(c). All milk received pursuant to this paragraph shall be priced at the location of the plant where it is first physically received;


(b) Received by a handler described in § 1000.9(c) in excess of the quantity delivered to pool plants;


(c) Diverted by a pool plant operator to another pool plant. Milk so diverted shall be priced at the location of the plant to which diverted; or


(d) Diverted by the operator of a pool plant or a cooperative association described in § 1000.9(c) to a nonpool plant, subject to the following conditions:


(1) Milk of a dairy farmer shall not be eligible for diversion unless at least one day's production of such dairy farmer is physically received at a pool plant during the month;


(2) The total quantity of milk diverted by a handler in any month shall not exceed 50 percent of the total producer milk caused by the handler to be received at pool plants and diverted;


(3) Diverted milk shall be priced at the location of the plant to which diverted;


(4) Any milk diverted in excess of the limits prescribed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall not be producer milk. If the diverting handler or cooperative association fails to designate the dairy farmers' deliveries that are not to be producer milk, no milk diverted by the handler or cooperative association during the month to a nonpool plant shall be producer milk. In the event some of the milk of any producer is determined not to be producer milk pursuant to this paragraph, other milk delivered by such producer as producer milk during the month will not be subject to § 1131.12(b)(5); and


(5) The delivery day requirement in paragraph (d)(1) of this section and diversion percentage in paragraph (d)(2) of this section may be increased or decreased by the market administrator if the market administrator finds that such revision is necessary to assure orderly marketing and efficient handling of milk in the marketing area. Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall investigate the need for the revision either on the market administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested persons if the request is made in writing at least 15 days prior to the month for which the requested revision is desired effective. If the investigation shows that a revision might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice stating that the revision is being considered and inviting written data, views, and arguments. Any decision to revise the delivery day requirement or the diversion percentage must be issued in writing at least one day before the effective date.


(e) Producer milk shall not include milk of a producer that is subject to a marketwide equalization pool under a milk classification and pricing plan under the authority of a State government.
