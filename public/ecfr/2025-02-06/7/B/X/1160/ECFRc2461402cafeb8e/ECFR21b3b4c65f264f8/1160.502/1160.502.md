(2) Carry out the obligations of the Board under any contract or agreements that it entered pursuant to §§ 1160.208 and 1160.209; 


(3) Account for all receipts and disbursements and deliver to any person designated by the Secretary all property on hand, together with all books and records of the Board and the trustees; and 


(4) At the request of the Secretary, execute such assignments or other instruments necessary or appropriate to vest in the Secretary's designee full title and right to all of the funds, property, and claims of the Board or the trustees. 


(c) The Secretary's designee shall be subject to the same obligations with respect to funds, property or claims transferred or delivered pursuant to this subpart as the Board and the trustees. 


(d) The Board, the trustees or the Secretary's designee shall deliver to the Secretary any residual funds not required to pay liquidation expenses, which funds may be used, to the extent practicable, to continue one or more of the promotion, research or nutrition education plans or projects authorized pursuant to this subpart.
