(a) *Fluid milk processor* means any person who processes and markets commercially fluid milk products in consumer-type packages in the United States (excluding fluid milk products delivered directly to the place of residence of a consumer), except that the term fluid milk processor shall not include in each of the respective fiscal periods those persons who process and market not more than 3,000,000 pounds of such fluid milk products during the representative month, which shall be the first month of the fiscal period.


(b) Any person who did not qualify as a fluid milk processor for a fiscal period because of the 3,000,000-pound limitation shall not later qualify as a fluid milk processor during that fiscal period even though the monthly volume limitation is later exceeded during that period. 


(c) Any person who qualified as a fluid milk processor for a fiscal period and whose monthly marketings of fluid milk products later become 3,000,000 pounds or less shall no longer qualify as a fluid milk processor during that fiscal period beginning with the month in which the marketings first dropped below the volume limitation. 


(d) For the purpose of determining qualification as a fluid milk processor, each processor of fluid milk products shall report for the representative month of each fiscal period the hundredweight of fluid milk products processed and marketed by the processor.
