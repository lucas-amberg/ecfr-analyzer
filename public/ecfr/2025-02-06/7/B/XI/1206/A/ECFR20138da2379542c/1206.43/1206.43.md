(a) Any first handler or importer of less than 500,000 pounds of mangos per calendar year may claim an exemption from the assessments required under ยง 1206.42. Mangos produced domestically and exported from the United States may annually claim an exemption from the assessments required under ยง 1206.42.






(b) A first handler or importer desiring an exemption shall apply to the Board, on a form provided by the Board, for a certificate of exemption.

An importer must certify that it will import less than 500,000 pounds of mangos for the fiscal period for which the exemption is claimed.




(c) Upon receipt of an application, the Board shall determine whether an exemption may be granted. The Board then will issue, if deemed appropriate, a certificate of exemption to each person who is eligible to receive one. It is the responsibility of these persons to retain a copy of the certificate of exemption.


(d) Importers who receive a certificate of exemption shall be eligible for reimbursement of assessments collected by Customs.
