This one-time late payment charge will be 5 percent of the assessments due before interest charges have accrued.


(b) In addition to the late payment charge, 1 percent per month interest on the outstanding balance, including any late payment and accrued interest, will be added to any accounts for which payment has not been received within 30 calendar days of the date when assessments are due.
