# ยง 1230.25   State association.

*State association* means the single organization of producers in a State that is organized under the laws of that State and is recognized by the chief executive officer of such State as representing such State's producers. If no such organization exists in a State as of January 1, 1986, the Secretary may recognize an organization that represents not fewer than 50 producers who market annually an aggregate of not less than 10 percent of the pounds of porcine animals marketed in such State. The Secretary may cease to recognize a State association and instead recognize another organization of producers in a State as that State's association if the Secretary determines either that a majority of the members of the existing State association are not producers or that a majority of the members of the other organization seeking recognition are producers and that such organization better represents the economic interests of producers.
