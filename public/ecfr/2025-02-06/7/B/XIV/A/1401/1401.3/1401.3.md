# ยง 1401.3   Payments to persons with outstanding CCC loans.

(a) Persons with outstanding CCC loans who are eligible to receive payments from CCC, including a person authorized to receive a payment on behalf of another person, may be required to liquidate such loans in accordance with this section in order to be eligible to receive a payment authorized by ยง 1470.2. 


(b) A person with an outstanding CCC loan must, unless otherwise agreed upon by the person and CCC, redeem and sell to CCC a quantity of the commodity pledged as collateral for a CCC loan, as determined by CCC, in an amount equal in value to the value of the payment which would otherwise be made to such person. If the person has more than one outstanding CCC loan, CCC may, by contract or otherwise, prescribe which loan collateral the person shall be required to redeem in order to receive payment. The purchase price shall be equal to the cost of liquidating the loan or the portion of the loan for which the quantity of the commodity sold to CCC is pledged as collateral, except that, in the case of a special producer storage loan or a farmer-owned reserve loan, the purchase price will not include the amount of any unearned advance storage payments received with respect to the redeemed collateral. After redemption and the subsequent sale to CCC of the commodity pledged as collateral for such CCC loan, CCC shall make available to the person a like quantity of the commodity.
