# ยง 1409.201   Applicability.

(a) This subpart specifies the process for eligible non-profit entities to receive commodities from the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) that CCC has acquired in response to trade actions taken by foreign governments resulting in the loss of exports. The types and quantities of commodities made available under this subpart, if any, is dependent upon the ability of CCC to use such commodities through existing domestic feeding programs administered by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS). In the event that these domestic feeding programs are unable to use the commodities acquired by CCC, EDCDP is intended to provide the remaining commodities to low income individuals, primarily through eligible entities not participating in existing FNS food distribution programs.


(b) CCC, as specified in the applicable Notice of Commodity Availability, will use grants and cooperative agreements to conduct the Expanded Domestic Commodity Donation Program (EDCDP).


(c) The Food and Nutrition Service and the Agricultural Marketing Service will administer the EDCDP on behalf of CCC.
