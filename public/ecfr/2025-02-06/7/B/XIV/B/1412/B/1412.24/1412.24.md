# ยง 1412.24   Limitation of total base acres on a farm.

(a) The sum of the following cannot exceed the total cropland acreage on the farm, plus approved double-cropped acreage for the farm:


(1) The sum of all base acres established for the farm in accordance with this part; plus


(2) Any cropland acreage on the farm enrolled in a CRP contract in accordance with part 1410 of this chapter; plus


(3) Any cropland acreage on the farm enrolled in a wetland reserve program contract in accordance with part 1467 of this chapter; plus


(4) Any other acreage on the farm enrolled in a Federal conservation program for which payments are made in exchange for not producing an agricultural commodity on the acreage.


(b) The Deputy Administrator will give the owner of the farm the opportunity to select the base acres against which any reduction required in this section will be made. Absent the owner selecting the base acres for reduction, FSA will apply a pro-rata reduction against the base acres before computing and issuing any payments for the program year when a reduction becomes necessary.


(c) In applying paragraph (a) of this section, FSA will take into account the practice of double cropping on a farm, as determined by FSA.


(d) For base acre reductions:


(1) Subject to the limitation in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a permanent reduction of all or a portion of a farm's base acres 

 will be allowed when all owners of the farm execute and submit a written request for such reduction, on a CCC-approved standard, uniform form designated by CCC, to the FSA county office where the records for the farm are administratively maintained.


(2) A permanent reduction of all or a portion of a farm's base acres to negate or reduce a program violation is not allowed.


(e) When base acres on a farm are converted to a non-agricultural commercial or industrial use, the total base acres on the farm will be reduced accordingly regardless of the submission of a request for such reduction.


(f) The base acres on a farm will be proportionately reduced when it is determined that the land has been subdivided and developed for multiple residential units or other nonfarming uses if, in the judgment of the county committee, the size of the tracts and the density of the subdivision is such that the land is unlikely to return to the previous agricultural use, unless either of the following applies:


(1) The producers on the farm demonstrate that the land remains devoted to commercial agricultural production or is likely to be returned to the previous agricultural use and such land has not been divided from the farm with a farm reconstitution performed according to part 718 of this title; or


(2) A properly constituted or reconstituted farm contains sufficient land that has not yet been subdivided and developed for multiple residential units or other nonfarming uses, and the producers on the farm demonstrate that the land remains devoted to commercial agricultural production or is likely to be returned to the previous agricultural use.
