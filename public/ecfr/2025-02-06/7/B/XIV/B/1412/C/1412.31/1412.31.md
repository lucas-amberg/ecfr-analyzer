# ยง 1412.31   PLC yields for covered commodities.

(a) Except for seed cotton PLC yield for covered commodities on the farm is equal to the counter-cyclical payment yield established for each covered commodity on the farm that was effective September 30, 2013, unless the PLC yield is updated as specified in ยง 1421.32. If the Secretary designates an additional oilseed or pulse crop as a covered commodity that does not have a counter-cyclical payment yield, the PLC yield for that commodity will be established as specified in ยง 1412.34.


(b) The PLC yield for seed cotton on the farm is equal to the counter-cyclical payment yield established for upland cotton on the farm as in effect September 30, 2013, times 2.4, unless the PLC yield is updated as specified in ยง 1421.33.


(c) If a PLC yield is not already established for a covered commodity on a farm for which base acres are allocated through the base acres reallocation process a yield will be established for the covered commodity on the farm using the yield on similarly situated farms, as determined by FSA. The yield on similarly situated farms will then be used as the 2013 county average counter-cyclical yield for the covered commodity.
