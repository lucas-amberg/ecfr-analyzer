# ยง 1412.36   Incorrect or false production evidence.

(a) If a certification of production and yield or production evidence submitted in support of that certification is false or incorrect, as determined by the county committee, the county committee will determine whether the owner, operator, or producer submitting the certification or production evidence for a farm acted in good faith or took action to defeat the purpose of ARC or PLC.


(b) If the county committee determines the owner or producer who submitted the certification or production evidence referenced in paragraph (a) of this section acted in good faith and did not take action to defeat the purpose of ARC or PLC, the county committee will, as applicable:


(1) Correct the PLC yield for the applicable covered commodity to equal the yield that would have been calculated as specified in ยง 1412.32 based on accurate production evidence; and


(2) Recalculate any payments based on the correct yield and require refunds of any payments that were issued as a result of the incorrect yield. Unearned payments must be refunded together with interest from the date of disbursement and are due from any producers who received payments that would not have issued absent the error or incorrect yield.


(c) If the county committee determines the owner, operator, or producer who submitted the false or incorrect evidence did not act in good faith or took any action to defeat or undermine the purpose of ARC or PLC, the county committee will require a full refund of any payments, with interest, that were issued to any persons based on that false or erroneous certification or production evidence and the yield update request is invalid.
