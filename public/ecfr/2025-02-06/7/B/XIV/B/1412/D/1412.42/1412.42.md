# § 1412.42   Eligible producers.

(a) Producers eligible to enter into a contract are:


(1) An owner of a farm who has an ownership share of a crop and who assumes all or a part of the risk of producing a crop that is commensurate with that claimed ownership share of the crop; or


(2) A producer, other than an owner, on a farm with a share-rent lease for such farm, regardless of the length of the lease, if the owner of the farm enters into the same contract; or


(3) A producer, other than an owner, on a farm who cash rents such farm under a lease expiring on or after September 30 of the year of the contract in which case the owner is not required to enter into the contract; or


(4) A producer, other than an owner, on a farm who cash rents such farm under a lease expiring before September 30 of the year of the contract. The owner of such farm must also enter into the same contract, failing which the farm is not enrolled; or


(5) An owner of an eligible farm who cash rents such farm and the lease term expires before September 30 of the year of the contract, if the tenant declines to enter into a contract for the applicable year. In the case of an owner covered by this paragraph, payments will not begin under the contract until the lease held by the tenant ends.


(b) A minor child will be eligible to enter into a contract only if one of the following conditions exist:


(1) The right of majority has been conferred upon the minor by court proceedings or law;


(2) A guardian has been appointed to manage the minor's property and the applicable program documents are executed by the guardian; or


(3) A bond is furnished under which a surety guarantees any loss incurred for which the minor would be liable had the minor been an adult.


(c) The owner of the farm may be considered the “producer” if there is no other producer, but the owner could have shared in the crop had a crop been produced, but only if the farm and owner otherwise meet all the requirements for payment.
