(a) Authorized farm storage is: 


(1) A storage structure located on or off the farm, (excluding public warehouses that do not enter into an agreement with CCC), that CCC determines to be controlled by the producer which affords safe storage of collateral pledged for a MAL; 


(2) If determined and announced to be available in a State or county, on ground storage and other temporary storage structures approved by CCC. 


(3) As determined by CCC, temporary authorized storage may also include: 


(i) On-ground storage or; 


(ii) Other storage arrangements. 


(b) CCC may reduce the quantity of a commodity pledged as collateral for a MAL made available under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to not more than 75 percent of such otherwise eligible quantity in order to protect the interests of CCC. CCC may also limit the length of time the commodity may be stored on-ground or in temporary structures to not more than 90 days. A MAL made with respect to such commodity that is not moved to a structure specified in (a)(2) within 90 days of the date the MAL was disbursed may be called by CCC.


(c)(1) Authorized warehouse storage consists of warehouses that:


(i) If Federally licensed, are in compliance with 7 CFR part 735 or


(ii) If not Federally licensed, are in compliance with State laws and that issue warehouse receipts that meet the criteria specified in ยง 1421.107.
