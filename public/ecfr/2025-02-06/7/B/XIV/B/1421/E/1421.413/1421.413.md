# ยง 1421.413   Liens and waivers.

(a) DMAs performing MAL-related functions pursuant to the authority in this subpart must determine, to the same extent as required for MALs handled by FSA county offices, whether a lien on the peanuts exists by performing or obtaining a lien search for all peanuts to be pledged for each MAL, except that the cost associated with such lien search and any necessary lien waivers is borne by the DMA. If a lien exists, the DMA must obtain, on an approved CCC form, a signed waiver from each lienholder with an interest in any such lien.


(b) [Reserved]
