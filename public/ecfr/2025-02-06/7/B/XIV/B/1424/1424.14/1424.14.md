(a) Any payment or portion thereof to any person shall be made without regard to questions of title under State law and without regard to any claim or lien against the bioenergy, or proceeds thereof, in favor of the owner or any other creditor except agencies of the U.S. Government. The regulations governing offsets and withholdings found in part 1403 of this chapter shall be applicable to agreement payments.

(d) CCC may waive the accrual of interest and/or damages if CCC determines that the cause of the erroneous determination was not due to any action of the bioenergy producer.
