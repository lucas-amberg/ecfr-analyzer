# ยง 1427.12   Liens.

(a) Waivers that fully protect the interest of CCC must be obtained before loan disbursement, notwithstanding provisions in ยง 1427.19(h), if there are any liens or encumbrances on the cotton tendered as collateral for a loan, even though the liens or encumbrances are satisfied from the loan proceeds, except that CCC may elect to waive such lien requirements for loans having a principal value of less than $50,000.


(b) CCC may elect to accept cotton as loan collateral that has warehouse receiving, compression, or other charges without a lien waiver if the producer at the time of loan application agrees to reimburse CCC for any such charges that CCC may pay on behalf of the producer or that reduce the value of the cotton delivered to CCC.
