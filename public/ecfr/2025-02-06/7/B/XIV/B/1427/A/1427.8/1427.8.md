(a) The loan rates for crops of upland cotton and ELS cotton will be determined and announced by CCC and made available at FSA State and county offices. 


(b) The quantity of cotton which may be pledged as collateral for a loan will be the net weight of the eligible cotton as shown on the warehouse receipt issued by an approved warehouse, except that in the case of a bale which has a net weight of more than 600 pounds, the weight to be used in determining the amount of the loan on the bale will be 600 pounds.

(d) CCC will not increase the amount of the loan made for any bale of cotton as a result of a redetermination of the quantity or quality of the bale after it is tendered to CCC, except that if it is established to the satisfaction of CCC that a bona fide error was made for the weight of the bale or the classification for the bale, such error may be corrected.
