# § 1430.302   Commencement and termination of DPDP purchases.

(a) DPDP purchases commence only if approved by the FSA Administrator under the provisions of this subpart.

(2) If the actual dairy production margin has been greater than $4 per cwt of milk for the immediately preceding month.


(3) If the actual dairy production margin has been $4 or less, but more than $3, per cwt for the immediately preceding month and during the same month —


(i) The price in the United States for cheddar cheese was more than 5 percent above the world price, or


(ii) The price in the United States for non-fat dry milk (NDM) was more than 5 percent above the world price of skim milk powder.


(4) If the actual dairy production margin has been $3 or less per cwt of milk for the immediately preceding month and during the same month —


(i) The price in the United States for cheddar cheese was more than 7 percent above the world price; or


(ii) The price in the United States for NDM was more than 7 percent above the world price of skim milk powder.


(c) Purchases will terminate beginning with the first day of any month that does not qualify for DPDP purchases.
