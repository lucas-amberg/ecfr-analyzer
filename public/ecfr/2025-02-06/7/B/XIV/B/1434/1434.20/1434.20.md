(a) Upon maturity and nonpayment of the loan, title to the unredeemed honey securing the loan will vest in CCC. 


(b) If the total amount due on a loan or the unpaid amount of the note and charges, plus interest is not satisfied upon maturity, CCC may remove the honey from storage and assign, transfer, and deliver the honey or documents evidencing title thereto at such time, in such manner, and upon such terms as CCC may determine at public or private sale. Any such disposition may also be effected without removing the honey from storage. The honey may be processed before sale and CCC may become the purchaser of the whole or any part of the honey at either a public or private sale. 


(1) If the value of the collateral computed at settlement is less than the amount due, the producer must pay to CCC the amount of such deficiency and charges, plus interest on such deficiency and CCC may take any action against the producer to recover the deficiency; or 


(2) If the proceeds received from the sale of the honey so computed are greater than the sum of the amount due plus any cost incurred by CCC in conducting the sale of the honey, such excess will be paid to the producer or, if applicable, to any secured creditor of the producer.
