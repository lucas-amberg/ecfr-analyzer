(4) If the transfers as specified under paragraphs (b)(2) or (3) of this section are not accomplished during the specified periods, FSA county committee will place the base into a pool for possible reassignment to other farms;


(5) After providing notice to farm owners, operators and growers of record in the county, the committee will accept requests from farm owners, operators, and growers in the county;


(6) The county committee will assign the base to other sugarcane farms in the county that are eligible and capable of accepting the acreage base, based on a random drawing among requests received under paragraph (b)(5) of this section;


(7) Any unassigned base will be made available to the State FSA committee and be allocated to remaining FSA county committees in the State representing counties with farms eligible for assignment of the base, based on a random drawing; and


(8) After the acreage base has been reassigned, the acreage base will remain on the farm and subject to the transfer provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.
