# § 1435.602   Eligible sugar to be purchased by CCC.

(a) CCC will only purchase raw sugar, refined sugar, or in-process sugar for FFP that is eligible to be used as collateral under the CCC Sugar Loan Program, as specified in § 1435.102.


(b) Raw sugar, refined sugar, or in-process sugar purchased directly from any domestic sugar beet or sugarcane processor that made the raw sugar, refined sugar, or in-process sugar will be credited against the processor's sugar marketing allocation. (The definition for “marketing” in § 1435.2 applies to this subpart.)


(c) CCC will only purchase sugar located in the United States.


(d) CCC will evaluate an offer to sell sugar to CCC based upon CCC's estimate of the reduction in refined sugar supply available for human consumption due to the purchase. For example, if processing thick juice (an in-process sugar) would yield 70 percent sugar for human consumption, then CCC will only consider 70 percent of the volume of the thick juice in evaluating the per unit sales price.


(e) CCC will only purchase the sugar if such purchase would reduce the likelihood of forfeitures of CCC sugar loans, as determined by CCC.
