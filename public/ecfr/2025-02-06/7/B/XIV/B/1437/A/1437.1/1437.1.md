(a) The purpose of the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) is to help manage and reduce production risks faced by producers of eligible commercial crops or other agricultural commodities during a coverage period. NAP reduces financial losses that occur when natural disasters (damaging weather or adverse natural occurrence that is an eligible cause of loss) cause a loss of expected production or actual value for value loss crops, or where producers are prevented from planting an eligible crop because of an eligible cause of loss in a coverage period.


(b) The provisions in this part are applicable to eligible producers and eligible crops for which catastrophic risk protection is not available under subsection (b) of section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1508) and additional coverage under subsections (c) and (h) of section 508 or, if coverage is available, it is only available under a policy that provides coverage for specific intervals based on weather indexes or under a whole farm plan of insurance.


(c) The regulations in this part are applicable to the 2019 and subsequent crop years.
