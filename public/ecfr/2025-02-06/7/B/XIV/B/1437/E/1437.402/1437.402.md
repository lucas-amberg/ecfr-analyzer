# ยง 1437.402   Carrying capacity.

(a) FSA will establish a carrying capacity for all grazed forage present in the county for purposes of administering this program and to that end: 


(1) Multiple carrying capacities may be determined for a specific vegetation if factors, such as soil type, elevation, and topography, result in a significant difference of carrying capacity within the county. 


(2) FSA may establish separate carrying capacities for irrigated and non-irrigated forage acreage when acreage of traditionally irrigated forage (forage actually irrigated 3 of the last 5 crop years) is present in the county. 


(b) Producers may provide evidence that unit forage management and maintenance practices are improvements over those practices generally associated with the established carrying capacity. Based on this evidence, FSA may adjust the expected AUD for the specific forage acreage with catastrophic coverage upward for the crop year NAP assistance is requested by: 


(1) Three percent when at least 1 practice was completed at least 1 time in the previous 5 crop years and such practice can be expected to have a positive impact on the forage's carrying capacity in the crop year NAP assistance is requested; 


(2) Five percent when 2 or more practices were completed at least 1 time in the previous 5 crop years and such practices can be expected to have a positive impact on the forage's carrying capacity in the crop year NAP assistance is requested; and 


(3) Greater than 5 percent when producers provide acceptable records, as determined by FSA, of higher forage production or an increase in animal units supported on the specific forage acreage in 3 of the 5 crop years immediately before the crop year NAP assistance is requested.
