# ยง 1464.46   Environmental credits for conservation improvements.

NRCS recognizes that environmental benefits will be achieved by implementing eligible activities funded through RCPP, and a participant may obtain environmental credits as a result of implementing additional eligible activities through an environmental service market if one of the purposes of the market is the facilitation of additional conservation benefits that are consistent with the purposes of a program contract or supplemental agreement. NRCS asserts no direct or indirect interest on these credits. However, NRCS retains the authority to ensure that operation and maintenance (O&M) requirements for RCPP-funded eligible activities are met. Where the non-RCPP funded additional eligible activities may impact the land under a program contract or supplemental agreement, producers and participants are highly encouraged to request an O&M compatibility determination from NRCS prior to entering into any environmental credit agreements.
