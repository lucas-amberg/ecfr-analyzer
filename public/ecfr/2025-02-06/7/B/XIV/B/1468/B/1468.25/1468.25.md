# § 1468.25   Agricultural land easement deeds.

(a) Under ACEP-ALE, a landowner grants an easement to an eligible entity with which NRCS has entered into an ALE-agreement. The easement deed will require that the easement area be maintained in accordance with ACEP-ALE goals and objectives for the term of the easement.


(b) The term of an agricultural land easement must be in perpetuity, except where State law prohibits a permanent easement. In such cases where State law limits the term of a conservation easement, the easement term will be for the maximum duration allowed under State law.


(c) The eligible entity may use its own terms and conditions in the agricultural land easement deed, but the agricultural land easement deed must provide for the effective administration, management, and enforcement of the agricultural land easement by the eligible entity or its successors and assigns and must address the deed requirements as specified by this part and by NRCS in the ALE-agreement.


(d) All deeds, as further specified in the ALE-agreement, must address the following regulatory deed requirements:


(1) Include a right of enforcement clause for NRCS. NRCS will specify the terms for the right of enforcement clause, including that such interest in the agricultural land easement:


(i) May be used only if the terms and conditions of the easement are not enforced by the eligible entity;


(ii) Extends to a right of inspection only if the holder of the easement fails to provide monitoring reports in a timely manner or NRCS has a reasonable and articulable belief that the terms and conditions of the easement have been violated;


(iii) Remains in effect for the duration of the easement and any changes that affect NRCS's interest in the agricultural land easement must be reviewed and approved by NRCS under § 1468.6 of this part.


(2) Specify that impervious surfaces will not exceed 2 percent of the ACEP-ALE easement area, excluding NRCS-approved conservation practices unless NRCS grants a waiver as follows:


(i) The eligible entity may request a waiver of the 2-percent impervious surface limitation at the time an individual parcel is approved for funding,


(ii) NRCS may waive the 2-percent impervious surface limitation on an individual easement basis, provided that no more than 10 percent of the easement area is covered by impervious surfaces,


(iii) Before waiving the 2 percent limitation, NRCS will consider, at a minimum, population density; the ratio of open, prime, and other important farmland versus impervious surfaces on the easement area; the impact to water quality concerns in the area; the type of agricultural operation; parcel size; and the purposes for which the easement is being acquired,


(iv) Eligible entities may submit an impervious surface limitation waiver process to NRCS for review and consideration. The eligible entities must apply any approved impervious surface limitation waiver processes on an individual easement basis, and


(v) NRCS will not approve blanket waivers or entity blanket waiver processes of the impervious surface limitation. All ACEP-ALE easements must include language limiting the extent of impervious surfaces within the easement area.


(3) Include an indemnification clause requiring the landowner to indemnify and hold harmless the United States from any liability arising from or related to the property enrolled in ACEP-ALE.


(4) Include clauses requiring that any changes to the easement deed or easement area made after easement recordation, including any amendment to the easement deed, any subordination of the terms of the easement*,* or any modifications, exchanges, or terminations of some or all of the easement area, must be consistent with the purposes of the agricultural land easement and this part and must be approved by NRCS and the easement holder in accordance with § 1468.6 prior to recordation or else the action is null and void.


(5) Prohibit commercial and industrial activities except those activities that NRCS has determined are consistent with the agricultural use of the land.


(6) Limit the subdivision of the property subject to the agricultural land easement, except where State or local regulations explicitly require subdivision to construct residences for employees working on the property or where otherwise authorized by NRCS.


(7) Prohibit subsurface mineral development unless the terms of the deed, as determined by NRCS, specify that any subsurface mineral development allowed by the eligible entity on the easement area must—


(i) Be conducted in accordance with applicable State law;


(ii) Have a limited and localized impact;


(iii) Not harm the agricultural use and conservation values of the land subject to the easement;


(iv) Not materially alter or affect the existing topography;


(v) Comply with a subsurface mineral development plan that includes a plan for the remediation of impacts to the agricultural use or conservation values of the land subject to the easement and is approved by NRCS prior to the initiation of mineral development activity;


(vi) Not be accomplished by any surface mining method;


(vii) Be within the impervious surface limits of the easement under paragraph (d)(2) of this section;


(viii) Use practices and technologies that minimize the duration and intensity of impacts to the agricultural use and conservation values of the land subject to the easement; and


(ix) Ensure that each area impacted by the subsurface mineral development are reclaimed and restored by the holder of the mineral rights at cessation of operation.


(8) Include specific protections related to the purposes for which the agricultural land easement is being acquired, including provisions to protect historical or archaeological resources or grasslands of special environmental significance.


(9) For parcels with highly erodible cropland, include terms that ensure compliance with the conservation plan that will be developed and managed in accordance with the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, and its associated regulations.


(10) Include any additional provisions needed to address the attributes for which a parcel was ranked and selected for funding by NRCS, such as the purchase of the agricultural land easement, the development and maintenance of an agricultural land easement plan, or use of the minimum deed terms as described in paragraph (f) of this section.


(11) Include terms, if required by the eligible entity, that identify an intent to keep the land subject to the agricultural land easement under ownership of a farmer or rancher.


(12) Include other minimum deed terms specified by NRCS to ensure that ACEP-ALE purposes are met.


(e) NRCS reserves the right to require additional specific language or require removal of language in the agricultural land easement deed to ensure the enforceability of the easement deed, protect the interests of the United States, or to otherwise ensure ALE purposes will be met.


(f) For eligible entities that have not been certified, the deed document must be reviewed and approved by NRCS in advance of use as provided herein:


(1) NRCS will make available for an eligible entity's use a standard set of minimum deed terms that satisfactorily address the deed requirements in paragraph (d) of this section and may be wholly incorporated along with the eligible entity's own deed terms into the agricultural land easement deed, or as an addendum that is attached and incorporated by reference into the deed. The standard minimum deed terms addendum will specify the terms that will prevail in the event of a conflict.


(2) If an eligible entity agrees to use the standard set of minimum deed terms as published by NRCS, NRCS and the eligible entity will identify in the ALE-agreement the use of the standard minimum deed terms as a requirement and National Office review of individual deeds may not be required. NRCS may place priority on applications where an eligible entity agrees to use the standard set of minimum deed terms as published.


(3) The eligible entity must submit all individual agricultural land easement deeds to NRCS at least 90 days before the planned easement closing date and be approved by NRCS in advance of use.


(4) Eligible entities with multiple eligible parcels may submit an agricultural land easement deed template for review and approval. The deed templates must be reviewed and approved by NRCS in advance of use.


(5) NRCS may conduct an additional review of the agricultural land easement deeds for individual parcels prior to the execution of the easement deed by the landowner and the eligible entity to ensure that they contain the same language as approved by the National Office and that the appropriate site-specific information has been included.


(g) The eligible entity will acquire, hold, manage, monitor, and enforce the easement. The eligible entity may have the option to enter into an agreement with appropriately qualified governmental or private organizations that have no property rights or interests in the easement area to carry out easement monitoring, management, and enforcement responsibilities.


(h) All agricultural land easement deeds acquired with ACEP-ALE funds must be recorded. The eligible entity will provide proof of recordation to NRCS within the timeframe specified in the ALE-agreement.
