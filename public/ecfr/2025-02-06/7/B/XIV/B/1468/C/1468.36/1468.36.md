(c) Payments may be made for repair or replacement of an eligible conservation practice or activity, if NRCS determines that the conservation practice or eligible activity is still needed and that the disrepair or failure of the original conservation practice or eligible activity was due to reasons beyond the control of the participant.


(d) A participant may seek additional assistance from other public or private organizations as long as the conservation practices or eligible activities funded are approved by NRCS and implemented in compliance with this part.
