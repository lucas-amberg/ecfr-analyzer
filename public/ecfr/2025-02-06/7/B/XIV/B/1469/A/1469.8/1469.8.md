# ยง 1469.8   Conservation practices and activities.

(a) *Conservation practice and activity selection.* (1) The Chief will provide a list of structural and land management practices and activities eligible for each CSP payment component. If the Chief's designee provides the list, it will be approved by the Director of the Financial Assistance Programs Division of NRCS. When determining the lists of practices and activities and their associated rates, the Chief will consider:


(i) The cost and potential conservation benefits;


(ii) The degree of treatment of significant resource concerns;


(iii) The number of resource concerns the practice or activity will address;


(iv) Locally available technology;


(v) New and emerging conservation technology;


(vi) Ability to address the resource concern based on site specific conditions; and,


(vii) The need for cost-share assistance for specific practices and activities to help producers achieve higher management intensity levels or to advance in tiers of eligibility.


(2) To address unique resource conditions in a State or region, the Chief may make additional conservation practices, measures, and enhancement activities eligible that are not included in the national list of eligible CSP practices.


(3) NRCS will make the list of eligible practices and activities and their individual payment rates available to the public.


(b) NRCS will consider the qualified practices and activities in its computation of CSP payments except as provided for in paragraph (d) of this section.


(c) NRCS will not make new practice payments for a conservation practice the producer has applied prior to application to the program.


(d) New practice payments will not be made to a participant who has implemented or initiated the implementation of a conservation practice prior to approval of the contract, unless a waiver was granted by the State Conservationist or the Designated Conservationist prior to the installation of the practice.


(e) Where new technologies or conservation practices that show high potential for optimizing environmental benefits are available, NRCS may approve interim conservation practice standards and financial assistance for pilot work to evaluate and assess the performance, efficacy, and effectiveness of the technology or conservation practices.


(f) NRCS will set the minimum level of treatment within land management practices at the national level; however, the State Conservationist may supplement specific criteria to meet localized conditions within the State or areas.
