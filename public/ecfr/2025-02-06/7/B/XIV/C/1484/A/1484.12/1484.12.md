(a) To participate in the Cooperator program, an entity must be a nonprofit U.S. agricultural trade organization that promotes the exports of one or more U.S. agricultural commodities, does not have a business interest in or receive remuneration from specific sales of agricultural commodities, and contributes at least 50 percent of the value of resources reimbursed by CCC for activities conducted under the agreement.
