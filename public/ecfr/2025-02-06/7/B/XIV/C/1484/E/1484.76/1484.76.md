# ยง 1484.76   Cooperator appeals of CCC determinations.

(a) Within 30 calendar days of the date of the issuance of a determination, the Cooperator may appeal the determination by making a request in writing that includes the basis for such reconsideration. The Cooperator may also request a hearing.


(b) If the Cooperator requests a hearing, CCC will set a date and time for the hearing. The hearing will be an informal proceeding. A transcript will not ordinarily be prepared unless the Cooperator bears the cost of a transcript; however, CCC may, at its discretion, have a transcript prepared at CCC's expense.


(c) CCC will base its final determination upon information contained in the administrative record. The Cooperator must exhaust all administrative remedies contained in this section before pursuing judicial review of a determination by CCC.
