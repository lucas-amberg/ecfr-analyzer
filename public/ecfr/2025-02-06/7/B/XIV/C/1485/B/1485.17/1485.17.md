# § 1485.17   Reimbursement rules.

(a) A MAP Participant may seek reimbursement for an eligible expenditure if:


(1) The expenditure was necessary and reasonable for the performance of an approved activity; and


(2) The Participant has not been and will not be reimbursed for such expenditure by any other source.


(b) Subject to paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section, as well as the cost principles in 2 CFR 200 to the extent these principles do not directly conflict with the provisions of this subpart, for either brand or generic promotion activities, CCC will reimburse, in whole or in part, the cost of:


(1) Production and placement of advertising, including in print, electronic media, billboards, or posters, which may include advertising the availability of price discounts, except that advertising associated with a coupon or price discount for the MAP-promoted product is not reimbursable. If advertising is related to both coupons or price discounts for products other than the MAP Participant's promoted products as well as for MAP-promoted products, expenditures for such advertising will not be reimbursed in whole or in part (*e.g.,* expenditures may not be prorated and submitted for reimbursement). Electronic media includes, but is not limited to, radio, television, electronic mail, internet, telephone, text messaging, and podcasting;


(2) Production and distribution of banners, recipe cards, table tents, shelf talkers, and other similar point of sale materials;

However, non-travel expenditures associated with retail, trade, and consumer exhibits and shows held inside the United States are reimbursable only if the exhibit or show is included on the list of approved U.S. exhibits and shows announced via a program notice issued on FAS' website and the exhibit or show is one that the MAP Participant has not participated in within the last three years using funds from a source other than the MAP. Retail, trade, and consumer exhibits and shows held inside the United States may be considered for inclusion on the list of approved exhibits and shows if they are:


(i) A food or agricultural exhibit or show with no less than 30% of exhibitors selling food or agricultural products; and


(ii) An international exhibit or show that targets buyers, distributors, and the like from more than one foreign country and no less than 15% of its visitors are from countries other than the host country;


(8) Subject to paragraph (b)(18) of this section, international travel expenditures (with airfare limited to the full fare economy rate), including per diem and any fees for passports, visas, inoculations, and modifying the originally purchased airline ticket, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304), for no more than two representatives of a single brand participant (or MAP Participant directly running its own brand program) to exhibit their company's (or cooperative's) products at a retail, trade, or consumer exhibit or show held outside the United States. Representatives may include employees and board members of private companies, employees or members of cooperatives, or any broker, consultant, or marketing representative contracted by the company or cooperative to represent the company or cooperative in sales transactions;


(9) Subscriptions that are of a technical, economic, or marketing nature and that are relevant to the approved activities of the MAP Participant;


(10) Demonstrators, interpreters, translators, receptionists, and similar temporary workers who help with the implementation of individual promotional activities, such as trade shows, in-store promotions, food service promotions, and trade seminars;


(11) Giveaways, awards, prizes, gifts, and other similar promotional materials, subject to such reimbursement limitation as CCC may determine and announce in writing to MAP Participants via a program notice issued on FAS' website. Reimbursement is available only when:


(i) The items are described in detail with a per unit cost in an approved strategic plan; and


(ii) Distribution of the promotional item is not contingent upon the consumer, or other target audience, purchasing a good or service to receive the promotional item;


(12) The design and production of packaging, labeling, or origin identification to be used during the program year in which the expenditure is made, if such packaging, labeling, or origin identification is necessary to meet the importing requirements of a foreign country;


(13) The design, production, and distribution of coupons for products other than the MAP Participant's promoted products. If such activities include both coupons or price discounts for products other than the MAP Participant's promoted products as well as for MAP-promoted products, expenditures for such activities will not be reimbursed in whole or in part (*e.g.,* expenditures may not be prorated and submitted for reimbursement);


(14) An audit of a MAP Participant as required by 2 CFR part 200, subpart F if the MAP is the MAP Participant's largest source of Federal funding;

(17) International travel expenditures (with airfare limited to the full fare economy rate), including per diem and any fees for passports, visas, inoculations, and modifying the originally purchased airline ticket, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304), incurred for a foreign trade mission conducted outside the United States that is an activity under an approved branded program and that has met the following conditions:


(i) Trade mission travel for company (or cooperative) representatives was identified as a separate approved activity in the MAP Participant's UES;


(ii) The trade mission included representatives, as defined in paragraph (b)(8) of this section, from a minimum of five different companies (or cooperatives), and no more than two representatives from each participating company (or cooperative);


(iii) The appropriate FAS overseas office supported the trade mission by dedicating meaningful funding or other resources (such as facilities or staff time) to the activity; and


(iv)(A) The MAP Participant with the approved brand program produced an itinerary or agenda for the trade mission that demonstrated that company (or cooperative) representatives would be engaged for a minimum of 6 hours per day (except for the first and last days of the mission) in trade mission activities that include, at a minimum, each of the following:


(*1*) A product showcase where the FAS overseas office approved an invitation list of qualified buyers;


(*2*) Pre-arranged one-on-one business meetings; and


(*3*) Evaluation and feedback sessions with FAS staff and trade mission sponsors.


(B) Reimbursement is conditional on the MAP Participant having notified in writing the Attaché/Counselor in the destination country in advance of the travel;


(18) Where USDA has sponsored or endorsed a U.S. pavilion at a retail, trade, or consumer exhibit or show, whether held outside or inside the United States, MAP funds may be used to reimburse the travel and/or non-travel expenditures of only those MAP Participants located within the U.S. pavilion. Such expenditures must also adhere to the standard terms and conditions of the U.S. pavilion organizer. Upon written request, CCC may temporarily waive this paragraph (b)(18), on a case by case basis, where the trade show is segregated into product pavilions, a company's distributor or importer is located outside the U.S. pavilion, or when a company can demonstrate that there is a benefit to being located outside the U.S. pavilion. Such waiver will be provided to the MAP Participant in writing; and


(19) Contracts with U.S.-based organizations when the only contracted service such organizations provide to a MAP Participant is carrying out a specific market promotion activity in the United States directed to a foreign audience (*e.g.,* a trade mission of foreign buyers coming to the United States to visit U.S. exporters). Such contracts may be reimbursable as a direct promotional expense. If a U.S.-based organization provides administrative services to the MAP Participant's domestic home office during a program year, any direct promotional services such organization provides to the Participant, whether for the Participant's domestic or overseas offices, during the same program year are not reimbursable.


(c) Subject to paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section, as well as the cost principles in 2 CFR part 200 to the extent these principles do not directly conflict with the provisions of this subpart, but for generic promotion activities only, CCC will also reimburse, in whole or in part, the cost of:


(1) Compensation and allowances for housing, educational tuition, and cost of living adjustments paid to a U.S. citizen employee or a U.S. citizen contractor stationed overseas, provided such benefits are granted under established written policies, except CCC will not reimburse that portion of:


(i) The total of compensation and allowances that exceed 125 percent of the level of a GS-15 Step 10 salary for U.S. Government employees; or


(ii) Allowances that exceed the rate authorized for U.S. Embassy personnel.


(2) Approved Supergrade salaries for non-U.S. citizen employees and non-U.S. contractors stationed overseas;


(3) Compensation of non-U.S. citizen staff employees or non-U.S. contractors stationed overseas, subject to the following limitations:


(i) Where there is a local U.S. Embassy Foreign Service National (FSN) salary plan, CCC will not reimburse any portion of such compensation that exceeds the compensation prescribed for the most comparable position in the FSN salary plan, except for approved Supergrades; or


(ii) Where an FSN salary plan does not exist, CCC will not reimburse any portion of such compensation that exceeds locally prevailing levels, which the MAP Participant shall document by a salary survey or other means, except for approved Supergrades;


(4) A retroactive salary adjustment for non-U.S. citizen staff employees or non-U.S. contractors stationed overseas that conforms to a change in FSN salary plans, effective as of the date of such change;


(5) Accrued annual leave as of the time employment is terminated or as of such time as required by local law;


(6) Overtime paid to clerical staff of approved MAP-funded overseas offices;


(7) Temporary contractor fees for contractors stationed overseas, except CCC will not reimburse any portion of any such fee that exceeds the daily gross GS-15, Step 10 salary for U.S. Government employees in effect on the date the fee is earned, unless a bidding process reveals that such a contractor is not available at or below that salary rate;


(8)(i) Subject to paragraph (b)(18) of this section, international travel expenditures, including per diem and any fees for passports, visas, inoculations, and modifying the originally purchased airline ticket, for activities held outside the United States or in the United States, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304), except that if the activity is participation in a retail, trade, or consumer exhibit or show held inside the United States, international travel expenditures are reimbursable only if the exhibit or show is included on the list of approved U.S. exhibits and shows announced via a program notice issued on FAS' website and the exhibit or show is one that the Participant has not participated in within the last three years using funds from a source other than the MAP. Retail, trade, and consumer exhibits and shows held inside the United States may be considered for inclusion on the list of approved exhibits and shows if they are:


(A) A food or agricultural exhibit or show with no less than 30% of exhibitors selling food or agricultural products; and


(B) An international exhibit or show that targets buyers, distributors, and the like from more than one foreign country and no less than 15% of its visitors are from countries other than the host country.


(ii) CCC generally will not reimburse any portion of air travel, including any fees for modifying the originally purchased ticket, in excess of the full fare economy rate. If a traveler flies in business class or a different premium class, the basis for reimbursement will be the full fare economy class rate for the same flight and the MAP Participant shall provide documentation establishing such full fare economy class rate to support its reimbursement claim. If economy class is not offered for the same flight or if the traveler flies on a charter flight, the basis for reimbursement will be the average of the full fare economy class rate for flights offered by three different airlines between the same points on the same date and the MAP Participant shall provide documentation establishing such average of the full fare economy class rates to support its reimbursement claim.


(iii) In very limited circumstances, the MAP Participant may be reimbursed for air travel up to the business class rate (*i.e.,* a premium class rate other than the first class rate). Such circumstances are:


(A) Regularly scheduled flights between the origin and destination points do not offer economy class (or equivalent) airfare and the MAP Participant receives written documentation to that effect at the time the tickets are purchased;


(B) Business class air travel is necessary to accommodate an eligible traveler's disability. Such disability must be substantiated in writing by a physician; or


(C) An eligible traveler's origin and/or destination are outside of the continental United States and the scheduled flight time, beginning with the scheduled departure time and ending with the scheduled arrival time, including stopovers and changes of planes, exceeds 14 hours. In such cases, per diem and other allowable expenses will also be reimbursable for the day of arrival. However, no expenses will be reimbursable for a rest period or for any non-work days (*e.g.,* weekends, holidays, personal leave, etc.) immediately following the date of arrival. A stopover is the time a traveler spends at an airport, other than the originating or destination airport, which is a normally scheduled part of a flight. A change of planes is the time a traveler spends at an airport, other than the originating or destination airport, to disembark from one flight and embark on another. All travel should follow a direct or usually traveled route. Under no circumstances should a traveler select flights in a manner that extends the scheduled flight time to beyond 14 hours in part to secure eligibility for reimbursement of business class travel;


(iv) Alternatively, in lieu of reimbursing up to the business class rate in such circumstances, CCC will reimburse economy class airfare plus per diem and other allowable travel expenses related to a rest period of up to 24 hours, either en route or upon arrival at the destination. For a trip with multiple destinations, each origin/destination combination will be considered separately when applying the 14-hour rule for eligibility of reimbursement of business class travel or rest period expenses;


(9) Automobile mileage at the local U.S. Embassy rate or rental cars while in travel status;


(10) Other allowable expenditures while in travel status as authorized by the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304);


(11) Organization costs for overseas offices approved in agreements. Such costs include incorporation fees, brokers' fees, fees to attorneys, accountants, or investment counselors, whether or not employees of the organization, incurred in connection with the establishment or reorganization of the overseas office, and rent, utilities, communications originating overseas, office supplies, accident liability insurance premiums (provided the types and extent and cost of coverage are in accordance with the MAP Participant's policy and sound business practice), and routine accounting and legal services required to maintain the overseas office;


(12) With prior CCC approval, the purchase, lease, or repair of, or insurance premiums for, capital goods that have an expected useful life of at least one year, such as furniture, equipment, machinery, removable fixtures, draperies, blinds, floor coverings, computer hardware and software, and portable electronic communications devices (including mobile phones, wireless email devices, and personal digital assistants);


(13) Such premiums for health or accident insurance and other benefits for foreign national employees that the employer is required by law to pay, provided that such benefits are granted under established written policies;


(14) Accident liability insurance premiums for facilities used jointly with third-party participants for MAP activities or for MAP-funded travel of third-party participants, provided the types and extent and cost of coverage are in accordance with the MAP Participant's policy and sound business practice;


(15) Market research, including research to determine the types of products that are desired in a market;


(16) Independent evaluations and audits, if not otherwise required by CCC, to ensure compliance with program requirements;


(17) Legal fees to obtain advice on the host country's labor laws;


(18) Employment agency fees;


(19) STRE incurred outside of the United States, and STRE incurred in conjunction with an approved activity taking place within the United States with prior written approval from CCC. MAP Participants are required to use the appropriate American Embassy representational funding guidelines for breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and receptions. MAP Participants may exceed Embassy guidelines only when they have received written authorization from the FAS Attaché/Counselor at the Embassy. The amount of unauthorized STRE expenses that exceed the guidelines will not be reimbursed. MAP Participants must pay the difference between the total cost of STRE events and the appropriate amount as determined by the guidelines. For STRE incurred in the United States, the MAP Participant should provide, in its request for approval, the basis for determining its proposed expenses;


(20) Evacuation payments (safe haven) and shipment and storage of household goods and motor vehicles for relocations lasting at least 12 months;


(21) U.S. office(s) administrative support expenses for the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, the SRTGs, and the Intertribal Agriculture Council;


(22) Non-travel expenditures associated with conducting international staff conferences held either in or outside the United States;


(23) Subject to paragraph (b)(18) of this section, domestic travel expenditures, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304), for international retail, trade, and consumer exhibits and shows conducted in the United States. Domestic travel expenses to such a show or exhibit are covered only if the exhibit or show is included on the list of approved U.S. exhibits and shows announced via a program notice issued on FAS' website and the exhibit or show is one that the Participant has not participated in within the last three years using funds from a source other than the MAP. Retail and trade exhibits and shows held inside the United States may be considered for inclusion on the list of approved exhibits and shows if they are:


(i) A food or agricultural exhibit or show with no less than 30% of exhibitors selling food or agricultural products; and


(ii) An international exhibit or show that targets buyers, distributors, and the like from more than one foreign country and no less than 15% of its visitors are from countries other than the host country;


(24) Domestic travel expenditures, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304), for seminars and educational training conducted in the United States;

(ii) Such trade missions or technical team visits have been approved by CCC; and


(iii) The MAP-sponsored traveler submits a follow-up trip report to CCC that includes the following:

Expenditures related to websites or portions of websites that are accessible only to an organization's members are not reimbursable. Reimbursement claims for websites that include any sort of “members only” sections must be prorated to exclude the costs associated with those areas subject to restricted access;


(31) Expenditures not otherwise prohibited from reimbursement that are associated with activities held in the United States or abroad designed to improve market access by specifically addressing temporary, permanent, or impending technical barriers to trade that prohibit or threaten U.S. exports of agricultural commodities;

(33) Refreshments, or related equipment, for office staff; and


(34) Expenditures associated with a MAP Participant's creation or review of their fraud prevention program, contracting procedures, or brand program operational procedures.


(e) Paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section shall apply to the approval of Supergrades.


(1) With respect to individuals who are not U.S. citizens and who are hired by MAP Participants either as employees or contractors acting as employees, CCC will not ordinarily reimburse any portion of such individual's compensation that exceeds the compensation prescribed for the most comparable position in the FSN salary plan applicable to the country in which the employee or contractor works. However, a MAP Participant may seek a higher level of reimbursement for a non-U.S. citizen employee or contractor who will be employed as a country director or regional director by requesting that CCC approve that employee or contractor as a Supergrade.


(2) To request approval of a Supergrade, the MAP Participant shall provide CCC with a detailed description of both the duties and responsibilities of the position and the qualifications and background of the employee or contractor concerned. The Participant shall also justify why the comparable FSN salary level is insufficient.


(3) Where a non-U.S. citizen employee or contractor will be employed as a country director, the MAP Participant may request approval for a “Supergrade I” salary level, equivalent to a single grade increase over the existing top grade of the FSN salary plan. The Supergrade I and its step increases are calculated by increasing each of the steps in the top FSN grade by the percentage difference between the second highest and the highest grade in the FSN salary plan. Where the non-U.S. citizen employee or contractor will be employed as a regional director, with responsibility for activities and/or offices in more than one country, the MAP Participant may request approval for a “Supergrade II” salary level, which is calculated relative to a Supergrade I in the same way the latter is calculated relative to the highest grade in the FSN salary plan.


(4) A U.S. citizen with dual citizenship with another foreign country or countries shall not be considered a non-U.S. citizen.


(f) For a brand promotion activity, CCC will reimburse no more than 50 percent of the total eligible expenditures made on that activity.


(g) CCC will reimburse for expenditures made after the conclusion of a MAP Participant's program year provided:


(1) The activity was approved by CCC prior to the end of the program year;


(2) The activity was completed within 30 calendar days following the end of the program year; and


(3) All expenditures were made for the activity within 6 months following the end of the program year.


(h) A MAP Participant shall not use MAP funds for any activity, or any expenses incurred by the MAP Participant prior to the date specified in the approval letter or after the date the agreement is suspended or terminated, except as otherwise permitted by CCC.


(i) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, MAP-funded travel shall conform to the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 300 through 304) and 2 CFR part 200, and MAP-funded air travel shall conform to the requirements of the Fly America Act (49 U.S.C. 40118). The MAP Participant shall notify the Attaché/Counselor in the destination country(ies) in writing in advance of any proposed travel. The timing of such notice should be far enough in advance to enable the Attaché/Counselor to schedule appointments, make preparations, or otherwise provide any assistance being requested. Failure to provide advance notification of travel generally will result in disallowance of the expenses related to the travel, unless CCC determines it was impractical to provide such notification.


(j) CCC may determine, at CCC's discretion, whether any cost not expressly listed in this section will be reimbursed.
