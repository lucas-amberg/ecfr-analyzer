(D) If none of the foregoing are available, a memo to the files of the MAP Participant's estimate of what contribution or cost share was made by the U.S. industry or State agency, item by item, and the method used to assign a value to each.


(ii) The documentation required in paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this section must include the dates, purpose, and location of the activity for which the cash or in-kind items were claimed as a contribution or cost share, who conducted the activity, the participating groups or individuals, and the method of computing the claimed contribution or cost share. MAP Participants must retain and make available for compliance reviews and audits documentation related to claimed contribution or cost share.


(f) Upon request, a MAP Participant shall provide documents supporting reimbursement claims to CCC. CCC may deny a claim for reimbursement if the claim is not supported by adequate documentation.
