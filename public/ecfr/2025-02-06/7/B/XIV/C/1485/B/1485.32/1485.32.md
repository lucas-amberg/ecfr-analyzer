# ยง 1485.32   Program income.

Program income is gross income earned by the non-Federal entity that is directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of the Federal award during the period of performance. Any income generated from an activity, the expenditures for which have been wholly or partially reimbursed with MAP funds, shall be used by the MAP Participant in furtherance of its approved MAP activities in the program year during which the MAP funds are available for obligation by the MAP Participant, or must be returned to CCC. The use of such income shall be governed by this subpart. Interest earned on funds advanced by CCC is not program income. Reasonable activity fees or registration fees, if identified as such in a project budget, may be charged for approved activities. The intent to charge a fee must be part of the original proposal, along with an explanation of how such fees are to be used. Any activity fees charged must be used to offset activity expenses or returned to FAS. Such fees may not be used as profit or counted as contribution or cost share.
