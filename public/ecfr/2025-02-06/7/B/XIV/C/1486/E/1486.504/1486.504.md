Program income means gross income earned by the Recipient that is directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of the Federal award during the period of performance. Any such income generated from an activity, the expenditures for which have been wholly or partially reimbursed with EMP funds, shall be used by the Recipient in furtherance of its approved activities in the program period during which the EMP funds are available for obligation by the Recipient, or must be returned to CCC. The use of such income shall be governed by this part. Reasonable activity fees or registration fees, if identified as such in a project budget, may be charged for projects approved for program funding. The intent to charge a fee must be part of the original proposal, along with an explanation of how such fees are to be used. Any activity fees charged must be used to offset activity expenses or returned to CCC. Such fees may not be used as profit or counted as cost share.
