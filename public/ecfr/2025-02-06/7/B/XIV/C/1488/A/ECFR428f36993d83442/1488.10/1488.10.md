(d) If the evidence of entry is in other than the English language, the exporter shall also provide an English translation thereof. 


(e) Failure to furnish, within the time specified, evidence of entry of the commodity into the country of destination shall constitute prima facie evidence of failure to enter or to cause the entry of the commodity into such country as required.
