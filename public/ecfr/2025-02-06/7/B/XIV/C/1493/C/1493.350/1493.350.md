# ยง 1493.350   Notice of default.

(a) *Notice of default.* If the foreign financial institution issuing the letter of credit fails to make payment pursuant to the terms of the letter of credit or the terms and conditions document, the holder of the payment guarantee must submit a notice of default to CCC as soon as possible, but not later than 5 business days after the date that payment was due from the foreign financial institution (the due date). A notice of default must be submitted in writing to CCC in the manner specified on the USDA Web site and must include the following information:


(1) Payment guarantee number;


(2) Name of the destination country as shown on the payment guarantee;


(3) Name of the defaulting foreign financial institution;


(4) Payment due date;


(5) Total amount of the defaulted payment due, indicating separately the amounts for principal and ordinary interest, and including a copy of the repayment schedule with due dates, principal amounts and ordinary interest rates for each installment;


(6) Date of foreign financial institution's refusal to pay, if applicable;


(7) Reason for foreign financial institution's refusal to pay, if known, and copies of any correspondence with the foreign financial institution regarding the default.


(b) *Failure to comply with time limit for submission.* If the holder of the payment guarantee fails to notify CCC of a default within 5 business days, CCC may deny the claim for that default.


(c) *Impact of a default on other existing payment guarantees.*

(1) In the event that a foreign financial institution defaults under a repayment obligation under this subpart or under 7 CFR 1493, subpart B, CCC may declare that such foreign financial institution is no longer eligible to provide additional Letters of Credit under the FGP. If CCC determines that such defaulting foreign financial institution is no longer eligible for the FGP, CCC shall provide written notice of such ineligibility to all sellers and assignees, if any, having payment guarantees covering transactions with respect to which the defaulting foreign financial institution is expected to issue a letter of credit. Receipt of written notice from CCC that a defaulting foreign financial institution is no longer eligible to provide additional Letters of Credit under the FGP shall constitute withdrawal of coverage of that foreign financial institution under all payment guarantees with respect to any letter of credit issued on or after the date of receipt of such written notice. CCC will not withdraw coverage of the defaulting foreign financial institution under any payment guarantee with respect to any letter of credit issued before the date of receipt of such written notice.


(2) If CCC withdraws coverage of the defaulting foreign financial institution, CCC will permit the seller (with concurrence of the assignee, if any) to utilize another approved foreign financial institution, and will consider other requested amendments to the payment guarantee, for the balance of the transaction covered by the payment guarantee. If no alternate foreign financial institution is identified to issue the letter of credit within 30 calendar days, CCC will cancel the payment guarantee and refund the seller's guarantee fees corresponding to any unutilized portion of the payment guarantee.
