By providing the statement in § 1493.430(a)(17), the exporter is certifying that the information provided in the application is true and correct and, further, that all requirements set forth in this section have been or will be met. The exporter will be required to provide further explanation or documentation with regard to applications that do not include this statement. The exporter, in submitting an application for a payment guarantee and providing the statement set forth in § 1493.430(a)(17), certifies that: 


(a) The agricultural commodity or product to be exported under the payment guarantee is a U.S. agricultural commodity as defined by § 1493.410(x).


(b) There have not been and will not be any corrupt payments or extra sales services or other items extraneous to the transaction provided, financed, or guaranteed in connection with the transaction, and that the transaction complies with applicable United States law; 


(c) If the agricultural commodity is vegetable oil or a vegetable oil product, that none of the agricultural commodity or product has been or will be used as a basis for a claim of a refund, as drawback, pursuant to section 313 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1313, of any duty, tax or fee imposed under Federal law on an imported commodity or product; 


(d) No person or selling agency has been employed or retained to solicit or secure the payment guarantee, and that there is no agreement or understanding for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee, except in the case of bona fide employees or bona fide established commercial or selling agencies maintained by the exporter for the purpose of securing business; and 


(e) The information provided pursuant to § 1493.420 has not changed, the exporter still meets all of the qualification requirements of § 1493.420, and the exporter will immediately notify CCC if there is a change of circumstances which would cause it to fail to meet such requirements. If the exporter breaches or violates these certifications with respect to a SCGP payment guarantee, CCC will have the right, notwithstanding any other rights provided under this subpart, to annul guarantee coverage for any commodities not yet exported and/or to proceed against the exporter.
