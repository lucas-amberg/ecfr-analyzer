(1) Is not engaged in, and will not engage in, supplying commodities or furnishing ocean transportation or ocean transportation-related services for commodities provided under any FFPr Program agreement to which the recipient is a party; and


(2) Is not affiliated with the recipient and has not made arrangements to give or receive any payment, kickback, or illegal benefit in connection with its selection as an agent of the recipient.


(f) A recipient will be responsible for arranging and paying for any transportation of the donated commodities after their arrival at the designated discharge port or point of entry for as long as the recipient has title to such donated commodities, except as may otherwise be provided in the agreement.
