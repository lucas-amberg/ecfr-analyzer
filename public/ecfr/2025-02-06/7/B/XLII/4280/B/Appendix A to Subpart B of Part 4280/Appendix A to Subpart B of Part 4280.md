# Appendix A to Subpart B of Part 4280—Technical Reports for Energy Efficiency Improvement (EEI) Projects


For all EEI projects with total project costs of more than $80,000, provide the information specified in Sections A and D and in Section B or Section C, as applicable. If the application is for an EEI project with total project costs of $80,000 or less, please see § 4280.120 (b)(3) for the technical report information to be submitted with your application.


If the application is for an EEI project with total project costs of $200,000 and greater, you must conduct an energy audit. However, if the application is for an EEI project with a total project costs of less than $200,000, you may conduct either an energy assessment or an energy audit.


*Section A—Project Information.* Describe how all the improvements to or replacement of an existing building and/or equipment meet the requirements of being commercially available. Describe how the design, engineering, testing, and monitoring are sufficient to demonstrate that the proposed project will meet its intended purpose, ensure public safety, and comply with applicable laws, regulations, agreements, permits, codes, and standards. Describe how all equipment required for the EEI(s) is available and able to be procured and delivered within the proposed project development schedule. In addition, present information regarding component warranties and the availability of spare parts.


*Section B—Energy audit.* If conducting an energy audit, provide the following information.


(1) *Situation report.* Provide a narrative description of the existing building and/or equipment, its energy system(s) and usage, and activity profile. Also include average price per unit of energy (electricity, natural gas, propane, fuel oil, renewable energy, etc.) paid by the customer for the most recent 12 months, or an average of 2, 3, 4, or 5 years, for the building and equipment being audited. Any energy conversion should be based on use rather than source.


(2) *Potential improvement description.* Provide a narrative summary of the potential improvement and its ability to reduce energy consumption or improve energy efficiency, including a discussion of reliability and durability of the improvements.


(i) Provide preliminary specifications for critical components.


(ii) Provide preliminary drawings of project layout, including any related structural changes.


(iii) Identify significant changes in future related operations and maintenance costs.


(iv) Describe explicitly how outcomes will be measured.


(3) *Technical analysis.* Give consideration to the interactions among the potential improvements and the current energy system(s).


(i) For the most recent 12 months, or an average of 2, 3, 4, or 5 years, prior to the date the application is submitted, provide both the total amount and the total cost of energy used for the original building and/or equipment, as applicable, for each improvement identified in the potential project. In addition, provide for each improvement identified in the potential project an estimate of the total amount of energy that would have been used and the total cost that would have been incurred if the proposed project were in operation for this same time period.


(ii) Calculate all direct and attendant indirect costs of each improvement;


(iii) Rank potential improvements measures by cost-effectiveness; and


(iv) Provide an estimate of Simple Payback, including all calculations, documentation, and any assumptions.


(4) *Qualifications of the auditor.* Provide the qualifications of the person which completed the energy audit.


*Section C—Energy Assessment.* If conducting an Energy Assessment, provide the following information.


(1) *Situation report.* Provide a narrative description of the existing building and/or equipment, its energy system(s) and usage, and activity profile. Also include average price per unit of energy (electricity, natural gas, propane, fuel oil, renewable energy, etc.) paid by the customer for the most recent 12 months, or an average of 2, 3, 4, or 5 years, for the building and equipment being evaluated. Any energy conversion shall be based on use rather than source.


(2) *Potential improvement description.* Provide a narrative summary of the potential improvement and its ability to reduce energy consumption or improve energy efficiency.


(3) *Technical analysis.* Giving consideration to the interactions among the potential improvements and the current energy system(s), provide the information specified in section C(3)(i) through (iii) of this appendix.


(i) For the most recent 12 months, or an average of 2, 3, 4, or 5 years, prior to the date the application is submitted, provide both the total amount and the total cost of energy used for the original building and/or equipment, as applicable, for each improvement identified in the potential project. In addition, provide for each improvement identified in the potential project an estimate of the total amount of energy that would have been used and the total cost that would have been incurred if the proposed project were in operation for this same time period.


(ii) Document baseline data compared to projected consumption, together with any explanatory notes on source of the projected consumption data. When appropriate, show before-and-after data in terms of consumption per unit of production, time, or area.


(iii) Provide an estimate of Simple Payback, including all calculations, documentation, and any assumptions.


(4) *Qualifications of the assessor.* Provide the qualifications of the person that completed the assessment. If the energy assessment for a project with total project costs of $80,000 or less is not conducted by Energy Auditor or Energy Assessor, then the person must have at least 3 years of experience and completed at least five energy assessments or energy audits on similar type projects.


*Section D—Qualifications.* Provide a resume or other evidence of the contractor or installer's qualifications and experience with the proposed EEI technology. Any contractor or installer with less than 2 years of experience may be required to provide additional information in order for the Agency to determine if they are qualified installer/contractor.
