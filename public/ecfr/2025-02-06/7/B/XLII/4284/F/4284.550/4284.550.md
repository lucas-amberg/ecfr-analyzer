Applications will be selected for further processing and consideration of an award after the merit evaluation process is completed for all eligible applications. Applications will be ranked solely based on the points awarded, and they will be funded in rank order until available funds are expended. If there is a tie, the Administrator of the Agency will use discretion to break the tie to improve the geographic diversity of Recipients and/or prioritize Projects that advance the Department or Agency's key priorities, goals, and objectives. If an application cannot be fully funded, the Agency may offer partial funding to the extent funds are available. If an application is ranked and not funded, it will not be carried forward into the next funding competition.
