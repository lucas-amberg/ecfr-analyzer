# ยง 4287.301   Introduction.

(a) This subpart supplements 7 CFR part 4279, subpart C by providing additional requirements and instructions for servicing and liquidating all loans guaranteed under 7 CFR part 4279, subpart C.


(b) The Lender is responsible for servicing the entire loan and will remain mortgagee and secured party of record notwithstanding the fact that another party may hold a portion of the loan. The entire loan must continue to be secured by the same security with equal lien priority for the guaranteed and unguaranteed portions of the loan. The unguaranteed portion of a loan will neither be paid first nor given any preference or priority over the guaranteed portion of the loan.


(c) All loan servicing actions under this subpart, except for those identified in ยง 4287.307(a) through (g), are subject to Agency concurrence. Whether specifically stated or not, whenever Agency approval is required, it must be in writing. Whenever Agency approval is required, such servicing action must be for Good Cause.


(d) Copies of all forms, regulations, and Instructions referenced in this subpart may be obtained from any Agency office and from the USDA Rural Development Web site at *http://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/biorefinery-assistance-program*. Whenever a form is designated in this subpart, that designation includes predecessor and successor forms, if applicable, as specified by the Agency.
