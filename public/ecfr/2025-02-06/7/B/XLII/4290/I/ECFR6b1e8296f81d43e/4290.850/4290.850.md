(a) *Restriction on redemption.* A Portfolio Concern cannot be required to redeem Equity Securities earlier than one year from the date of the first closing unless:


(1) The Portfolio Concern makes a public offering, or has a change of management or control, or files for protection under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, or materially breaches your Financing agreement; or


(2) You make a follow-on Financing, in which case the new securities may be redeemed in less than one year, but no earlier than the redemption date associated with your earliest Financing of the Portfolio Concern.


(b) *Redemption price.* The redemption price must be either:


(1) A fixed amount that is no higher than the price you paid for the securities; or


(2) An amount that cannot be fixed or determined before the time of the redemption. In this case, the redemption price must be based on:


(i) A reasonable formula that reflects the performance of the Portfolio Concern (such as one based on earnings or book value); or


(ii) The fair market value of the Portfolio Concern at the time of redemption, as determined by a professional appraisal performed under an agreement acceptable to both parties.


(c) *Method.* Any method for determining the redemption price must be agreed upon no later than the date of the first (or only) closing of the Financing.
