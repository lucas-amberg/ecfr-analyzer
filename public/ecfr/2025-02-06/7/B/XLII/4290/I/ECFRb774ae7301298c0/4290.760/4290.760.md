# § 4290.760   How a change in size or activity of a Portfolio Concern affects the RBIC and the Portfolio Concern.

(a) *Effect on RBIC of a change in size of a Portfolio Concern.* If a Portfolio Concern was a Smaller Enterprise at the time of the initial Financing but no longer qualifies as such under the size standard applicable to such entity, you may keep your investment in the Portfolio Concern and:


(1) Subject to the overline limitations of § 4290.740, you may provide additional Financing to the Portfolio Concern up to the time it makes a public offering of its securities.


(2) Even after the Portfolio Concern makes a public offering, you may exercise any stock options, warrants, or other rights to purchase Equity Securities which you acquired before the public offering, or fund Commitments you made before the public offering.


(b) *Effect of a change in business activity occurring within one year of RBIC's initial Financing*—(1) *Retention of Financing.* Unless you receive the Agency's written approval, you may not keep your Financing in a Portfolio Concern which becomes ineligible for financing by a RBIC by reason of a change in its business or commercial activity or for any other reason within one year of your initial Financing in the Portfolio Concern.


(2) *Request for approval to retain Financing.* If you request that the Agency approve the retention of your investment, your request must include sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the change in business or commercial activity was caused by an unforeseen change in circumstances and was not contemplated at the time the Financing was made.


(3) *Additional Financing.* If the Agency approves your request to retain a Financing under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, you may provide additional Financing to the Portfolio Concern to the extent necessary to protect against the loss of the amount of your original investment, subject to the overline limitations of § 4290.740.


(c) *Effect of a change in business activity occurring more than one year after the initial Financing.* If a Portfolio Concern becomes ineligible because of a change in business activity more than one year after your initial Financing you may:


(1) Retain your investment; and


(2) Provide additional Financing to the Portfolio Concern to the extent necessary to protect against the loss of the amount of your original investment, subject to the overline limitations of § 4290.740.
