# ยง 4290.3015   Evaluation and selection of Non-leveraged RBICs.

(a) *General.* Notwithstanding any other provision in this part, when selecting applications for non-leveraged status, the Agency may select one or more applications, or none, for further consideration based on the evaluation criteria of this part.


(b) *Eligibility and completeness.* In addition to the requirements specified in ยง 4290.350, an Applicant under this subpart must complete a written application that includes information not otherwise exempted by the Agency, in its sole discretion. The Agency may, on its own initiative, exempt material from a Non-leveraged RBIC application where the Agency determines it impedes an expedited process without a commensurate benefit to the program. To the extent that the Agency's exemption applies to the entire program, an announcement of the exemption will be published in the _Federal Register._ The Agency shall make a decision as to licensing an Applicant after the receipt of a complete application and will enter into a Participation Agreement with the RBIC if approved.


(c) *Effect of a RBIC license.* Paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of ยง 4290.390 do not apply to Non-leveraged RBICs.
