If the Secretary of Agriculture has reason to believe that the perishable product(s) which is the subject of a petition under this subpart is being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing a perishable product like or directly competitive with the imported perishable product and that emergency action is warranted, the Secretary, within 14 days after the filing of the petition under ยง 1540.23 shall recommend to the President that the President take emergency action. If the Secretary determines not to recommend the imposition of emergency action, the Secretary, within 14 days after the filing of the petition, will publish in the _Federal Register_ a notice of such determination and will so advise the petitioner.
