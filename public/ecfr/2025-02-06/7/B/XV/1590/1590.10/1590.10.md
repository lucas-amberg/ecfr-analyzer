(a) The recipient will be responsible for the procured commodities following the transfer of title to the procured commodities from the commodity vendor(s) to the recipient. FAS may require the recipient to purchase transportation insurance against commodity loss or damage.


(b) A recipient must inform FAS, in the manner and within the time period set forth in the agreement, of any damage to or loss of the procured commodities that occurs following the transfer of title to the procured commodities to the recipient. The recipient must take all steps necessary to protect its interests and the interests of FAS with respect to any damage to or loss of the procured commodities that occurs after title has been transferred to the recipient.


(c) The recipient will be responsible for arranging for an independent cargo surveyor to inspect any procured commodities transported by ocean upon discharge from the vessel and to prepare a survey or outturn report. The report must show the quantity and condition of the procured commodities discharged from the vessel and must indicate the most likely cause of any damage noted in the report. The report must also indicate the time and place when the survey took place. All discharge surveys must be conducted contemporaneously with the discharge of the vessel, unless FAS determines that failure to do so was justified under the circumstances. For procured commodities shipped on a through bill of lading, the recipient must also obtain a delivery survey. All surveys obtained by the recipient must, to the extent practicable, be conducted jointly by the surveyor, the recipient, and the carrier, and the survey report must be signed by all three parties. The recipient must obtain a copy of each discharge or delivery survey report within 45 days after the completion of the survey. The recipient must make each such report available to FAS upon request, or in the manner specified in the agreement. FAS will reimburse the recipient for the reasonable costs of these services, as determined by FAS, in the manner specified in the agreement.


(d) When procured commodities are transported overland, the recipient will ensure that overland transportation contracts include a requirement that a loading and offloading report be prepared and provided to the recipient. The report must show the quantity and condition of the procured commodities loaded on the overland conveyance, as well as the time and place that the loading and offloading occurred. The recipient must obtain a copy of the report from the overland transportation company within 45 days after the completion of the commodity delivery. The recipient must make each such report available to FAS upon request, or in the manner specified in the agreement. FAS will reimburse the recipient for the reasonable costs of these services, as determined by FAS, in the manner specified in the agreement.

(2) The recipient must provide to FAS the names and addresses of any individuals known to be present at the time of discharge or unloading, or during the survey, who can verify the quantity of damaged or lost procured commodities;


(3) If the damage or loss occurred with respect to a bulk shipment on an ocean carrier, the recipient must ensure that the independent cargo surveyor:


(i) Observes the discharge of the cargo;


(ii) Reports on discharging methods, including scale type, calibrations, and any other factors that may affect the accuracy of scale weights, and, if scales are not used, states the reason therefor and describes the actual method used to determine weight;


(iii) Estimates the quantity of cargo, if any, lost during discharge through carrier negligence;


(iv) Advises on the quality of sweepings;


(v) Obtains copies of port or vessel records, if possible, showing the quantity discharged; and

The value of damaged procured commodities must be determined on the basis of the commodity acquisition, transportation, and related costs incurred by the recipient and paid by FAS with respect to such commodities. The recipient must inform FAS of the results of the inspection and indicate whether the damaged procured commodities are:


(1) Fit for the use authorized in the agreement and, if so, whether there has been a diminution in quality; or


(2) Unfit for the use authorized in the agreement.


(f)(1) If the recipient has title to the procured commodities, the recipient must arrange for the recovery of that portion of the procured commodities designated as suitable for the use authorized in the agreement. The recipient must dispose of procured commodities that are unfit for such use in the following order of priority:


(i) Sale for the most appropriate use, *i.e.,* animal feed, fertilizer, industrial use, or another use approved by FAS, at the highest obtainable price;


(ii) Donation to a governmental or charitable organization for use as animal feed or another non-food use; or


(iii) Destruction of the procured commodities if they are unfit for any use, in such manner as to prevent their use for any purpose.
