(1) Notify FAS immediately and provide detailed information about the circumstances surrounding such damage or loss, the quantity of damaged or lost commodities, and the value of the damage or loss;


(2) Promptly upon discovery of the damage or loss, initiate a claim arising out of such damage or loss, including, if appropriate, initiating an action to collect pursuant to a commercial insurance contract;


(3) Take all necessary action to pursue the claim diligently and within any applicable periods of limitations; and


(4) Provide to FAS copies of all documentation relating to the claim.


(c) If a recipient has title to donated commodities or procured commodities that have been damaged or lost, and the value of the damaged or lost commodities is estimated to be $20,000 or less, the recipient must notify FAS in accordance with the agreement and provide detailed information about the damage or loss in the next report required to be filed under ยง 1599.14(f)(1) or (2).

The value of a claim for lost procured commodities will be determined on the basis of the commodity acquisition, transportation, and related costs incurred by the recipient and paid by FAS with respect to such commodities.


(2) The value of a claim for damaged donated commodities will be determined on the basis of the commodity acquisition, transportation, and related costs incurred by FAS with respect to such commodities, as well as such costs incurred by the recipient and paid by FAS, less any funds generated if such commodities are sold in accordance with ยง 1599.10(g)(1). The value of a claim for damaged procured commodities will be determined on the basis of the commodity acquisition, transportation, and related costs incurred by the recipient and paid by FAS with respect to such commodities, less any funds generated if such commodities are sold in accordance with ยง 1599.10(g)(1).
