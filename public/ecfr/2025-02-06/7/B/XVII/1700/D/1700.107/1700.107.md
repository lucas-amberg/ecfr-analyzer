# ยง 1700.107   Considerations relevant to the exercise of SUTA discretionary provisions.

(a) In considering requests to make available financing with an interest rate as low as 2 percent, and extended repayment terms, the Administrator will evaluate the effect of and need for such terms on the finding of financial feasibility.


(b) In considering a request for a non-duplication waiver, the Administrator will consider the offerings of all existing service providers to determine whether or not granting the non-duplication waiver is warranted. A waiver of non-duplication restrictions will not be given if the Administrator determines as a matter of financial feasibility that, taking into account all existing service providers, an applicant or RUS borrower would not be able to repay a loan or successfully implement a grant agreement. Requests for waivers of non-duplication restrictions will be reviewed by taking the following factors into consideration:


(1) The size, extent and demographics of the duplicative area;


(2) The cost of service from existing service providers;


(3) The quality of available service; and


(4) The ability of the existing service provider to serve the eligible service area.


(c) Requests for waivers of matching fund requirements will be evaluated by taking the following factors into consideration:


(1) Whether waivers or reductions in matching or equity requirements would make an otherwise financially infeasible project financially feasible;


(2) Whether permitting a matching requirement to be met with sources not otherwise permitted in an affected program due to regulatory prohibition may be allowed under a separate statutory authority; and


(3) Whether the application could be ranked and scored as if the matching requirements were fully met.


(d) Requests for waivers of credit support requirements will be evaluated taking the following factors into consideration:


(1) The cost and availability of credit support relative to the loan security derived from such support;


(2) The extent to which the requirement is shown to be a barrier to the applicant's participation in the program; and


(3) The alternatives to waiving the requirements.


(e) The Administrator may adapt the manner of assigning highest funding priority to align with the selection methods used for particular programs or funding opportunities.


(1) Eligible programs which use priority point scoring may, in a notice of funds availability or similar notice, assign extra points for SUTA eligible applicants as a means to exercise a discretionary authority under this subpart.


(2) The Administrator may announce a competitive grant opportunity focused exclusively or primarily on trust lands which incorporates one or more discretionary authorities under this subpart into the rules or scoring for the competition.
