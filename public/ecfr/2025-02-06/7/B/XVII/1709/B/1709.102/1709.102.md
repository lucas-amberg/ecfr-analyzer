# § 1709.102   Policy.

(a) All high energy cost grants will be awarded competitively subject to the limited exceptions in 2 CFR 415.1(d).


(b) RUS may give priority consideration to projects that benefit smaller rural communities, communities experiencing economic hardship, projects that extend service to households that lack reliable centralized or commercial energy services, and projects that correct imminent hazards to public safety, welfare, the environment or critical community energy facilities. RUS may also give priority to projects that are coordinated with State rural development initiatives or that serve a Federally-identified Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community (EZ/EC) or a USDA-identified “Champion Community.” Priority consideration will be provided through the award of additional points under the project selection criteria as specified in the grant announcement.
