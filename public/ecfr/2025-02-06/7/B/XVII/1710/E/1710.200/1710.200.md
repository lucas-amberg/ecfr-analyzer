# ยง 1710.200   Purpose.

This subpart contains RUS policies for the preparation, review, approval and use of load forecasts. A load forecast is a thorough study of a borrower's electric loads and the factors that affect those loads in order to estimate, as accurately as practicable, the borrower's future requirements for energy and capacity. The load forecast of a power supply borrower includes and integrates the load forecasts of its member systems. An approved load forecast, if required by this subpart, is one of the primary documents that a borrower is required to submit to support a loan application.
