# § 1714.3   Applicability of provisions.

(a) *Insured electric loans approved on or after November 1, 1993.* On November 1, 1993, the Rural Electrification Loan Restructuring Act, Pub. L. 103-129, 107 Stat. 1356, (RELRA) amended the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, 7 U.S.C. 901 *et seq.,* (RE Act) to establish a new interest rate structure for insured electric loans. Insured electric loans approved on or after this date, are either municipal rate loans or hardship rate loans. Borrowers meeting the criteria set forth in § 1714.8 are eligible for 5 percent hardship rate loans. The interest rate on loans to other borrowers is the municipal interest rate, and borrowers meeting the criteria set forth in § 1714.7 are eligible for the interest rate cap on their municipal rate loans. Interest rates for the initial interest rate term and rollover terms (§ 1714.6) will be determined pursuant to § 1714.4. Provisions for prepayment are set forth in § 1714.9. The provisions of this subpart apply to loans approved on or after November 1, 1993, unless otherwise stated. 


(b) *Insured electric loans approved prior to November 1, 1993.* These loans have a single interest rate applicable to the entire loan. The rate is generally 5 percent, but, in some cases, may be as low as 2 percent. These loans have a single interest rate term and may be prepaid at face value at any time. Provisions for discounted prepayment of these loans are set forth in 7 CFR part 1786.
