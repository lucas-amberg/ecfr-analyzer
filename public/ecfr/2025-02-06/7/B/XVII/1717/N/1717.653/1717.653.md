Any borrower not in compliance with all provisions of its mortgage, loan contract, or any other agreements with RUS must, unless the borrower's mortgage, loan contract, or other agreement with RUS specifically provides otherwise with respect to such a borrower: 


(a) Obtain prior written approval from the Administrator to invest its own funds or to make loans or guarantees regardless of the aggregate amount of such investments, loans, or guarantees; and 


(b) If requested by the Administrator, restructure or reduce the amount of its investments, loans, and guarantees to a level determined by the Administrator, in his or her sole discretion, to be in the financial interest of the government with respect to loan security and/or repayment. If the borrower does not so restructure or reduce its portfolio within a reasonable period of time determined by the Administrator, which shall not exceed 12 months from the date the borrower was notified of the required action, then, upon written notice from RUS, the borrower shall be in default of its RUS loan contract and mortgage.
