Such systems, equipment, and facilities include those listed in 7 CFR 1710.251(c) and 1710.252(c), as well as others that are determined by RUS to be an integral component of the borrower's system of supplying electric and/or steam power to consumers, such as, for example, coal mines, coal handling facilities, railroads and other transportation systems that supply fuel for generation, programs of demand side management and energy conservation, and on-grid and off-grid renewable energy systems;


(2) The purchase, rehabilitation and integration of existing distribution facilities, equipment and systems, and associated service territory;


(3) The following types of community infrastructure substantially located within the electric service territory of the borrower: water and waste disposal systems, solid waste disposal systems, telecommunication and other electronic communications systems, and natural gas distribution systems; 


(4) Front-end costs, when and as the borrower has obtained a binding commitment from the non-RUS lender for the financing required to complete the procurement or construction of the facilities; 


(5) Transaction costs included as part of the cost of financing assets or refinancing existing debt, provided, however, that the amount of transaction costs eligible for lien accommodation or subordination normally shall not exceed 5 percent of the principal amount of financing or refinancing provided, net of all transaction costs; 


(6) The refinancing of existing debt secured under the mortgage; 


(7) Interest during construction of generation and transmission facilities if approved by RUS, case by case, depending on the financial condition of the borrower, the terms of the financing, the nature of the construction, the treatment of these costs by regulatory authorities having jurisdiction, and such other factors deemed appropriate by RUS; and 


(8) Lien subordinations for certain rural development investments, as provided in ยง 1717.858. 


(b) *Purposes ineligible.* The following financing purposes are not eligible for a lien accommodation or subordination from RUS:

(2) Facilities, equipment, appliances, or wiring located inside the premises of the consumer, except: 


(i) Certain load-management equipment (see 7 CFR 1710.251(c)); 


(ii) Renewable energy systems and RUS-approved programs of Demand side management, energy efficiency and energy conservation; and


(iii) As determined by RUS on a case by case basis, facilities included as part of certain cogeneration projects to furnish electric and/or steam power to end-user customers of the borrower; 


(3) Investments in a lender required of the borrower as a condition for obtaining financing; and 


(4) Debt incurred by a distribution or power supply borrower to finance facilities, equipment or other assets that are not part of the borrower's electric system or one of the four community infrastructure systems cited in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, except for certain rural development investments eligible for a lien subordination under ยง 1717.858. 


(c) *Lien subordination for electric utility investments.* RUS will consider subordinating its lien on specific electric utility assets financed by the lender, when the assets can be split off without materially reducing the stability, safety, reliability, operational efficiency, or liquidation value of the rest of the system.
