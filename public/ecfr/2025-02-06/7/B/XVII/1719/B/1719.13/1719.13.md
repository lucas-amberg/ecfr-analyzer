# § 1719.13   Auditing and accounting requirements.

(a) *Accounting requirements.* RESP borrowers must follow RUS accounting requirements as set forth in the loan documents.


(1) Existing RUS borrowers must continue recording and reporting transactions pursuant to the RUS Uniform Systems of Accounts—Electric, 7 CFR part 1767. Such borrowers will continue to follow the accounting and reporting requirements set forth in the previously executed loan documents for RUS outstanding loans.


(2) New and RESP only borrowers must adopt and follow a GAAP based system of accounts acceptable to RUS, as well as compliance with the requirements of 2 CFR part 200 (for RESP Awardees, the term “grant recipient” in 2 CFR part 200 will also mean “loan recipient.”)


(3) All RESP borrowers must promptly notify RUS should a state regulatory authority with jurisdiction over it require it to apply accounting methods or principles different from the ones specified in the loan documents.


(4) RUS will consider borrowers' reasonable proposals to streamline reporting and accounting requirements only when such proposals afford RUS adequate mechanisms to ensure the full and timely repayment of the loan, as determined by RUS.


(5) The Administrator may modify the accounting requirements for RESP borrowers if, in his or her judgement, it is necessary to satisfy the statutory purpose of the program, streamline procedures, or advance policy goals.


(6) Nothing in this policy shall be construed as a limitation or waiver of any other federal statute or requirement or the Administrator's authority and discretion to implement the RESP in such a way that the Government's interest is adequately preserved.


(b) *Auditing requirements.* RESP borrowers will be required to prepare audits as follows:


(1) If the borrower is a for-profit entity, an electric or telecommunications cooperative, or any other entity not covered by the definition of “non-Federal entity” in 2 CFR 200.1, the borrower shall provide an independent audit report in accordance with 7 CFR part 1773 and the award agreement. The certified public accountant (CPA) is selected by the awardee and must be approved by RUS as set forth in 7 CFR 1773.5.


(2) If the borrower is a non-Federal entity, as defined in 2 CFR 200.1, the borrower shall provide an audit in accordance with subpart F of 2 CFR part 200.


(3) RESP borrowers must comply with all reasonable RUS requests to support ongoing monitoring efforts. The RESP borrowers must afford RUS, through their representatives, a reasonable opportunity, at all times during business hours and upon prior notice, to have access to and the right to inspect any or all books, records, accounts, invoices, contracts, leases, payrolls, timesheets, cancelled checks, statements, and other documents, electronic or paper of every kind belonging to or in possession of the RESP borrowers or in any way pertaining to its property or business, including its parents, affiliates, and subsidiaries, if any, and to make copies or extracts therefrom.


(4) The Administrator may modify the audit requirements for RESP borrowers if, in his or her judgement, it is necessary to satisfy the statutory purpose of the program or advance policy goals.


(5) Nothing in this policy shall be construed as a limitation or waiver of any other federal statute or requirement or the Administrator's authority and discretion to implement the RESP in such a way that the Government's interest is adequately preserved.
