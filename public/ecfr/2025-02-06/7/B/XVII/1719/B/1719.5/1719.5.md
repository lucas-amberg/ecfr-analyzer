# ยง 1719.5   Application process and required information.

(a) *General.* The following are general provisions for the application process:


(1) The RUS, from time to time and subject to appropriations, will notify the public specifying funding priorities, funding availability, and deadlines.


(2) Complete applications for loans to Eligible entities will be processed pursuant to the provisions in this Part and on a first-come-first served basis until the funding appropriated to the program is fully obligated.


(3) The submittal of a Letter of Intent is required to participate in the program. The letters of intent will be queued as they are received. If it advances program and policy goals, RUS may consider loan applications from Eligible entities that have submitted Letters of Intent under prior funding announcements but that were not invited to proceed with a loan application.


(4) Upon review of the Letter of Intent, RUS may issue an Invitation to proceed with a loan application. RUS reserves the right to notify the Applicant in the queue that the amount of financing RUS will consider for a loan is below the level sought in the Letter of Intent. In making this consideration, RUS will consider overall RUS program objectives or budgetary constraints. An Invitation to proceed with the loan application issued by RUS is not to be deemed as an offer by RUS.


(5) A RESP applicant will have up to ninety (90) days to complete the documentation for a complete loan application. The ninety (90) day timeframe will begin on the date the RESP applicant receives RUS' Invitation to proceed. If the deadline to submit the completed loan application falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a Federal holiday, the application is due the next business day.


(6) The Administrator may grant an extension of time to complete the documentation required for an application if, in the Administrator's sole judgment, the interest of the program would be advanced by the extension.


(7) RUS may limit the number of applications it will consider in the same funding cycle from the same Applicant or combine applications from a single entity.

The financial forecast and related projections submitted in support of a loan application must include:

(*4*) A full explanation of the assumptions, supporting data, and analysis used in the forecast, including the methodology used to project revenues, operating expenses, and any other factors having a material effect on the balance sheet and the financial ratios such as equity and debt service coverage.

The RESP applicant should also include the target penetration rates by market segment and expected investments in marketing the relending program. In doing so, it is expected that racial and ethnic demographics for the service area would be provided.


(*2*) The RESP applicant will describe the activities and investments (list of EE measures) to be implemented in the EE Program and the expected energy savings.

It is also expected that a description of the process for documenting and perfecting collateral arrangements with Qualified Consumers, when applicable, be also included in the narrative.


(*iv*) The RESP applicant will also identify the staff that will be carrying out the EE Program and will describe the tasks that will be performed by such individuals together with their expertise and credentials. Should the RESP applicant decide to outsource implementation of the EE Program, the credentials and expertise of the third party implementing the outsourced tasks must be described. Consideration must be given to the third party's ability and expertise in implementing an EE Program at the scale pursued with the RESP funding. The statement of qualifications must show the party's experience carrying out the financial and technical components of an EE Program at the desired scale. A RESP applicant with an existing EE Program as of April 8, 2014, may submit the IWP plan previously established to fulfill this requirement.
