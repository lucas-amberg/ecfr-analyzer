# ยง 1721.101   General.

(a) The procedures in this subpart are intended to provide Borrowers with the flexibility to request an extension of principal and interest as authorized under section 12(a) of the RE Act and section 236 of the Disaster Relief Act of 1970 (Public Law 91-606). 


(b) The total amount of interest that has been deferred, including interest on deferred principal, will be added to the principal balance, and the total amount of principal and interest that has been deferred will be reamortized over the remaining life of the applicable note beginning in the first year the deferral period ends.


(c) Payment of principal and interest will not be extended more than 5 years after such payment is due as originally scheduled. However, in cases where the extension is being granted because, at the sole discretion of the Administrator, a severe hardship has been experienced, the Administrator may grant a longer extension provided that the maturity date of any such loan does not extend to a date beyond forty (40) years from the date of the note.
