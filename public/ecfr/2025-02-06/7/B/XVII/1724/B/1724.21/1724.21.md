# ยง 1724.21   Architectural services contracts.

The provisions of this section apply only to RUS financed electric system facilities.


(a) RUS Form 220, Architectural Services Contract, may be used by electric borrowers when obtaining architectural services.


(b) The borrower shall ensure that the architect furnishes or obtains all architectural services related to the design and construction management of the facilities.


(c) Reasonable modifications or additions to the terms and conditions in the RUS contract form may be made to define the exact services needed for a specific undertaking. Such modifications or additions shall not relieve the architect or the borrower of the basic responsibilities required by the RUS contract form, and shall not alter any terms and conditions required by law. All substantive changes must be approved by RUS prior to execution of the contract.


(d) Architectural services contracts are not subject to RUS approval and need not be submitted to RUS unless specifically requested by RUS on a case by case basis.


(e) *Closeout.* Upon completion of all services and obligations required under each architectural services contract, including, but not limited to, submission of final documents, the borrower must closeout that contract. The borrower shall obtain from the architect a final statement of cost, which must be supported by detailed information as appropriate. For example, out-of-pocket expense and per diem types of compensation should be listed separately with labor, transportation, etc., itemized for each service involving these types of compensation. RUS Form 284, Final Statement of Cost for Architectural Service, may be used. All computations of the compensation must be made in accordance with the terms of the architectural services contract. Closeout documents need not be submitted to RUS unless specifically requested by RUS on a case by case basis.
