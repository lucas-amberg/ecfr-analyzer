This subpart prescribes RUS procedures in promulgating electric program standard contract forms and identifies those forms that borrowers are required to use.


(b) *Contract forms.* RUS promulgates standard contract forms, identified in the List of Required Contract Forms, ยง 1724.74(c), that borrowers are required to use in accordance with the provisions of this part. A borrower may deviate from the Required Contract Form provided the borrower certifies to RUS that the non-standard form incorporates the provisions of the Required Contract Form that are contained in the RUS Certification Form found at *https://www.rd.usda.gov/resources/directives/electric-sample-documents.* Further, a borrower may utilize a contract other than a Required Contract Form if it is allowed to do so by an indenture or any other agreement between the borrower and RUS. In addition, RUS promulgates standard contract forms identified in the List of Guidance Contract Forms contained in ยง 1724.74(c) that the borrowers may but are not required to use in the planning, design, and construction of their electric systems. Borrowers are not required to use these guidance contract forms in the absence of an agreement to do so.
