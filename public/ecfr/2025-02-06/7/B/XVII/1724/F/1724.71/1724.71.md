# § 1724.71   Borrower contractual obligations.

(a) *Loan agreement.* As a condition of a loan or loan guarantee under the RE Act, distribution borrowers are normally required to enter into RUS loan agreements pursuant to which the borrower agrees to use RUS standard forms of contracts for construction, procurement, engineering services and architectural services financed in whole or in part by the RUS loan. Normally, this obligation is contained in section 5.16 of the standard distribution loan contract. To comply with the provisions of the loan agreements as implemented by this part, borrowers must use those forms of contract (hereinafter sometimes called “listed contract forms”) identified in the List of Required Standard Contract Forms contained in § 1724.74(c), except as provided in § 1724.70(b). Power Supply borrowers typically execute an indenture and loan contract as well. The terms and conditions of any indenture and loan contract executed by a Power Supply borrower shall govern its obligations with respect to the use of contract forms.


(b) *Compliance.* If a borrower is required by this part or by its loan agreement with RUS to use a listed standard form of contract, the borrower shall use the listed contract form in the format available from RUS, either paper or electronic format, except as provided in § 1724.70(bc). Exact electronic reproduction is acceptable. The approved RUS standard forms of contract shall not be retyped, changed, modified, or altered in any manner not specifically authorized in this part or approved by RUS in writing on a case-by-case basis. Any modifications approved by RUS on a case-by-case basis must be clearly shown so as to indicate the modification difference from the standard form of contract. 


(c) *Amendment.* Where a borrower has entered into a contract in the form required by this part, no change may be made in the terms of the contract, by amendment, waiver or otherwise, without the prior written approval of RUS except as provided in § 1724.70(b).


(d) *Waiver.* RUS may waive for good cause, on a case by case basis, the requirements imposed on a borrower pursuant to this part. Borrowers seeking a waiver by RUS must provide RUS with a written request explaining the need for the waiver.


(e) *Violations.* A failure on the part of the borrower to use listed contracts as prescribed in this part is a violation of the terms of its loan agreement with RUS and RUS may exercise any and all remedies available under the terms of the agreement or otherwise.
