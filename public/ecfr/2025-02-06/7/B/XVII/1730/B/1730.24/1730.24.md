# ยง 1730.24   RUS review and evaluation.

RUS will initiate and conduct a periodic review and evaluation of the operations and maintenance practices of each borrower for the purpose of assessing loan security and determining borrower compliance with RUS policy as outlined in this part. This review will normally be done at least once every four years for all Borrowers. The borrower will make available to RUS the borrower's policies, procedures, and records related to the operations and maintenance of its complete system. Reports made by other inspectors (*e.g.,* other Federal agencies, State inspectors, etc.) will also be made available, as applicable. RUS will not duplicate these other reviews but will use their reports to supplement its own review. RUS may inspect facilities, as well as records, and may also observe construction and maintenance work in the field. Key borrower personnel responsible for the facilities being inspected are to accompany RUS during such inspections, unless otherwise determined by RUS. RUS personnel may prepare an independent summary of the operations and maintenance practices of the borrower. The borrower's management will discuss this review and evaluation with its Board of Directors.
