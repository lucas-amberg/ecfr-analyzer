# § 1738.204   Evaluation for feasibility.

After a loan or loan/grant combination Applicant is notified that the application is complete, the Agency will evaluate the application's financial and technical feasibility. Only applications that, as determined by the Agency, are technically and financially feasible will be considered for funding.


(a) The Agency will determine financial feasibility by evaluating the impact of the facilities financed with the proceeds of the loan and the associated debt, the Applicant's equity, competitive analysis, financial information—including the Applicant's ability to meet the Agency's Net worth and TIER, DSCR, or CR requirements in § 1738.206(b)(2)(i)—and other relevant information in the application.


(b) The Agency will determine technical feasibility by evaluating the Applicant's network design and other relevant information in the application.
