# ยง 1752.18   Sale of the note.

In the event of one or more incidents of default by the Borrower that cannot or will not be cured within a reasonable period of time, the Agency may sell the note. A decision to sell the note may be made when the Agency determines that the monetary default cannot be cured through the other actions as outlined in this part, or it has been determined that it is in the best interest of the Agency. The decision to sell the note should be made as soon as possible when one or more of the following exist:


(a) A loan is 90 days behind on any scheduled payment and the Agency and Borrower have not been able to cure the delinquency through actions such as those contained in this part;


(b) It is determined that delaying sale of the note will jeopardize full recovery on the loan; or


(c) The Borrower is uncooperative in resolving the delinquency or the Agency has reason to believe the Borrower is not acting in good faith, and it would improve the position of the Agency to sell the note immediately.
