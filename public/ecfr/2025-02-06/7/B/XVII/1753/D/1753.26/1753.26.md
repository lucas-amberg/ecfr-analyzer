(a) For headquarters and commercial office buildings only, the borrower shall prepare preliminary P&S showing the floor plan and general architectural details of the building to be constructed using loan funds. In particular, the preliminary P&S shall address the requirements of § 1753.25(f) and the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. 4601 *et seq.*). The P&S shall be submitted to the GFR and are subject to RUS approval.

(1) RUS Contract Form 257, Contract to Construct Buildings, completed to the extent explained in (c) of this section.


(2) Complete and detailed specifications covering materials and workmanship. 


(3) A detailed building plan. Where the building is to house electronic apparatus, the detailed plan or specifications shall include the equipment environmental requirements and special equipment required. 


(4) A site plan for each building showing the building location and giving the legal description of the site. Sufficient information must be provided for the site so that it can be identified as the same property on which title opinion was submitted to RUS. The legal description shall be typed on the site plan. The borrower shall also furnish topographical information and a description of any proposed site development work and show proposed connections for public utilities. 


(c) RUS Contract Form 257 shall be completed as follows: 


(1) *List of names or kinds of buildings and locations*—Site plan and specifications must be identified with the appropriate building. 


(2) *Alternates*—The borrower shall keep the number of alternates to a minimum. Items for which alternates are to be taken shall be fully described on a separate sheet in the specifications and the details shown on the plans, when necessary, and identified by the alternate number. The Notice and Instructions to Bidders shall explain how bids will be evaluated with respect to alternates. 


(3) *Time for construction*—A reasonable time for completion of construction, considering local conditions, shall be determined by the borrower and inserted in the space provided. Too short a construction period may discourage bidders or influence their bids. Completion of the building, where central office equipment is involved, shall be coordinated with delivery of the equipment. The time of completion shall allow adequate drying time before the central office equipment is stored or installed in the building. 


(d) The plans and specifications shall show the identification and date of the model code used for seismic safety design considerations, and the seismic factor used. See 7 CFR part 1792, subpart C.
