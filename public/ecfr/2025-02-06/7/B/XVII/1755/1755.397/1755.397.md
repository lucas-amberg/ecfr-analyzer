The failure rate for the equipment shall be less than 0.5 percent per month of all equipped cards in all system terminals after 6 months. A failure is considered to be the failure of a component on the PC board which requires it to be repaired or replaced.


(2) The line concentrator terminal units shall be designed such that there will be no more than 4 hours of total outages in 20 years.


(d) *System type acceptance tests.* General test results will be required on each system type. Any system provided in accordance with this section shall be capable of meeting any requirement in this section on a spot-check basis.


(e) *Features required.* The network control equipment and peripheral equipment shall be comprised of solid-state and integrated circuitry components as far as practical and in keeping with the state-of-the-art and economics of the subject system.


(f) *Subscriber lines*—(1) *General.* (i) The remote LC units shall operate satisfactorily with subscriber lines which meet all of the conditions under the bidder's specifications and all the requirements of this section. This section recognizes that the loop limit of the line concentrator is dependent upon the transmission facility between the LC central office termination and the LC remote unit. When voice frequency (physical) circuits are used, the loop limit from the COE to the subscriber shall be 1900 ohms (including the telephone set). When electronically derived circuits (carrier, lightwave, etc.) are used, the loop limits of the electronic system will control. The bidder shall identify the loop limits of the equipment to be supplied.

(3) *Ringing.* (i) When LC ringing is generated at the remote end, it shall be automatic and intermittent and shall be cut off from the called line upon removal of the handset at the called station during either the ringing or silent period.


(ii) When ringing generators are provided in the LC on an ancillary basis, they shall be accepted or technically accepted by RUS.


(iii) Where ringing is generated at the remote end, the ringing system shall provide sufficient ringing on a bridged basis over the voltage and temperature limits of this specification and over subscriber loops within the limits stated by the manufacturer. The manufacturer shall state the minimum number (not less than two) of main station ringers that can be used for each ringing option available.


(g) *Traffic.* (1)(i) The minimum grade of service for traffic in the line concentrator shall be B =. 005 using the Traffic Table, based on the Erlang Lost-Calls-Cleared Formula. Required grade of service, traffic assumptions and calculations for the particular application being implemented shall be supplied by the bidder.


(ii) Service to customers served by a traffic sensitive LC should not be noticeably different than the service to customers served by the dedicated physical pairs from the central office so that uniform grade of service will be provided to all customers in any class of service. Reference § 1755.522(p)(1)(i), RUS General Specification for Digital, Stored Program Controlled Central Office Equipment.


(2) *Traffic and Plant Registers.* Traffic measurements consist of three types—peg count, usage, and congestion. A peg count register scores one count per call attempt per circuit group such as trunks, digit receivers, senders, etc. Usage counters measure the traffic density in networks, trunks and other circuit groups. Congestion registers score the number of calls which fail to find an idle circuit in a trunk group or to find an idle path through the switching network when attempting to connect two given end points. These conditions constitute “network blocking.” 


(3) When required, traffic data will be stored in electronic storage registers or a block of memory consisting of one or more traffic counters for each item to be measured. The bidder shall indicate what registers are to be supplied, their purpose and the means for displaying the information locally (or at a remote location when available).


(h) *Transmission requirements*—(1) *General.* Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in paragraphs (h) (2) through (20) of this section are specified in terms of analog measurements made from Main Distributing Frame (MDF) terminals to MDF terminals excluding cabling loss.


(2) *Telephone transmitter battery supply.* A minimum of 20 milliamperes, dc, shall be provided for the transmitter of the telephone set at the subscriber station under all loop conditions specified by the bidder. The telephone set is assumed to have a resistance of 200 ohms.


(3) *Impedance—subscriber loops.* For the purpose of this section, the input impedance of all subscriber loops served by the equipment is arbitrarily considered to be 900 ohms in series with 2.16 microfarad capacitor at voice frequencies.


(4) *Battery noise.* Noise across the remote terminal battery at power panel distribution bus terminals shall not exceed 35 dBrnC during the specified busy hour.


(5) *Stability.* The long-term allowable variation in loss through the line concentrator system shall be ±0.5 dB from the loss specified by the bidder.

Two-wire ports are measured at 900 ohms in series with 2.16 microfarads, and 4-wire ports are measured at 600 ohms resistive. When other balance networks are supplied, test equipment arranged for operation with the supplied network(s) may be used. The requirement given shall meet the following cited values on each balance network available in the system:


(7) *Longitudinal balance.* The minimum longitudinal balance, with dc loop currents between 20 to 70 mA, shall be 60 dB at all frequencies between 60 and 2000 Hz, 55 dB at 2700 Hz and 50 dB at 3400 Hz.

A WILCOM T-194C Transmission Test Set, or equivalent, should be used for the measurements. The measurement shall be made by establishing a normal connection from the noise counter through the switching equipment in its off-hook condition to a quiet termination of 900 ohms impedance. Office battery and signaling circuit wiring shall be suitably segregated from voice and carrier circuit wiring, and frame talking battery filters provided, if and as required, in order to meet these impulse noise limits.


(11) *Crosstalk coupling.* Worst case equal level crosstalk shall be 65 dB minimum in the range 200 to 3400 Hz. This shall be measured between any two paths through the system by connecting a 0 dBm0 level tone to the disturbing pair.

8 bits averaged over a 5-minute period, excluding the least significant bit.


(13) *Quantizing distortion.* (i) The system shall meet the following requirements:

Systems operated with a (VF) line circuit interface may introduce up to 3 dB insertion loss. Reference § 1755.522(q)(3).


(20) *Detailed requirements for direct digital connections.* (i) This paragraph (h)(20) covers the detailed requirements for the provision of interface units which will permit direct digital connection between the host central office and line concentrator subscriber terminals over digital facilities. The digital transmission system shall be compatible with T1 type span lines using a DS1 interface and other digital interfaces that may be specified by the owner. The RUS specification for the T1 span line equipment is PE-60. Other span line techniques may also be used. Diverse span line routing may be used when specified by the owner.


(ii) The output of a digital-to-digital port shall be Pulse Code Modulation (PCM), encoded in eight-bit words using the mu-255 encoding law and D3 encoding format, and arranged to interface with a T1 span line.

Sufficient system alarm points shall be provided from the remote terminal to report conditions to the central office alarm system. The alarms shall be transmitted from the remote terminal to the central office terminal as long as any part of the connecting link is available for this transmission. Fuses shall be of the alarm and indicator type, and their rating designated by numerals or color code on fuse positions.


(j) *Electrical protection*—(1) *Surge protection.* (i) Adequate electrical protection of line concentrator equipment shall be included in the design of the system. The characteristics and application of protection devices must be such that they enable the line concentrator equipment to withstand, without damage or excessive protector maintenance, the dielectric stresses and currents that are produced in line-to-ground and tip-to-ring circuits through the equipment as a result of induced or conducted lightning or power system fault-related surges. All wire terminals connected to outside plant wire or cable pairs shall be protected from voltage and current surges.


(ii) Equipment must pass laboratory tests, simulating a hostile electrical environment, before being placed in the field for the purpose of obtaining field experience. For acceptance consideration RUS requires manufacturers to submit recently completed results (within 90 days of submittal) of data obtained from the prescribed testing. Manufacturers are expected to detail how data and tests were conducted. There are five basic types of laboratory tests which must be applied to exposed terminals in an effort to determine if the equipment will survive. Figure 2 of this section, Summary of Electrical Requirements and Tests, identifies the tests and their application as follows:


(iii) Electrical protection requirements for line concentrator equipment can be summarized briefly as follows:


(A) Current surge tests simulate the stress to which a relatively low impedance path may be subjected before main frame protectors break down. Paths with a 100 Hz impedance of 50 ohms or less shall be subjected to current surges, employing a 10 × 1000 microsecond waveshape as defined in Figure 3 of this section, Surge Waveshape. For the purpose of determining this impedance, arresters which are mounted within the equipment are to be considered zero impedance. The crest current shall not exceed 500A; however, depending on the impedance of the test specimen this value of current may be lower. The crest current through the sample, multiplied by the sample's 100 Hz impedance, shall not exceed 1000 V. Where sample impedance is less than 2 ohms, peak current shall be limited to 500A as shown in Figure 4 of this section, Current Surge Tests. Figures 3 and 4 follow:


(B) Sixty Hertz (60 Hz) current carrying tests shall be applied to simulate an ac power fault which is conducted to the unit over the cable pairs. The test shall be limited to 10 amperes Root Mean Square (rms) of 60 Hz ac for a period of 11 cycles (0.1835 seconds) and shall be applied longitudinally from line to ground.


(C) AC power service surge voltage tests shall be applied to the power input terminals of ac powered devices to simulate switching surges or lightning-induced transients on the ac power system. The test shall employ a 1.2 × 50 microsecond waveshape with a crest voltage of 2500 V. Communications line protectors may be left in place for these tests.


(D) Voltage surge tests which simulate the voltage stress to which a relatively high impedance path may be subjected before primary protectors break down and protect the circuit. To ensure coordination with the primary protection while reducing testing to the minimum, voltage surge tests shall be conducted at a 1000 volts with primary arresters removed for devices protected by carbon blocks, or the + 3 sigma dc breakdown voltage of other primary arresters. Surge waveshape should be 10 × 1000 microseconds.


(E) Arrester response delay tests are designed to stress the equipment in a manner similar to that caused by the delayed breakdown of gap type arresters when subjected to rapidly rising voltages. Arresters shall be removed for these tests, the peak surge voltage shall be the + 3 sigma breakdown voltage of the arrester in question on a voltage rising at 100 V per microsecond, and the time for the surge to decay to half voltage shall equal at least the delay time of the tube as explained in Figure 5 of this section, Arrester Response Delay Time as follows:


(iv) Tests shall be conducted in the following sequence. As not all tests are required in every application, non-applicable tests should be omitted:


(A) Current Impulse Test;


(B) Sixty Hertz (60 Hz) Current Carrying Tests;


(C) AC Power Service Impulse Voltage Test;


(D) Voltage Impulse Test; and


(E) Arrester Response Delay Time Test.


(v) A minimum of five applications of each polarity for the surge tests and three for the 60 Hz Current Carrying Tests are the minimum required. All tests shall be conducted with not more than 1 minute between consecutive applications in each series of three or five applications to a specific configuration so that heating effects will be cumulative. See Figure 6 of this section, 60 Hz Current Surge Tests as follows:


(vi) Tests shall be applied between each of the following terminal combinations for all line operating conditions:

(ii) Direct current potentials shall be applied between all line terminals and the equipment chassis and between these terminals and grounded equipment housings in all instances where the circuitry is dc open circuit from the chassis, or connected to the chassis through a capacitor. The duration of all dielectric strength tests shall be at least 1 second. The applied potential shall be at a minimum equal to the plus 3 sigma dc breakdown voltage of the arrester, provided by the line concentrator manufacturer.


(3) *Insulation resistance.* Following the dielectric tests, the insulation resistance of the installed electrical circuits between wires and ground, with the normal equipment grounds removed, shall not be less than 10 megohms at 500 volts dc at a temperature of 68 °F (20 °C) and at a relative humidity of approximately 50 percent. The measurement shall be made after the meter stabilizes, unless the requirement is met sooner. Arresters shall be removed for these tests.


(4) *Self-protection.* (i) All components shall be capable of being continuously energized at rated voltage without injury. Design precautions must be taken to prevent damage to other equipment components when a particular component fails.


(ii) Printed circuit boards or similar equipment employing electronic components should be self-protecting against external grounds applied to the connector terminals. Board components and coatings applied to finished products shall be of such material or so treated that they will not support combustion.
