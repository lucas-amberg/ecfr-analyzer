(2) *Capability tests.* Tests on a quality assurance basis shall be made as frequently as is required for each manufacturer to determine and maintain compliance with:


(i) Performance of the conductors;


(ii) Performance of the conductor insulation and jacket material;


(iii) Sequential marking and lettering;


(iv) Mutual capacitance, capacitance unbalance, attenuation, and crosstalk;


(v) Conductor resistance, resistance unbalance, and insulation resistance;


(vi) Dielectric strength and fusing coordination;


(vii) Impact, abrasion, static load, elongation, and plasticizer compatibility tests; and


(viii) Cold temperature handling, light absorption, low temperature separation, and flammability tests.


(c) *Summary of records of electrical and physical tests.* (1) Each manufacturer shall maintain suitable summary records for a period of at least 3 years of all electrical and physical tests required on completed wire as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. The test data for a particular lot of aerial service wire shall be in a form such that it may be readily available to the purchaser or to RUS upon request.


(2) Measurements and computed values shall be rounded off to the number of places or figures specified for the requirement according to ANSI/ICEA S-89-648-1993, paragraph 1.3.


(d) *Manufacturing irregularities.* (1) Repairs to the insulation of CCSR aerial service wires are not permitted in wires supplied to end users under §§ 1755.700 through 1755.704.


(2) Repairs to the jacket of NMR aerial service wires are not permitted in wires supplied to end users under §§ 1755.700 through 1755.704.


(e) *Splicing.* Splicing of completed CCSR and NMR aerial service wires shall comply with the requirement specified in ANSI/ICEA S-89-648-1993, paragraph 8.1.1.


(f) *Preparation for shipment.* (1) CCSR and NMR aerial service wire shall be shipped either in coils or on reels.


(2) When CCSR and NMR aerial service wires are shipped on reels the following provisions shall apply:


(i) The diameter of the drum shall be large enough to prevent damage to the wire from reeling or unreeling. The reels shall be substantial and so constructed as to prevent damage to the wire during shipment and handling;


(ii) A waterproof corrugated board or other suitable means of protection accepted by RUS prior to its use may be applied to the reel. If the waterproof corrugated board or other suitable material is used for protection, it shall be suitably secured in place to prevent damage to the wire during storage and handling. The use of the waterproof corrugated board or other suitable means of protection shall be at the option of the manufacturer unless specified by the end user;


(iii) The outer end of the wire shall be securely fastened to the reel head so as to prevent the wire from becoming loose in transit. The inner end of the wire shall be securely fastened in such a way as to make it readily available if required for electrical testing. Spikes, staples, or other fastening devices which penetrate the conductor insulation of the CCSR aerial service wire and the jacket of the NMR aerial service wire shall not be used. The method of fastening the wire ends shall be accepted by RUS prior to their use;


(iv) Each length of wire shall be wound on a separate reel;


(v) Each reel shall be plainly marked to indicate the direction in which it should be rolled to prevent loosening of the wire on the reel; and

(A) Customer order number;


(B) Manufacturer's name and product code;


(C) Factory reel number and year of manufacture;


(D) Gauge of conductors and pair size of wire;


(E) Length of wire; and


(F) RUS designation letter “K.”

(iii) The coils of wire shall be wound securely with strong tape in four separate evenly spaced places;


(iv) The coils may be protected from damage by wrapping the coil with heavy paper, burlap, or other suitable material accepted by RUS prior to its use. The use of the heavy paper, burlap, or other suitable means of protection shall be at the option of the manufacturer unless specified by the end user; and


(v) Each coil shall be tagged with the following information:
