If the second sample exhibits water leakage, the entire reel of wire is to be rejected. If the second sample exhibits no leakage, the entire reel of wire is considered acceptable.


(5) *Compound flow test.* The completed wire must be capable of meeting the compound flow test specified in ASTM D 4565-90a when exposed for a period of 24 hours at a temperature of 80 ±1 °C. At the end of this test period, there must be no evidence of flowing or dripping of compound from either the core or sheath interfaces.


(o) *Acceptance testing and extent of testing.* (1) The tests described in appendix A of this section are intended for acceptance of wire designs and major modifications of accepted designs. RUS decides what constitutes a major modification. These tests are intended to show the inherent capability of the manufacturer to produce wire products having long life and stability.


(2) For initial acceptance, the manufacturer must submit:


(i) An original signature certification that the product fully complies with each requirement of this section; 


(ii) Qualification Test Data, per appendix A of this section;


(iii) To periodic plant inspections;


(iv) A certification that the product does or does not comply with the domestic origin manufacturing provisions of the “Buy American” requirements of the Rural Electrification Act of 1938 (7 U.S.C. 901 *et seq.*);


(v) Written user testimonials concerning performance of the product; and


(vi) Other nonproprietary data deemed necessary by the Chief, Outside Plant Branch (Telephone).


(3) For requalification acceptance, the manufacturer must submit an original signature certification that the product fully complies with each section of the specification, excluding the Qualification Section, and a certification that the product does or does not comply with the domestic origin manufacturing provisions of the “Buy American” requirements of the Rural Electrification Act of 1938 (7 U.S.C. 901 *et seq.*) for acceptance by June 30 every three years. The required data and certification must have been gathered within 90 days of the submission.


(4) Initial and requalification acceptance requests should be addressed to: Chairman, Technical Standards, Committee “A” (Telephone), Telecommunications Standards Division, Rural Utilities Service, Washington, DC 20250-1500.


(5) Tests on 100 percent of completed wire. (i) The shield of each length of wire must be tested for continuity using the procedures of ASTM D 4566-90.


(ii) Dielectric strength between all conductors and the shield must be tested to determine freedom from grounds in accordance with paragraph (m)(7)(ii) of this section.


(iii) Each conductor in the completed wire must be tested for continuity using the procedures of ASTM D 4566-90.


(iv) Dielectric strength between conductors must be tested to ensure freedom from shorts and crosses in accordance with paragraph (m)(7)(i) of this section.


(v) The average mutual capacitance must be measured on all wires.


(6) *Capability tests.* Tests on a quality assurance basis must be made as frequently as is required for each manufacturer to determine and maintain compliance with:


(i) Performance requirements for conductor insulation and jacket material;


(ii) Performance requirements for filling and flooding compounds;


(iii) Sequential marking and lettering;


(iv) Capacitance unbalance and crosstalk;


(v) Insulation resistance;


(vi) Conductor resistance and resistance unbalance;


(vii) Wire bending and wire breaking strength tests;


(viii) Mutual conductance and attenuation; and


(ix) Water penetration and compound flow tests.


(p) *Summary of records of electrical and physical tests.* (1) Each manufacturer must maintain suitable summary of records for a period of at least 3 years for all electrical and physical tests required on completed wire by this section as set forth in paragraphs (o)(5) and (o)(6) of this section. The test data for a particular reel shall be in a form that it may be readily available to the purchaser or to RUS upon request.


(2) Measurements and computed values must be rounded off to the number of places of figures specified for the requirement according to ASTM E 29-90.


(q) *Manufacturing irregularities.* (1) Repairs to the inner jacket and shield are not permitted in wire supplied to the end user under this section.


(2) Minor defects in the outer jackets (defects having a dimension of 3 mm (0.125 in.) or less in any direction) may be repaired by means of heat fusing in accordance with good commercial practices utilizing sheath grade compound.


(r) *Preparation for shipment.* (1) The wire must be shipped on reels. The diameter of the drum must be large enough to prevent damage to the wire from reeling or unreeling. The reels must be substantial and so constructed as to prevent damage to the wire during shipment and handling.


(2) The thermal wrap must comply with the requirements of appendix C of this section. When a thermal reel wrap is supplied, the wrap must be applied to the reel and must be suitably secured in place to minimize thermal exposure to the wire during storage and shipment. The use of the thermal reel wrap as a means of reel protection will be at the option of the manufacturer unless specified by the end user.


(3) The outer end of the wire must be securely fastened to the reel head so as to prevent the wire from becoming loose in transit. The inner end of the wire must be securely fastened in such a way as to make it readily available if required for electrical testing. Spikes, staples, or other fastening devices which penetrate the wire jacket must not be used. The method of fastening the wire ends must be accepted by RUS prior to it being used.


(4) Each length of wire must be wound on a separate reel unless otherwise specified or agreed to by the purchaser.


(5) Each reel must be plainly marked to indicate the direction in which it should be rolled to prevent loosening of the wire on the reel.


(6) Each reel must be stenciled or labeled on either one or both sides with the name of the manufacturer, year of manufacture, actual shipping length, an inner and outer end sequential length marking, description of the wire, reel number and the RUS wire designation:


(7) Both ends of the filled buried wire, manufactured to the requirements of this section, must be equipped with end caps which are acceptable to RUS.
