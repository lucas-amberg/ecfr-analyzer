The expense accounts shall be maintained by the following subsidiary record categories, as appropriate to each account. Such subsidiary record categories shall be reported as required by 47 CFR part 43.


(a) *Salaries and wages.* This subsidiary record category shall include compensation to employees, such as wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, incentive awards, and termination payments.


(b) *Benefits.* This subsidiary record category shall include payroll related benefits on behalf of employees such as the following:


(1) Pensions;


(2) Savings plan contributions (company portion);


(3) Worker's compensation required by law;


(4) Life, hospital, medical, dental, and vision plan insurance, and


(5) Social Security and other payroll taxes.


(c) *Rents.* (1) This subsidiary record category shall include amounts paid for the use of real and personal operating property. Amounts paid for real property shall be included in Account 6121, Land and Buildings Expense. This category includes payments for operating leases but does not include payments for capital leases.


(2) This subsidiary record category is applicable only to the Plant Specific Operations Expense accounts. Incidental rents, e.g., short-term rental car expense, shall be categorized as Other Expenses (see paragraph (d) of this section) under the account which reflects the function for which the incidental rent was incurred.


(d) *Other expenses.* This subsidiary record category shall include costs which cannot be classified to the other subsidiary record categories. Included are material and supplies, including provisioning (*note also* Account 6512, Provisioning Expense); contracted services; accident and damage payments, insurance premiums; traveling expenses and other miscellaneous costs.


(e) *Clearances.* This subsidiary record category shall include amounts transferred to Construction accounts (*see* 47 CFR 32.2000(c)(2)(iii)), other Plant Specific Operations Expense accounts and/or Account 3100, Accumulated Depreciation (cost of removal; *see* 47 CFR 32.2000(g)(1)(iii)), as appropriate, from Accounts 6112, Motor Vehicles Expense, 6114, Tools and Other Work Equipment Expense, 6534, Plant Operations and Administration Expense, and 6535, Engineering Expense. There shall also be transfers to Construction or other Plant Specific Operations Expense accounts, as appropriate, from Account 6512, Provisioning Expense. With respect to these expenses, companies may establish such clearing accounts as they deem necessary to accomplish substantially the same results, provided that within thirty (30) days of the opening of such accounts, companies shall notify the FCC of the nature and purpose thereof. Additional clearing accounts affecting other expense areas may be established with prior approval of the FCC. Should companies elect, the initial incurred subsidiary record category identification may be carried through to the final accounts without FCC approval.
