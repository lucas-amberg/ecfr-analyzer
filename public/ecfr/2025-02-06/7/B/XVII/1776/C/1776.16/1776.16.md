(a) If RUS determines that DWS loans may be serviced by CSC, then the grant recipient will enter into an agreement with the Centralized Servicing Center for servicing all DWS loans made from the revolving loan fund. All DWS loan payments will be received by and processed at the Centralized Servicing Center. The grant recipient will be charged a fee for this service, and such fee should be included in the projected financial statements and work plan submitted as part of the grant application. This fee may be reimbursed as an administrative expense as provided in ยง 1776.13.


(b) If RUS determines that CSC is not able to service DWS loans, then the grant recipient shall be responsible for servicing, or causing to be serviced, all DWS loans. Servicing will include preparing loan agreements, processing loan payments, reviewing financial statements and debt reserves balances, and other responsibilities such as enforcement of loan terms. Loan servicing will be in accordance with the work plan RUS approved when the grant was awarded. It will continue as long as any loan made in whole or in part with RUS grant funds is outstanding.
