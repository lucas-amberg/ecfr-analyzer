# ยง 1780.48   Regional commission grants.

Grants are sometimes made by regional commissions for projects eligible for RUS assistance. RUS has agreed to administer such funds in a manner similar to administering RUS assistance.


(a) When RUS has funds in the project, no charge will be made for administering regional commission funds.


(b) When RUS has no loan or grant funds in the project, an administrative charge will be made pursuant to the Economy Act of 1932 (31 U.C.S. 1535). A fee of 5 percent of the first $100,000 of a regional commission grant and 1 percent of any amount over $100,000 will be paid to RUS by the commission.


(1) *Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC).* RUS Bulletin 1780-23 will be followed in determining the responsibilities of RUS. The ARC Federal Co-chairman and the State program official will provide each other with the necessary notification and certification.


(2) *Other regional commissions.* Title V of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3121 *et seq.*) authorizes other commissions similar to ARC. RUS Bulletin 1780-23 will be used to develop a separate project management agreement between RUS and the commission for each project. The agreement should be prepared by the State program official as soon as notification is received that a commission grant will be made and the amount is confirmed.


(c) Regional commission grants should be obligated as soon as possible in accordance with ยง 1780.41, except that the announcement procedure referred to in RUS Staff Instruction 1780-2 is not applicable. Regional commission grants will be disbursed from the Finance Office in the same manner as RUS funds.
