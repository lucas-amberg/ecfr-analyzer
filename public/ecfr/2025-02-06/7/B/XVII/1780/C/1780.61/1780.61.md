Contract documents must be sufficiently descriptive and legally binding in order to accomplish the work as economically and expeditiously as possible.


(a) *Standard construction contract documents.* If the construction contract documents utilized are not in the format previously approved by the Agency, OGC's review of the construction contract documents will be obtained prior to their use.


(b) *Contract review and concurrence.* The owner's attorney will review the executed contract documents, including performance and payment bonds, and will certify that they are adequate, and that the persons executing these documents have been properly authorized to do so. The contract documents, engineer's recommendation for award, and bid tabulation sheets will be forwarded to the Agency for concurrence prior to awarding the contract. All contracts will contain a provision that they are not effective until they have been concurred in by the Agency. The State program official or designee is responsible for concurring in construction contracts with the legal advice and guidance of the OGC when necessary.
