(a) If a maturing installment on an RUS note or a note which has been guaranteed by RUS is not received by its due date, funds will be withdrawn from the borrower's cushion of credit account and applied as of the installment due date beginning with the oldest of such notes as follows: first, to current interest then due on all notes; second, to the accumulated interest due, if any, on all notes; and third, to the principal then due on all notes.


(b) A borrower may reduce the balance of its cushion of credit account only if the amount obtained from the reduction is used to make scheduled payments on loans made or guaranteed under the Act.


(c) The Administrator of RUS may, consistent with law, authorize the requested release of cushion of credit deposits to a borrower when the cushion of credit balance will exceed the total value of the borrower's outstanding loans made or guaranteed by RUS.


(d) Once the balance in an individual cushion of credit account reaches zero, that cushion of credit account shall be closed. Once balances in all cushion of credit accounts reach zero, the cushion of credit program will be terminated.


(e) As the Rural Utilities Service phases out the cushion of credit program, the Agency may from time to time publish announcements in the _Federal Register,_ or on its website related to the efficient administration of the cushion of credit program.
