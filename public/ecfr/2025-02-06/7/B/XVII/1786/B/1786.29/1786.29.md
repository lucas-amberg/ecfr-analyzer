# § 1786.29   Prepayment authority, program allocations, categories of prepayment applications and financially distressed borrowers' reserve.

(a) *Prepayment Authority.* So long as the aggregate amount of prepayments made after December 22, 1987, including prepayments made pursuant to § 1786.28(d) and § 1786.28(e), under section 306(A) of the RE Act, does not exceed $2.5 billion, the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury is not required in order to make a prepayment pursuant to this subpart (such amount of prepayments is hereinafter called prepayment authority).


(b) *Program Allocations.* In accordance with the provisions of section 637 of the 1989 Appropriations Act, $350 million of prepayment authority is allocated to RUS-financed electric systems and $150 million of prepayment authority is allocated to RUS-financed telephone utilities. The amounts of prepayment authority allocated to electric program borrowers and telephone program borrowers shall not be transferred between programs. Borrowers may not sell, assign, or otherwise transfer prepayment authority to another borrower.


(c) *Categories of Prepayment Applications.* Applications received by RUS from borrowers desiring to prepay pursuant to this subpart will be separated into the following two application categories:


(1) *Electric Program Applications.* Electric program applications are applications to make a prepayment pursuant to this subpart from RUS-financed electric utilities, that qualify in accordance with § 1786.28(a) hereof and which are received by RUS during the application period. Electric program applications will be further subdivided and classified as being either (i) a financially distressed borrower's application, or (ii) a standard electric program application. Applications received from borrowers determined by the Administrator not to be a financially distressed borrower will be classified and processed as a standard electric program application;


(2) *Telephone Program Applications.* Telephone program applications are applications to make a prepayment pursuant to this subpart from RUS-financed telephone utilities that qualify in accordance with § 1786.28(a) hereof and which are received by RUS during the application period;


(d) *Financially distressed borrowers' reserve.* The $350 million of prepayment authority allocated for RUS-financed electric utilities, is initially set aside into a financially distressed borrowers' reserve. This reserve of prepayment authority will be available for prepayments pursuant to this subpart by financially distressed borrowers who apply to make such a prepayment during the application period. In the event that a portion of financially distressed borrowers' reserve remains unsubscribed at the end of the initial application period, the unallocated portion of the financially distressed borrowers' reserve will be allocated to other electric borrowers having submitted applications during an application period to be announced by RUS. Such prepayment applications shall be classified as standard electric program applications.
