# ยง 1786.203   Special considerations.

Generally all FFB borrowers with loans guaranteed by RUS whose FFB notes have not been accelerated are eligible to prepay or refinance under this part. All requests for prepayment or refinancing will be processed in accordance with this subpart except that some requests for refinancing and prepayments are more complicated and thus will involve special considerations. These requests will have to be handled on a case by case basis and include: 


(a) Telephone borrowers who are required to meet certain terms of their indenture; 


(b) Borrowers who have amended their old form note or have already repriced prior to September 30, 1993; 


(c) Borrowers that have been involved in a merger or consolidation; 


(d) Borrowers whose obligations to RUS, FFB notes, or security instruments differ from those normally used; 


(e) A request to prepay or refinance an amount of less than $100,000 or an amount of less than the full amount of an advance outstanding; or 


(f) A request to prepay or refinance a note that includes unadvanced loan funds.
