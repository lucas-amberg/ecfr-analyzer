(a) When properties of significant HA value are discovered during construction, the State Director will immediately consult with the applicant, the SHPO and the Regional Director of the National Park Service to determine whether there is sufficient factual evidence to warrant a decision to stop construction and undertake detailed survey and recovery.


(b) When the consultations in paragraph (a) of this section result in a determination by the National Park Service to request the applicant to stop construction, such stop action should be taken so that the Park Service can initiate measures for immediate recovery within 60 days after notification of a discovery.


(c) When the consultations in paragraph (a) of this section do not result in a determination by the National Park Service to stop construction and to undertake a survey and recovery, construction should be permitted to proceed with caution. In the event that the National Park Service determines that recovery is necessary, the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 applicant/borrower and the Park Service should determine that the consent of all persons, associations, or public entities having legal interests in the property involved has been secured. Also, the applicant should be informed that the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to compensate any person, association, or public entity damaged as a result of delay in construction or as a result of the temporary loss of the use of public or any nonfederally owned land.


(d) No survey or recovery work will be required which in the determination of the State Director would seriously impede FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 actions in providing assistance where the State Director determines that immediate action is required to avoid loss or damage of life or property. Nevertheless, appropriate measures will be taken to the extent practical to preserve, protect, or mitigate any damage to properties having HA significance.
