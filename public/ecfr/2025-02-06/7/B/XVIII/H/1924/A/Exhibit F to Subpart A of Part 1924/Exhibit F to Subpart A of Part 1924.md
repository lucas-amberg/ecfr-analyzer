# Exhibit F to Subpart A of Part 1924—Payment Bond


PROVIDED, that beneficiaries or claimants hereunder shall be limited to the SUBCONTRACTORS, and persons, firms, and corporations having a direct contract with the PRINCIPAL or its SUBCONTRACTORS.


PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the said SURETY for value received hereby stipulates and agrees that no change, extension of time, alteration or addition to the terms of the contract or to the WORK to be performed thereunder or the SPECIFICATIONS accompanying the same shall in any way affect its obligation on this BOND, and it does hereby waive notice of any such change, extension of time, alteration or addition to the terms of this contract or to the WORK or to the SPECIFICATIONS.


PROVIDED, FURTHER, that no suit or action shall be commenced hereunder by any claimant: (a) Unless claimant, other than one having a direct contract with the PRINCIPAL (or with the GOVERNMENT in the event the GOVERNMENT is performing the obligations of the OWNER), shall have given written notice to any two of the following: The PRINCIPAL, the OWNER, or the SURETY above named within ninety (90) days after such claimant did or performed the last of the work or labor, or furnished the last of the materials for which said claim is made, stating with substantial accuracy the amount claimed and the name of the party to whom the materials were furnished, or for whom the work or labor was done or performed. Such notice shall be served by mailing the same by register mail or certified mail, postage prepaid, in an envelope addressed to the PRINCIPAL, OWNER, or SURETY, at any place where an office is regularly maintained for the transaction of business, or served in any manner in which legal process may be served in the state in which the aforesaid project is located, save that such service need not be made by a public officer. (b) After the expiration of one (1) year following the date of which PRINCIPAL ceased work on said CONTRACT, it being understood, however, that if any limitation embodied in the BOND is prohibited by any law controlling the construction hereof, such limitation shall be deemed to be amended so as to be equal to the minimum period of limitation permitted by such law.


PROVIDED, FURTHER, that it is expressly agreed that the BOND shall be deemed amended automatically and immediately, without formal and separate amendments hereto, upon amendment to the Contract not increasing the contract price more than 20 percent, so as to bind the PRINCIPAL and the SURETY to the full and faithful performance of the Contract as so amended. The term “Amendment”, wherever used in this BOND and whether referring to this BOND, the contract or the loan Documents shall include any alteration, addition, extension or modification of any character whatsoever.


PROVIDED, FURTHER, that no final settlement between the OWNER or GOVERNMENT and the CONTRACTOR shall abridge the right of any benficiary hereunder, whose claim may be unsatisfied.


IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this instrument is executed in [number] counterparts, each one of which shall be deemed an original, this the ____ day of ______.
