# Exhibit J to Subpart A of Part 1924—Manufactured Home Sites, Rental Projects and Subdivisions: Development, Installation and Set-Up


I. *Purpose and Scope.* This exhibit describes and identifies acceptable site development, installation and set-up practices and concepts for manufactured homes. It is intended for Agency field personnel, builders, developers, sponsors, and others participating in Agency housing programs.


This exhibit applies to all manufactured homes (except those referenced in exhibit B of this subpart) on scattered sites or in rental projects and subdivisions and covers the requirements for design and construction of manufactured home communities. The Agency may approve alternatives or substitutes if it finds the proposed design satisfactory for the proposed use, and if the materials, installation, device, arrangement, or method of work is at least equivalent to that prescribed in this exhibit considering quality, strength, effectiveness, durability, safety and protection of life and health.


The Agency will require satisfactory evidence to be submitted to substantiate claims made regarding the use of any proposed alternative.


II. *Background.* The Agency has authority to make (1) section 502 Rural Housing (RH) loans with respect to manufactured homes and lots, and (2) section 515 Rural Rental Housing (RRH) loans with respect to manufactured home rental projects.


The manufactured home must be constructed in conformance with the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standard (FMHCSS) and be permanently attached to a site-built permanent foundation which meets or exceeds the Minimum Property Standards (MPS) for One- and Two-Family Dwellings or Model Building Codes acceptable to the Agency. The manufactured home must be permanently attached to that foundation by anchoring devices adequate to resist all loads identified in the MPS. This includes resistance to ground movements, seismic shaking, potential shearing, overturning and uplift loads caused by wind. Note that anchoring straps or cables affixed to ground anchors other than footings will *not* meet these requirements.


7 CFR part 1970 applies on scattered sites, in subdivisions and rental projects with regard to the development, installation and set-up of manufactured homes. To determine the level of environmental analysis required for a particular application, each manufactured home or lot involved will be considered as equivalent to one housing unit or lot. Because the development, installation and set-up of manufactured home communities, including scattered sites, rental projects, and subdivisions, differ in some requirements from conventional site and subdivision development, two of the purposes of this exhibit are to:


A. Encourage economical and orderly development of such communities and nearby areas, and


B. Promote the safety and health of residents of such communities.


Therefore, this exhibit identifies those required standards and regulations and suggested guidelines for eliminating and preventing health and safety hazards and promoting the economical and orderly development and utilization of land for planning and development of manufactured home communities. The exhibit also provides the requirements for meeting the following:


A. *Resistance to Wind.* Foundations and anchorages shall be designed to resist wind forces specified in American National Standards Institute (ANSI) A-58.1-1982 for the geographic area in which the manufactured home will be sited;


B. *Proper Installation.* The manufacturer's installation instructions provided with each manufactured home shall contain instructions for at least one site-built foundation with interior and/or perimeter supports. Agency field office personnel shall review to determine its adequacy as security for an Agency loan only, the foundation design concept for compliance with this exhibit, the Agency/MPS and any Model Building Code acceptable to the Agency in that particular geographic area; and


C. *Proper Foundation Design.* Manufactured homes shall be installed on a foundation system which is designed and constructed to sustain, within allowable stress and settlement limitations, all applicable loads. Any foundation and anchorage system or method of construction to be used should be analyzed in accordance with well-established principles of mechanics and structural engineering.


III. *Definitions.* For the purpose of this exhibit the following definitions apply:


*Accessory Building or Structure.*

A subordinate building or structure which is an addition to or supplements the facilities provided by a manufactured home.


*Anchoring Systems.* An approved system for securing the manufactured home to the ground or foundation system that will, when properly designed and installed, resist overturning and lateral movement of the home from wind forces.


*Contiguous.* Sharing a boundary, adjoining or adjacent. A lot or subdivision is considered to be contiguous to other lots or subdivisions if it is adjoining, touching or adjacent.


*Federal manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards (FMHCSS).* A 1976 federal standard, commonly known as the HUD Standard, for the construction, design and performance of a manufactured home which meets the needs of the public including the need for quality, durability and safety. Units conforming to the FMHCSS are certified by an affixed label that reads as follows:


AS EVIDENCED BY THIS LABEL NO. ________ THE MANUFACTURER CERTIFIES TO THE BEST OF THE MANUFACTURER'S KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF THAT THIS MANUFACTURED HOME HAS BEEN INSPECTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND IS CONSTRUCTED IN CONFORMANCE WITH THE FEDERAL MANUFACTURED HOME CONSTRUCTION AND SAFETY STANDARDS IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF MANUFACTURE. SEE DATA PLATE.


*Manufactured Home.* A structure which is built to the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards and Agency's thermal requirements. It is transportable in one or more sections, which in the traveling mode is ten body feet or more in width, and when erected on site is four hundred or more square feet, and which is built on a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. It is designed and constructed for permanent occupancy by a single family and contains permanent eating, cooking, sleeping and sanitary facilities. The plumbing, heating, and electrical systems are contained in the structure.


*Manufactured Home Community.* A parcel or contiguous parcels of land which contains two or more manufactured home sites available to the general public for occupancy. Sites and units may be for rent, or sites may be sold for residential occupancy (as in a subdivision).


*Manufactured Home Rental Project.* A parcel or multiple parcels of land which have been so designated and improved to contain manufactured homes with sites available for rent.


*Manufactured Home Site.* A designated parcel of land in a manufactured home rental project, subdivision or scattered site designed for the accommodation of a unit and its accessory structures for the exclusive use of the occupants.


*Manufactured Home Subdivisions.* Five or more contiguous (developed or undeveloped) lots, or building sites that meet the requirements of subpart C of part 1924 of this chapter.


*Permanent Perimeter Enclosure.* A permanent perimeter structural system completely enclosing the space between the floor joist of the manufactured home and the ground. If separate from the foundation system, the permanent perimeter enclosure shall be secured to the perimeter of the manufactured home, properly ventilated and accessible and constructed of materials that conform to the Agency adopted MPS requirements for foundations.


*Pier Support System.* Consists of footings, piers, caps, leveling spacers, or approved prefabricated load bearing devices.


*Related Facilities.* Any nonresidential structure or building used for rental housing related purposes.


*Site-Built Permanent Foundation System.* A foundation system (consisting of a combination of footings, piers, caps and shims and anchoring devices or required structural connections) which is designed and constructed to support the unit and sustain, within allowable stress and settlement limitations, all applicable loads specified in ANSI A58.1-1982. All loads shall be transferred from the manufactured home to the earth at a depth below the established frost line without exceeding the safe bearing capacity of the supporting soil.


*Set-Up.* The work performed and operations involved in the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation system, to include installation of accessories or appurtenances and anchoring devices, and when local regulations permit, connection of utilities, but excluding preparation of the site.


IV. *Compliance with Local Regulations.* These requirements do not replace site development standards established by local law, ordinances, or regulations. Whenever such local standards contain more stringent provisions than any of the site development, installation and set-up minimums of the Agency, the more stringent standards shall govern.


V. *Applicable Standards, Regulations and Manuals.* A. Manufactured housing to be financed by the Agency must comply with the following standards:


1. Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards, 24 CFR part 3280, mandated by Congress under title VI of the Federal Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, except for § 3280.506, “Heat Loss,” of subpart F, “Thermal Protection,” to part 3280.


2. Foundation requirements of the Minimum Property Standards as adopted by the Agency or a Model Building Code acceptable to the Agency.


3. [Reserved]


4. Uniform Federal Accessibility Standard (UFAS).


5. ANSI A58.1-1982, Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures.


B. Manufactured housing to be financed by the Agency shall comply with all applicable Agency regulations, including but not limited to the following:

C. The finished grade elevation beneath the manufactured home or the first floor elevation of the habitable space, whichever is lower, must be above the 100-year flood elevation. This requirement applies wherever manufactured homes may be installed, not just in locations designated by the National Flood Insurance Program as areas of special flood hazards. The use of fill to accomplish this is a last resort. As is stated in EO 11988 and 7 CFR part 1970, it is the Agency's policy not to approve or fund any proposal in a 100-year floodplain area unless there is no practicable alternative to such a floodplain location.


D. Essential services such as employment centers, shopping, schools, recreation areas, police and fire protection, and garbage and trash removal shall be convenient to the development and any site, community, or subdivision must comply with the environmental review requirements in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970.


E. Manufactured home sites, rental projects and subdivisions shall not be subject to any adverse influences of adjacent land uses. An adverse influence is considered as one that is out of the acceptable level or range of a recognizable standard or where no standard exists is considered a nuisance irrespective of a site being zoned for manufactured home use. Health, safety and aesthetic consequences of location shall be carefully assessed by inspection of the site prior to selection of development. Undesirable land uses sush as deteriorated residential or commercial areas and noxious industrial properties shall be avoided to ensure compatibility. Other undesirable elements such as heavily traveled highways, airport runways, railroad, or fire hazards and other areas subject to recognizably intolerable noise levels shall be avoided.


F. The requirements for streets shall be those found in subpart C of part 1924 of this chapter.


G. The site design and development shall be in accordance with sound engineering and architectural practices and shall provide for all utilities in a manner which allows adequate, economic, safe, energy efficient and dependable systems with sufficient easements for their required installation and maintenance.


H. Utilities for each manufactured home site, rental housing project or subdivision shall be designed and installed in accordance with subpart C of part 1924 of this chapter; and the State health authority having jurisdiction, and all local laws and regulations requiring approval prior to construction.


I. Exhibit C, section V of this subpart shall be complied with by the applicant, dealer-contractor or builder-developer for manufactured home projects with individual water supply and sewage disposal systems. This exhibit shall be used by the Agency County Supervisors, District Directors, and State Directors in reviewing submissions.

If the exposed composite wall and roof of two or more manufactured homes are proposed to be joined they shall be without openings and constructed of materials which will provide a minimum one-hour fire rating each, or the manufactured homes are separated by a one-hour fire rated barrier designed and approved for such installation and permitted by the authority having jurisdiction.


D. Manufactured homes shall not be positioned vertically (stacked) with one over the other in whole or in part without the specific approval of the authority having jurisdiction.


I. *General.* Adequate site development and foundation installation drawings and specfications shall be provided by the applicant or dealer-contractor to the Agency to fully describe the construction and other development work. These documents shall be provided according to the requirements of § 1924.5(f)(1) of this subpart. Contract documents will be prepared in accordance with § 1924.6 and, in the case of multiple family housing construction and development, § 1924.13 of this subpart.


A. The documents recommended shall be used as a guide for drawings and specifications to be submitted in support of all types of loan and/or grant applications involving manufactured homes. Adequate and accurate drawings and specifications are necessary to:


1. Determine the acceptability of the physical environment and improvements,


2. Determine compliance with the applicable standards and codes,


3. Review cost estimates, and


4. Provide a basis for financing, inspections, and the warranty.


B. Detailed floor plans, drawings and specifications are not required for any manufactured home to be installed on a scattered site, in a subdivision or rental housing project. However, a schematic floor plan should be submitted by the applicant when applying for Agency financing. The unit must have an affixed label as specified in exhibit D of this subpart indicating that the unit is constructed to the Agency thermal requirements for the appropriate winter degree days. This will indicate that the manufacturer certifies that the unit has been properly inspected and it meets the Agency Thermal Performance Construction Standard.


C.

IV. *Rental Housing Projects.* Subpart C of part 1924 of this chapter will be used in preparing and providing supporting documents.


V. *Specifications.* A. Form RD 424-2, “Description of Materials,” or other acceptable and comparable descriptions of all materials used for site development, foundation installation and the permanent perimeter enclosure shall be submitted with the drawings by the applicant.


B. The material identification information shall be in sufficient detail to fully describe the material, size and grade. Where necessary, additional sheets shall be attached as well as manufacturer's specification sheets for equipment and/or special materials.


I. *General.* The following policies will govern the inspection of all manufactured housing development work. This includes scattered sites, subdivisions, rental housing projects and all accessory structures and related facilities unless otherwise indicated.


II. *Inspections.* A. The responsibility for frequency and propose of inspections shall be in accordance with § 1924.9(b) (1), (2) and (3) of this subpart. The inspection requirements of § 1924.13 apply to the planning and conduct of construction work on all 515 housing developments that are more extensive in scope and more complex in nature than those involving an individual manufactured housing unit. The Stage 2 inspection customary for site-built housing when the building is enclosed is not required for manufactured homes.


The Stage 2 inspection for manufactured homes will be made within two working days after erection or placement on the foundation to determine compliance with accepted installation drawings and specifications for installation and set-up and to verify that the correct unit is on the site.


Stages 2 and 3 inspections for manufactured homes may be combined when authorized by the State Director.


B. The borrower will join the County Supervisor or the District Director in making periodic inspections as often as possible and always for the final inspection.


C. The borrower should be encouraged to make enough periodic visits to the site to be familiar with the progress and performance of the work in order to protect the borrower's interest. If the borrower observes or otherwise becomes aware of any fault or defect in the work or nonconformance with the contract documents, the borrower should give prompt written notice thereof to the dealer-contractor and a copy of the notice to the appropriate County Supervisor or District Director.


D. During inspection, it will generally be infeasible to determine whether a manufactured unit erected on a site was properly braced and stiffened during transportation. Inspectors should examine these units to determine that there is no obvious damage or loosening of fastenings that may have occurred during transportation. The dealer-contractor must warrant these units against such damage, which should protect the Agency's interest.


III. *Warranty Plan Coverage.* The warranty requirements for all development work shall be in accordance with § 1924.9(d) of this subpart and 7 CFR part 3550, subpart B.
