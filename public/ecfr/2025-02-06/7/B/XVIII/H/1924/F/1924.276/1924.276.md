# ยง 1924.276   Action against contractor.

If Rural Development pays for correction of construction defects which are the responsibility of the contractor, debarment proceedings will be initiated against the contractor in accordance with subpart M of part 1940 of this chapter (available in any Rural Development office), even if the contractor has gone out of business, declared bankruptcy, cannot be located, etc. The debarment will be pursued in both the contractor's company name and the principal parties as individuals, and any successor entities, if known. If the manufacturer of the defective product is determined to be solely responsible, no action will be taken against the contractor. In such a case, debarment will be initiated against the manufacturer. An assignment of the borrower's claim against the contractor or other party will be obtained if it appears to the approval officials, with any necessary advice from the Office of the General Counsel, that recovery is reasonably possible.
