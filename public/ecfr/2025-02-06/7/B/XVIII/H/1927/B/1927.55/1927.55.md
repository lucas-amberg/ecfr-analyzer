(a) *Responsibilities of closing agents.* Services to be provided to the agency and the borrower by a closing agent in connection with the transaction vary depending on whether a title insurance policy or title opinion is being furnished. The closing agent is expected to perform these services without unnecessary delay.


(b) [Reserved]


(c) *Ordering title services.* Application for title examination or insurance will be made by the borrower to a title company or attorney. The lender's policy will be for at least the amount of the loan. The United States of America will be named as the insured lender.


(d) *Use of title opinion.* If a title opinion will be issued, a title examination will include searches of all relevant land title and other records, so as to express an opinion as to the title of the property and the steps necessary to obtain the appropriate title and security position to issue a title opinion as required by this subpart. The closing agent or approved attorney will determine:


(1) The legal description and all owners of the real property;


(2) Whether there are any exceptions affecting the property and advise the approval official and borrower of the nature and effect of outstanding interests or exceptions, prior sales of part of the property, judgments, or interests to assist in determining which exceptions must be corrected in order for the borrowers to obtain good and marketable title of record in accordance with prevailing title examination standards, and for the agency to obtain a valid lien of the required priority;


(3) Whether there are outstanding Federal, State, or local tax claims (including taxes which under State law may become a lien superior to a previously attaching mortgage lien) or homeowner's association assessment liens;


(4) Whether outstanding judgments of record, bankruptcy, insolvency, divorce, or probate proceedings involving any part of the property, whether already owned by the borrower, or to be acquired by assumption or with loan funds, or involving the borrower or the seller exist;


(5) If a water right is to be included in the security for the loan, and if so, the full legal description of the water right;


(6) In addition to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, if wetlands easements or other conservation easements have been placed on the property;


(7) What measures are required for preparing, obtaining, or approving curative material, conveyances, and security instruments, and


(8) That sufficient copies of these interests and exceptions are provided as requested by the approval official.


(e) *Use of title insurance.* When title insurance is to be obtained, the approval official will be furnished with a title insurance binder disclosing any defects in, exceptions to, and encumbrances against, the title, the conditions to be met to make the title insurable and in the condition required by the agency, and the curative or other actions to be taken before closing of the transaction. The binder must include a commitment to issue a lender policy in an amount at least equal the amount of the loan, except in instances where there may be an outstanding owner's policy in favor of the borrower. Not withstanding the provisions of this section, the instance of an assumption without a subsequent loan, the existing policy may be continued if the coverage meets or exceeds the assumption balance and the title company agrees in writing to extend coverage in full force and effect.
