# § 1940.552   Definitions.

(a) *Amount available for allocation.* Funds appropriated or otherwise made availiable to the Agency for use in authorized programs. On occasion, the allocation of funds to States may not be practical for a particular program due to funding or administrative constraints. In these cases, funds will be controlled by the National Office.


(b) *Basic formula criteria, data source and weight.* Basic formulas are used to calculate a basic state factor as a part of the methodology for allocating funds to the States. The formulas take a number of criteria that reflect the funding needs for a particular program and through a normalization and weighting process for each of the criteria calculate the basic State Factor (SF). The data sources used for each criteria is believed to be the most current and reliable information that adequately quantifies the criterion. The weight, expressed as a percentage, gives a relative value to the importance of each of the criteria.


(c) *Basic formula allocation.* The result of multiplying the amount available for allocation less the total of any amounts held in reserve or distributed by base or administrative allocation times the basic State factor for each State. The basic formula allocation (BFA) for an individual State is equal to:


(d) *Transition formula.* A formula based on a proportional amount of previous year allocation used to maintain program continuity by preventing large fluctuations in individual State allocations. The transition formula limits allocation shifts to any particular State in the event of changes from year to year of the basic formula, the basic criteria, or the weights given the criteria. The transition formula first checks whether the current year's basic formula allocation is within the transition range (+ or −percentage points of the proportional amount of the previous year's BFA).


(e) *Base allocation.* An amount that may be allocated to each State dependent upon the particular program to provide the opportunity for funding at least one typical loan or grant in each Rural Development State, District, or County Office. The amount of the base allocation may be determined by criteria other than that used in the basic formula allocation such as agency historic data.


(f) *Administrative allocations.* Allocations made by the Administrator in cases where basic formula criteria information is not available. This form of allocation may be used when the Administrator determines the program objectives cannot be adequately met with a formula allocation.


(g) *Reserve.* An amount retained under the National Office control for each loan and grant program to provide flexibility in meeting situations of unexpected or justifiable need occurring during the fiscal year. The Administrator may make distributions from this reserve to any State when it determined necessary to meet a program need or agency objective. The Administrator may retain additional amounts to fund authorized demonstration programs. When such demonstration programs exist, the information is outlined in exhibit A of this subpart (available in any FmFA State Office).


(h) *Pooling of funds.* A technique used to ensure that available funds are used in an effective, timely and efficient manner. At the time of pooling those funds within a State's allocation for the fiscal year or portion of the fiscal year, depending on the type of pooling, that have not been obligatedf by the State are placed in the National Office reserve. The Administrator will establish the pooling dates for each affected program.


(1) *Mid-year:* This pooling addresses the need to partially redistribute funds based on use/demand. Mid-year pooling occurs near the midpoint of the fiscal year.


(2) *Year-end:* This pooling is used to ensure maximum use of program funds on a national basis. Year-end pooling usually occurs near the first of August.


(3) *Emergency:* The Administrator may pool funds at any time that it is determined the conditions upon which the initial allocation was based have changed to such a degree that it is necessary to pool funds in order to efficiently carry out the Agency mission.


(i) *Availability of the allocation.* Program funds are made available to the Agency on a quarterly basis. In the high demand programs, it is necessary that specific instructions by given to the State Offices regarding the amount which is available for obligation during each quarter.


(j) *Suballocation by the State Director.* Dependent upon the individual program for which funds are being allocated, the State Director may be directed or given the option of suballocating the State allocation to District or County Offices. When suballocating the State Director may retain a portion of the funds in a State Office reserve to provide flexibility in situations of unexpected or justified need. When performing a suballocation the State Director will use the same formula, criteria and weights as used by the National Office.


(k) *Other documentation.* Additional instructions given to field offices regarding allocations.
