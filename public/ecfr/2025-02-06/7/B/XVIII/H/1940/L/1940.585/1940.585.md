(a) *Amount available for allocations.* See § 1940.552(a) of this subpart.


(b) *Basic formula criteria, data source and weight.* See § 1940.552(b) of this subpart.


(1) The criteria used in the basic formula are:


(i) State's percentage of national rural population—50 percent.


(ii) State's percentage of national rural population with incomes below the poverty level—25 percent.


(iii) State's percentage of national nonmetropolitan unemployment—25 percent.


(2) The data source for the first criterion is the most recent decennial Census data. The data source for the second and third criteria is the 5-year data from the American Community Survey (ACS). Each criterion is assigned a specific weight according to its relevance in determining need. The percentage representing each criterion is multiplied by the weight factor and summed to arrive at a State factor (SF). The SF cannot exceed 0.05.


(c) *Basic formula allocation.* See § 1940.552(c) of this subpart. States receiving administrative allocations do not receive formula allocations.


(d) *Transition formula.* See § 1940.552(d) of this subpart. The percentage range for the transition formula equals 30 percent (±15%).


(e) *Base allocation.* See § 1940.552(e) of this subpart. States receiving administrative allocations do not receive base allocations.


(f) *Administrative allocation.* See § 1940.552(f) of this subpart. States participating in the formula base allocation procedures do not receive administrative allocations.


(g) *Reserve.* See § 1940.552(g) of this subpart. States may request funds by forwarding a completed copy of guide 26 of subpart A of part 1942 of this chapter (available in any Rural Development office), to the National Office. Generally, a request for additional funds will not be honored unless the State has insufficient funds to obligate the loan requested.


(h) *Pooling of funds.* See § 1940.552(h) of this subpart. Funds are generally pooled at mid-year and year-end. Pooled funds will be placed in the National Office reserve and will be made available administratively.


(i) *Availability of the allocation.* See § 1940.552(i) of this subpart. The allocation of funds is made available for States to obligate on an annual basis although the Office of Management and Budget apportions it to the Agency on a quarterly basis.


(j) *Suballocation by the State Director.* See § 1940.552(j) of this subpart. State Director has the option to suballocate to District Offices.


(k) *Other documentation.* Not applicable.
