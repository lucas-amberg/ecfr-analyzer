# ยง 1940.956   State rural economic development review panel.

(a) *General.* In order for a State to become or remain an eligible State, the State must have a rural economic development panel that meets all requirements of this subpart. Each designated State will establish a schedule whereby the panel and Rural Development will coordinate the submission, review, and ranking process of preapplications/applications. The schedule will be submitted to the Under Secretary for concurrence and should consider the following:


(1) Timeframes should assure that applications selected for funding from the current FY's allocation of funds can be processed by Rural Development and funds obligated prior to the July 15 pooling established in ยง 1940.961(c) of this subpart;


(2) Initial submission of preapplications/applications from Rural Development to the panel and any subsequent submissions during the first year;


(3) How often during each FY thereafter should Rural Development submit preapplications/applications to the panel for review and ranking;


(4) Number of working days needed by the panel to review and rank preapplications/applications;


(5) Number of times during the FY the panel will submit a list of ranked preapplications/applications to Rural Development for funding consideration;


(6) Consider the matching of available loan and grant funds to assure that all allocated funds will be used;


(7) How to consider ranked preapplications/applications at the end of the FY that have not been funded; and


(8) How to consider requests for additional funds needed by an applicant to complete a project that already has funds approved; *i.e.*, construction bid cost overrun.


(b) *Duties and responsibilities.* The panel is required to advise the State Director on the desirability of funding applications from funds available to the State from designated rural development programs. In relation to this advice, the panel will have the following duties and responsibilities:


(1) *Establish policy and criteria to review and evaluate area plans and to review and rank preapplications/applications.* (i) *Area plan.* The panel will develop a written policy and criteria to use when evaluating area plans. The criteria to be used when evaluating area plans will assure that the plan includes, as a minimum, the technical information included in ยง 1940.959 of this subpart. The criteria will be in sufficient detail for the panel to determine that the plan is technically and economically adequate, feasible, and likely to succeed in meeting the stated goals of the plan. The panel will give weight to area-wide or regional plans and comments submitted by intergovernmental development councils or similar organizations made up of local elected officials charged with the responsibility for rural area or regional development. A copy of the policy and evaluating criteria will be provided to Rural Development.


(ii) *Applications.* The panel will annually review the policy and criteria used by the panel to evaluate and rank preapplications/applications in accordance with this subpart. The panel will assure that the policy and criteria are consistent with current rural development needs, and that the public has an opportunity to provide input during the development of the initial policy and criteria. The Governor will provide a copy of the initial policy and criteria established by the panel when submitting evidence of eligibility in accordance with ยง 1940.954 of this subpart. Annually, thereafter, and not later than September 1 of each FY, the State coordinator will send the Under Secretary evidence that the panel has reviewed the established policy and criteria. The State coordinator will also send the Under Secretary a copy of all revisions.

(i) The panel will accept any area plan that meets established criteria unless the plan is incompatible with any other area plan for that area that has been accepted by the panel; or


(ii) The panel will return any area plan that is technically or economically inadequate, not feasible, is unlikely to be successful, or is not compatible with other panel-accepted area plans for that area. When an area plan is returned, the panel will include an explanation of the reasons for the return and suggest alternative proposals.


(iii) The State coordinator will notify the State Director, in writing, of the panel's decision on each area plan reviewed.


(3) *Review and rank preapplications/applications.* The panel will review, rank, and transmit a ranked list of preapplications/applications according to the schedule prepared in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, and the following:

(A) Accept any preapplication/application determined to be compatible with such area plan; or


(B) Return to the State Director any preapplication/application determined not to be compatible with such area plan. The panel will notify the applicant when preapplication/applications are returned to the State Director.

(C) If additional ranking criteria for use by a panel are required in any designated rural development program regulation, the panel will give consideration to the criteria when ranking preapplications/applications submitted under that program.


(iii) *Transmit list of ranked preapplications/applications.* After the preapplications/applications have been ranked, the panel will submit a list of all preapplications/applications received to the State coordinator. The list will clearly indicate each preapplication/application accepted for funding and will list preapplications/applications in the order established for funding according to priority ranking by the panel. The list will not include a preapplication/application that is to be returned to the applicant in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section. The State coordinator will send a copy of the list to the State Director for further processing of the preapplication/application in accordance with ยง 1940.965 of this subpart. Once the panel has ranked and submitted the list to Rural Development and the State Director has selected a preapplication/application for funding, the preapplication/application selected will not be replaced with a preapplication/application received at a later date that may have a higher ranking.
