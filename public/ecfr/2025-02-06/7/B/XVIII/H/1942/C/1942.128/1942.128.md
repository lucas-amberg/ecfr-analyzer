(b) Borrowers with annual incomes not exceeding $100,000 may, with concurrence of the District Director, use Form RD 1942-53, “Cash Flow Report,” instead of page one of schedule one and schedule two of Form RD 442-2, “Statement of Budget, Income, and Equity.” When used for budgeting, the cash statement should be projected for the upcoming fiscal year. When used for quarterly or annual reports, the cash flow report should include current year projections and actual data for the prior year, the quarter just ended, and the current year to date.
