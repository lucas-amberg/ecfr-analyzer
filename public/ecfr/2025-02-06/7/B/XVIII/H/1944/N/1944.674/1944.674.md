# § 1944.674   Public participation and intergovernmental review.

(a) In preparing its statement of activities, the applicant is responsible for consulting with leaders from the county, parish and/or township governments of the area where HPG activities will take place for the purpose of assuring that the proposed HPO program is beneficial and does not duplicate current activities. American Indian nonprofit organization applicants should obtain the written concurrence of the tribal governing body in lieu of consulting with the county governments when the program is operated only on tribal land.


(b) The applicant must also make its statement of activities available to the public for comment. The applicant must announce the availability of its statement of activities for review in a newspaper of general circulation in the project area and allow at least 15 days for public comment.
