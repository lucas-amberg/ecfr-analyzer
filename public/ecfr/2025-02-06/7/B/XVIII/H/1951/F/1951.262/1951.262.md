# § 1951.262   Farm Credit Programs—graduation of borrowers.

(a)-(d) [Reserved]


(e) *Graduation candidates.* Borrowers who are classified “commercial” or “standard” are graduation candidates. At least every 2 years, all borrowers who have a current classification of commercial or standard must submit a year-end balance sheet, actual financial performance information for the most recent year, and a projected budget for the current year to enable the Agency to reclassify their status and determine their ability to graduate.


(f) *Sending prospectus information to lenders.* (1) The Agency will distribute a borrower's prospectus to local lenders for possible refinancing. The borrower's permission is not required, however, the borrower must be notified of this action.


(2) The borrower is responsible for any application fees. The borrower has 30 days from the date the borrower is notified of lender interest in refinancing to make application, if required by the lender, and refinance the FLP loan. For good cause, the borrower may be granted a reasonable amount of additional time by the Agency.
