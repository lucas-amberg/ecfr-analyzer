# ยง 1955.106   Disposition of farm property.

(a) *Rights of previous owner and notification.* Before property which secured a Farm Credit Programs loan is taken into inventory, the FSA county official will advise the borrower-owner of Homestead Protection rights (see subpart S of part 1951 of this chapter.)


(b) *Racial, ethnic, and gender consideration.* The County Supervisor will make a special effort to insure that prospective purchasers, who traditionally would not be expected to apply for farm ownership loan assistance because of existing racial, ethnic, or gender prejudice, are informed of the availability of the Socially Disadvantaged Program. Emphasis will be placed on providing assistance to such socially disadvantaged applicants in accordance with the applicable sections of subpart A of part 1943 of this chapter.


(c) *Nonprogram (NP) borrowers.* Nonprogram (NP) borrowers are not eligible for Homestead Protection provisions as set forth in subpart S of part 1951 of this chapter. When it is determined that all conditions of ยง 1951.558(b) of subpart L of part 1951 of this chapter have been met, loans for unauthorized assistance will be treated as authorized loans and will be eligible for homestead protection.
