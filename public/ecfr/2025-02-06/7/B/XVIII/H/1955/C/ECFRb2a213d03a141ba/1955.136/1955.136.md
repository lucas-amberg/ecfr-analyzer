# § 1955.136   Environmental review requirements.

(a) Prior to a final decision on some disposal actions, the action must comply with the environmental review requirements in accordance with the agency's environmental policies and procedures found in 7 CFR part 1970.




(1) The conveyance is controversial for environmental reasons and/or is qualified within those categories described in § 1955.137 of this subpart.


(2) The Rural Development approval official has reason to believe that conveyance would result in a change in use of the real property. For example, farmland would be converted to a nonfarm use; or an industrial facility would be changed to a different industrial use that would produce increased gaseous, liquid or solid wastes over the former use or changes in the type or contents of such wastes. Assessments are not required for conveyance where the real property would be retained in its former use within the reasonably foreseeable future.


(b) When an EA or EIS is prepared it shall address the requirements of Departmental Regulation 9500-3, “Land Use Policy,” in connection with the conversion to other uses of prime and unique farmlands, farmlands of statewide or local importance, prime forest and prime rangelands, the alteration of wetlands or flood plains, or the creation of nonfarm uses beyond the boundaries of existing settlements.
