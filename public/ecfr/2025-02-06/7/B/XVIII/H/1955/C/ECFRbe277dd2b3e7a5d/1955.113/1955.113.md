# ยง 1955.113   Price (housing).

Real property will be offered or listed for its present market value, as adjusted by any administrative price reductions provided for in this section. Market value will be based upon the condition of the property at the time it is made available for sale. However, when a section 515 RRH credit sale is being made to a nonprofit organization or public body to utilize former single family dwellings as a rental or cooperative project for very-low-income residents, the price will be the lesser of the Government's investment or market value, less administrative price reductions, if any. Market value for multi-family housing projects will be determined through an appraisal conducted in accordance with subpart B to part 1922 of this chapter. Multi-family housing appraisals conducted shall reflect the impact of any restrictive-use provisions attached to the project as part of the credit sale.


(a) *SFH price reduction.* SFH property will be appraised at any time additional market data indicates this action is warranted. If SFH inventory has not sold after being actively marketed, the price will be administratively reduced. An administrative price reduction will be made without changing the SFH appraisal. For ease in computing dates for administrative price reductions, each month is assumed to have thirty days. The following schedule of administrative price reductions will be followed:


(1) *Program property.* If program property has not sold after being actively marketed at the current appraised value for 45 days during which time program applicants have exclusive rights to purchase the property, plus an additional 30 days to any offeror, the price will be administratively reduced by 10 percent of the appraised value. During the first 45 days after the price reduction, the property will be actively marketed with program applicants having exclusive rights to purchase the property, and at the expiration of this 45-day period, the property may be sold to any offeror. If at the end of this 75-day period the property remains unsold, a second price reduction of 10 percent of the appraised value will be made. During the first 45 days after the second price reduction, the property will be actively marketed with program applicants having exclusive rights to purchase the property, and at the expiration of this 45-day period, the property may be sold to any offeror. If the property does not sell within 75 days of the second price reduction, further guidance is provided in ยง 1955.114(a)(6) and Exhibit D (available in any Rural Development office) of this subpart. 

(2) *Nonprogram (NP) property.* If NP property has not been sold after being actively marketed for 45 days, the price will be administratively reduced by 10 percent of the appraised value. If the property remains unsold after an additional 45-day period of active marketing, one further price reduction of 10 percent of the appraised value will be made. If the property does not sell within 45 days of the second price reduction, further guidance is provided in ยง 1955.115(a)(1) and Exhibit D (available in any Rural Development office) of this subpart.


(b) *MFH price reduction.* For multiple-family property, the sale price will only be reduced to the extent that the market value has decreased as shown in a current market appraisal. The District Director will not reduce the price without the prior written approval of the State Director. The State Director must request National Office authorization on reductions in price for multiple-family property if the inventory value at the time of acquisition exceeded the State Director's loan approval authority.
