# § 1962.30   Subordination and waiver of liens on chattel security.

(a) *Purposes.* Subject to the limitations set out in paragraph (b) of this section, the Agency chattel liens may be subordinated to a lien of another creditor in either of the following situations:


(1) The prior lien will soon mature or has matured and the prior lienholder desires to extend or renew the obligation, or the obligation can be refinanced. The relative lien position of the Agency must be maintained; and


(2) The subordination will permit another creditor to refinance other debt or lend for an authorized direct loan purpose.


(b) *Conditions.* Agency chattel liens may be subordinated to a lien of another creditor if all of the following conditions are met:


(1) If the lien is on basic chattel security, the amount of subordination is necessary to provide the lender with the security it requires to make the loan;


(2) Approval of a subordination is limited to a specific amount and the loan to be secured by the subordination is closed within a reasonable time;


(3) Only one subordination to one creditor may be outstanding at any one time in connection with the same security;


(4) The borrower has not been convicted of planting, cultivating, growing, producing, harvesting or storing a controlled substance under Federal or state law. “Borrower” for purposes of this provision, specifically includes an individual or entity borrower and any member stockholder, partner, or joint operator, of an entity borrower and any member, stockholder, partner, or joint operator of an entity borrower. “Controlled substance” is defined at 21 CFR part 1308. The borrower will be ineligible for a subordination for the crop year in which the conviction occurred and the four succeeding crop years. Applicants must attest on the Agency application form that it and its members, if an entity, have not been convicted of such a crime;


(5) The borrower can document the ability to repay the total amount due under the subordination and pay all other debt payments scheduled for the subject operating cycle; and


(6) The Agency loan is still adequately secured after the subordination, or the value of the loan security will be increased by at least the amount of the advances to be made under the terms of the subordination.


(c) *Subordination to make a guaranteed loan.* In addition to the requirements of this section, subordinations on chattel security to make a guaranteed loan will be approved in accordance with § 1980.108 of subpart B of part 1980 of this chapter.


(d) *Forms.* Subordinations will be requested and executed on Agency forms available in any Agency office or on any other form approved by the Agency.


(e) *Rescheduling of existing Agency debts.* The Agency may consent to rescheduling of an existing Agency debt when a subordination is granted to the debt of another lender. The rescheduling will be allowed only when the borrower cannot reasonably be expected to meet all currently scheduled installments when due and the conditions of subpart S of part 1951 of this chapter are met.


(f) *Appraisal.* The Agency will prepare a chattel appraisal report when the existing appraisal report is more than 2 years old or is inadequate to make the determination in this section. The Agency may use an appraisal submitted by the borrower if it is substantially similar to Form RD 440-21, “Appraisal of Chattel Property,” and prepared by a licensed appraiser.
