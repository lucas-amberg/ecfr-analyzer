# § 1970.102   Preparation of EAs.

The EA must focus on resources that might be affected and any environmental issues that are of public concern.


(a) The amount of information and level of analysis provided in the EA should be commensurate with the magnitude of the proposal's activities and its potential to affect the quality of the human environment. At a minimum, the EA must discuss the following:


(1) The purpose and need for the proposed action;


(2) The affected environment, including baseline conditions that may be impacted by the proposed action and alternatives;


(3) The environmental impacts of the proposed action including the No Action alternative, and, if a specific project element is likely to adversely affect a resource, at least one alternative to that project element;


(4) Any applicable environmental laws and Executive Orders;


(5) Any required coordination undertaken with any Federal, state, or local agencies or Indian tribes regarding compliance with applicable laws and Executive Orders;


(6) Mitigation measures considered, including those measures that must be adopted to ensure the action will not have significant impacts;


(7) Any documents incorporated by reference, if appropriate, including information provided by the applicant for the proposed action; and


(8) A listing of persons and agencies consulted.


(b) The following describes the normal processing of an EA under this subpart:


(1) The Agency advises the applicant of its responsibilities as described in subpart A of this part. These responsibilities include preparation of the EA as discussed in § 1970.5(b)(3)(iv)(B).


(2) The applicant provides a detailed project description including connected actions.


(3) The Agency verifies that the applicant's proposal should be the subject of an EA under § 1970.101. In addition, the Agency identifies any unique environmental requirements associated with the applicant's proposal.


(4) The Agency or the applicant, as appropriate, coordinates with Federal, state, and local agencies with jurisdiction by law or special expertise; tribes; and interested parties during EA preparation.


(5) Upon receipt of the EA from the applicant, the Agency evaluates the completeness and accuracy of the documentation. If necessary, the Agency will require the applicant to correct any deficiencies and resubmit the EA prior to its review.


(6) The Agency reviews the EA and supporting documentation to determine whether the environmental review is acceptable.


(i) If the Agency finds the EA unacceptable, the Agency will notify the applicant, as necessary, and work to resolve any outstanding issues.


(ii) If the Agency finds the EA acceptable, the Agency will prepare or review a “Notice of Availability of the EA” and direct the applicant to publish the notice in local newspapers or through other distribution methods as approved by the Agency. The notice must be published for three consecutive issues (including online) in a daily newspaper, or two consecutive weeks in a weekly newspaper. If other distribution methods are approved, the Agency will identify equivalent requirements. The public review and comment period will begin on the day of the first publication date or equivalent if other distribution methods are used. A 14- to 30-day public review and comment period, as determined by the Agency, will be provided for all Agency EAs.


(7) After reviewing and evaluating all public comments, the Agency determines whether to modify the EA, prepare a FONSI, or prepare an EIS that conforms with subpart D of this part.


(8) If the Agency determines that a FONSI is appropriate, and after preparation of the FONSI, the Agency will prepare or review a public notice announcing the availability of the FONSI and direct the applicant to publish the public notice in a newspaper(s) of general circulation, as described in § 1970.14(d)(2). In such case, the applicant must obtain an “affidavit of publication” or other such proof from all publications (or equivalent verification if other media were used) and must submit the affidavits and verifications to the Agency.
