# ยง 1970.151   General.

(a) The purpose of an EIS is to provide a full and fair discussion of significant environmental impacts and to inform the appropriate Agency decision maker and the public of reasonable alternatives to the applicant's proposal, the Agency's proposed action, and any measures that would avoid or minimize adverse impacts.


(b) Agency actions for which an EIS is required include, but are not limited to:


(1) Proposals for which an EA was initially prepared and that may result in significant impacts that cannot be mitigated;


(2) Siting, construction (or expansion), and decommissioning of major treatment, storage, and disposal facilities for hazardous wastes as designated in 40 CFR part 261;


(3) Proposals that change or convert the land use of an area greater than 640 contiguous acres;


(4) New electric generating facilities, other than gas-fired prime movers (gas-fired turbines and gas engines) or renewable systems (solar, wind, geothermal), with a rating greater than 50 average MW, and all new associated electric transmission facilities;


(5) New mining operations when the applicant has effective control (*i.e.,* applicant's dedicated mine or purchase of a substantial portion of the mining equipment); and


(6) Agency proposals for legislation that may have a significant environmental impact.


(c) Failure to achieve compliance with this part will postpone further consideration of the applicant's proposal until the Agency determines that such compliance has been achieved or the applicant withdraws the application. If compliance is not achieved, the Agency will deny the request for financial assistance.
