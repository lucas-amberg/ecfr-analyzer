# § 1980.454   Conditions precedent to issuance of the Loan Note Guarantee.

In addition to compliance with the requirements of § 1980.60 of subpart A of this subpart, compliance with the following provisions are required prior to issuance of the Loan Note Guarantee.


(a) *Transfer of lenders.* The Rural Development State Director may approve a substitution of a new eligible lender in place of a former lender who holds an outstanding Conditional Commitment for Guarantee (where the Loan Note Guarantee has not yet been issued and the loan is within the State Director's loan approval authority) provided there are no changes in the borrower's ownership or control, loan purposes, scope of project and loan conditions in the Form RD 449-14 and the loan agreement remains the same. To effect such a substitution, the former lender will provide Rural Development with a letter stating the reasons it no longer desires to be a lender for the project. For loans in excess of the State Director's loan approval authority, National Office concurrence is required. The State Director will submit a recommendation concerning the transfer of lenders along with the lender's letter stating the reasons it no longer desires to be a lender for the project. The substituted lender will execute a new Part “B” of Form RD 449-1. If approved by Rural Development, the State Director will issue a letter or amendment to the original Form RD 449-14 reflecting the new lender and the new lender will acknowledge acceptance of the letter or amendment in writing.


(b) *Substitution of borrowers.* Rural Development will not issue a Loan Note Guarantee to the lender who is in receipt of a Form RD 449-14 with an obligation in a previous fiscal year if the originally approved borrower (including changes in legal entity) or owners are changed. The only exception to this provision prohibiting a change in the legal entity's form of ownership is when the originally approved borrower or owner is replaced with substantially the same individuals with substantially the same interests, as originally approved and identified in the Form RD 449-1, item 15. All requests for exceptions must be approved by the Rural Development National Office.


(c) *Changes in terms and conditions in Form RD 449-14.* It is the intent of Rural Development that once the Form RD 449-14 is issued and accepted by the lender, the commitment is not to be modified as to the scope of the project, overall facility concept, project purpose, use of proceeds or terms and conditions. Should changes be requested by the lender, the State Director will negotiate with the lender and proposed borrower any proposed changes to the originally accepted Form RD 449-14. If, as a result of these negotiations, the lender, proposed borrower or State Director presents alternate conditions which would result in a change in the scope of the project, and if the loan exceeds the State Director's loan approval authority, the State Director will submit these changes in the conditions by memorandum to the National Office for consideration with a copy of the revised Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 449-14 and any amendments thereto. Changes to the conditional commitment may be approved by the State Director for loans within their loan approval authority.


(d) *Additional requirements for B&I guaranteed loans.* All B&I borrowers and lenders, as applicable, must comply with Appendix D, paragraphs (I) (A) and (B); (II)(A) through (II)(A)(2)(g)(1); (II) (B) and (C); (III) (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E).


(e) *Preguarantee review.* Coincident with, or immediately after loan closing, the lender will contact Rural Development and provide those documents and certifications required in §§ 1980.60 and 1980.61 of subpart A of this part. Only when the Rural Development B&I or C&BP Chief or Loan Specialist, as required in paragraph B. (Administrative) of this section, is satisfied that all conditions for the guarantee have been met will the Loan Note Guarantee be executed.


(f) *Loan closing.* When loan closing plans are established, the lender will notify Rural Development.


(g) *Closing of working capital loans.* The State Director will not issue a Loan Guarantee for a working capital loan prior to the completion of all proposed construction for the project. Working capital loan funds will not be used to pay short-term notes.
