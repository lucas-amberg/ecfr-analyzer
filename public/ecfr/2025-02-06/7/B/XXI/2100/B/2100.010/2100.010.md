# ยง 2100.010   Entities in the biofuel supply chain.

The supply chain for feedstock crops used in biofuel production begins at a farm and ends at a biofuel refiner. Any entity within this supply chain that produces, processes, or takes ownership of reduced-CI crop or reduced-CI processed product must meet all applicable standards of this part. These entities include farms, first points of aggregation, intermediary entities, and biofuel refiners. If a biofuel refiner sources directly from a farm, the biofuel refiner is the first point of aggregation.
