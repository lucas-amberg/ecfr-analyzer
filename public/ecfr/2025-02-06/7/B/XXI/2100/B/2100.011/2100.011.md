Crops produced using one or more CSA practices, in accordance with subpart F of this part, are referred to as CSA crops. Crops produced without the use of CSA practices are referred to as conventional crops. A farm producer may produce both CSA crops and conventional crops. CSA crops and conventional crops can be physically mixed. Crops that are sold with an associated reduced-CI, as compared to the national average CI, are referred to as reduced-CI crops. Reduced-CI crops may be composed of solely CSA crops or a combination of CSA crops and conventional crops. If CSA crops and conventional crops are produced at the same farm, the commingled crop must have an associated CI that reflects the proportion of CSA crops, quantified in accordance with subpart C of this part. Crops for which a reduced-CI may be quantified include:
