(a) *Background.* 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) also required that each agency maintain and make available for public inspection and copying current indexes providing identifying information for the public with regard to any records which are made available for public inspection and copying.


(b) *Procedure.* Persons wishing to get an index may contact the division or center that maintains the records. Publication of these indexes as a separate document is unnecessary and impractical.
