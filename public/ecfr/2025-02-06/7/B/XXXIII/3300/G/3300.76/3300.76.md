(a) For equipment which has not previously been certified: 


(1) For each unit of equipment, a test in a U.S. ATP testing station or in a testing station located in and approved by a country which is a Contracting Party, to measure the K-coefficient of the insulated body and the efficiency of the thermal appliance in accordance with ยง 3300.10 and ยง 3300.13 of this rule. 


(2) If the equipment consists of serially-produced equipment manufactured by a particular equipment manufacturer, and belonging to one owner, certification may be based upon the following:

(e) Owners who receive a U.S. ATP certificate have the responsibility to maintain equipment in good repair and operating condition with the understanding that the certificate is valid only so long as: 


(1) The insulated body and the thermal appliance are maintained in good condition; 


(2) No material alteration is made to the thermal appliance which decreases its refrigeration capacity, and; 


(3) If the thermal appliance is replaced, it is replaced by an appliance of equal or greater refrigerating capacity.
