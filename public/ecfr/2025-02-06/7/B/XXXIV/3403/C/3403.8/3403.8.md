This section should establish the degree to which Phase I objectives were met and feasibility of the proposed research project was established.

In addition, a summary budget is required detailing the requested support for the overall project period. A budget narrative, with supporting budget detail for each budget category must be included.

(ii) *Customer and competition.* Clear description of key technology objectives, current competition, and advantages compared to competing products or services; description of hurdles to acceptance of the innovation.


(iii) *Market.* Milestone, target dates, analyses of market size, and estimated market share after first year sales and after five years; explanation of plan to obtain market share.


(iv) *Intellectual property.* Patent status, technology lead, trade secrets or other demonstration of a plan to achieve sufficient protection to realize the commercialization state and attain at least a temporary competitive advantage.


(v) *Financing.* Plans for securing necessary funding in Phase III.


(vi) *Assistance and mentoring.* Plans for securing needed technical or business assistance through mentoring, partnering, or through arrangements with state assistance programs, Small Business Development Centers, Federally-funded research laboratories, manufacturing extension Partnership Centers, or other assistance providers.
