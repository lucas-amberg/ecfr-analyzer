# § 3407.5   Classes of action.

The following describes typical classes of action associated with NIFA programs and related activities:


(a) Actions which normally do not require the preparation of an EA or an EIS are those actions which ordinarily do not have significant individual or cumulative effect on the quality of the human environment. These include those activities described in §§ 3407.6 (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this part.


(b) Actions normally requiring an EA, but not necessarily an EIS, are those projects in which at least some level of uncertainty exists regarding individual or cumulative effects on the quality of the human environment. Such actions generally include those identified in §§ 3407.6(b) and 3407.7 of this part.


(c) Actions normally requiring an EIS are projects which are determined to have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment or which will be performed under extraordinary circumstances. These types of actions are identified in §§ 3407.6(b) and 3407.8 of this part.
