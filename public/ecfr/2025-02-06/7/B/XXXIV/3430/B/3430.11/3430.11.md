(a) *Standards for competition.* Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, NIFA will enter into grants and cooperative agreements, unless restricted by statute, only after competition.


(b) *Exception.* The NIFA ADO and the designated Agency approving official may make a determination in writing that competition is not deemed appropriate for a particular transaction. Such determination shall be limited to transactions where it can be adequately justified that a noncompetitive award is in the best interest of the Federal Government and necessary to the goals of the program.
