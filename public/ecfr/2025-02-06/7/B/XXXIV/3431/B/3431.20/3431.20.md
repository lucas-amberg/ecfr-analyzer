# ยง 3431.20   Administration.

The VMLRP will be administered by NIFA. NIFA may carry out this program directly or enter into agreements with another Federal agency or other service provider to assist in the administration of the VMLRP. However, the determination of the veterinarian shortage areas, peer review of individual VMLRP applications, and the overall VMLRP oversight and coordination will reside with the Secretary.
