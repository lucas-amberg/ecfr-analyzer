# § 3550.52   Loan purposes.

Section 502 funds may be used to buy, build, rehabilitate, improve, or relocate an eligible dwelling and provide related facilities for use by the borrower as a permanent residence. In limited circumstances section 502 funds may be used to refinance existing debt. 




(a) *Purchases from existing RHS borrowers.* To purchase a property currently financed by an RHS loan, the new borrower will assume the existing RHS indebtedness or receive new loan funds as determined by the Agency. The Agency will periodically determine whether assumptions or new loans are appropriate on a program wide basis based on the best interest of the government, taking into account factors such as funding availability and staff resources. Regardless of the method, loan funds may be used for eligible costs as defined in paragraph (d) of this section or to permit a remaining borrower to purchase the equity of a departing co-borrower.






(b) *Refinancing non-RHS loans.* Debt from an existing non-RHS loan may be refinanced if the existing debt is secured by a lien against the property, RHS will have a first lien position on the security property after refinancing, and: 


(1) In the case of loans for existing dwellings, if: 


(i) Due to circumstances beyond the applicant's control, the applicant is in danger of losing the property, the debt is over $5,000, and the debt was incurred for eligible program purposes prior to loan application or was a protective advance made by the mortgagee for items covered by the loan to be refinanced, including accrued interest, insurance premiums, real estate tax advances, or preliminary foreclosure costs; or 


(ii) If a loan of $5,000 or more is necessary for repairs to correct major deficiencies and make the dwelling decent, safe and sanitary and refinancing is necessary for the borrower to show repayment ability, regardless of the delinquency. 


(2) In the case of loans for a building site without a dwelling, if: 


(i) The debt to be refinanced was incurred for the sole purpose of purchasing the site;


(ii) The applicant is unable to acquire adequate housing without refinancing; and 


(iii) The RHS loan will include funds to construct an appropriate dwelling on the site for the applicant's use. 


(3) Debts incurred after the date of RHS loan application but before closing may be refinanced if the costs are incurred for eligible loan purposes and any construction work conforms to the standards specified in this part. 




(c) *Refinancing RHS debt.* An existing RHS loan may be refinanced in accordance with § 3550.204 to allow the borrower to receive payment assistance. In addition, depending on the availability of funds and program priorities as determined by RHS, an existing RHS loan and the related subsidy recapture may be refinanced as allowed under § 3550.201.






(d) *Eligible costs.* Improvements financed with loan funds must be on land which, after closing, is part of the security property. In addition to acquisition, construction, repairs, or the cost of relocating a dwelling, loan funds may be used to pay for: 


(1) Reasonable expenses related to obtaining the loan, including legal, architectural and engineering, technical, title clearance, and loan closing fees; and appraisal, surveying, environmental, tax monitoring, and other technical services; and personal liability insurance fees for Mutual Self-Help borrowers. 


(2) The cost of providing special design features or equipment when necessary because of a physical disability of the applicant or a member of the household. 


(3) Reasonable connection fees, assessments, or the pro rata installment costs for utilities such as water, sewer, electricity, and gas for which the borrower is liable and which are not paid from other funds. 


(4) Reasonable and customary lender charges and fees if the RHS loan is being made in combination with a leveraged loan. 


(5) Real estate taxes that are due and payable on the property at the time of closing and for the establishment of escrow accounts for real estate taxes, hazard and flood insurance premiums, and related costs. 


(6) Packaging fees resulting from the certified loan application packaging process outlined in § 3550.75. The Agency will determine the limit, based on factors such as the level of service provided and the prevailing cost to provide the service, and such cap will not exceed two percent of the national average area loan limit. Nominal packaging fees not resulting from the certified loan application process are an eligible cost provided the fee does not exceed a limit determined by the Agency based on the level and cost of service factors, but no greater than one half percent of the national average area loan limit; the loan application packager is a nonprofit, tax exempt partner that received an exception to all or part of the requirements outlined in § 3550.75 from the applicable Rural Development State Director; and the packager gathers and submits the information needed for the Agency to determine if the applicant is eligible along with a fully completed and signed uniform residential loan application.






(7) Purchasing and installing essential equipment in the dwelling, including ranges, refrigerators, washers or dryers, if these items are normally sold with dwellings in the area and if the purchase of these items is not the primary purpose of the loans. 


(8) Purchasing and installing approved energy savings measures and approved furnaces and space heaters that use fuel that is commonly used, economical, and dependably available. 


(9) Providing site preparation, including grading, foundation plantings, seeding or sodding, trees, walks, yard fences, and driveways to a building site. 


(10) Reasonable fees for homeownership education as determined by the State Director under § 3550.11 of this subpart. Such fees may be added to the loan amount in excess of the area loan limit and appraised value of the house.


(e) *Loan restrictions.* Loan funds may not be used to: 


(1) Purchase an existing manufactured home, or for any other purposes prohibited in § 3550.73(b). 


(2) Purchase or improve income-producing land or buildings to be used principally for income-producing purposes. 


(3) Pay fees, commissions, or charges to for-profit entities related to loan packaging or referral of prospective applicants to RHS.
