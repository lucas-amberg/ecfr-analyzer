# ยง 3550.160   Refinancing with private credit.

(a) *Objective.* RHS direct loan programs are not intended to supplant or compete with private credit sources. Therefore, borrowers are required to refinance RHS loans with private credit sources when RHS determines that the borrower meets RHS criteria. 


(b) *Criteria for refinancing with private credit.* Borrowers must refinance with private credit when RHS determines that the borrower has the ability to obtain other credit at reasonable rates and terms based on their income, assets, and credit history. Reasonable rates and terms are those commercial rates and terms that borrowers are expected to meet when borrowing for similar purposes. Differences in interest rates and terms between RHS and other lenders will not be an acceptable reason for a borrower to fail to refinance with private credit if the available rates and terms are within the borrower's ability to pay. 


(c) *Notice of requirement to refinance with private credit.* The financial status of all borrowers may be reviewed periodically to determine their ability to refinance with private credit. A borrower's financial status may be reviewed at any time if information becomes available to RHS that indicates that the borrower's circumstances have changed. 


(1) A borrower undergoing review is required to supply, within 30 days of a request from RHS, sufficient financial information to enable RHS to determine the borrowers ability to refinance with private credit. Foreclosure action may be initiated against any borrower who fails to respond. 


(2) When RHS determines that a borrower has the ability to refinance with private credit, the borrower will be required to refinance within 90 days. 


(3) Within 30 days after being notified of the requirement to refinance with private credit, a borrower may contest the RHS decision and provide additional financial information to document an inability to refinance with private credit. 


(d) *Failure to refinance with private credit.* (1) If the borrower is unable to secure private credit, the borrower must submit written statements and documentation to RHS showing: 


(i) The lenders contacted. 


(ii) The amount of the loan requested by the borrower and the amount, if any, offered by the lenders. 


(iii) The rates and terms offered by the lenders or the specific reasons why other credit is not available. 


(iv) The information provided by the borrower to the lenders regarding the purpose of the loan. 


(2) If RHS determines that the borrower's submission does not demonstrate the borrower's inability to refinance with private credit, or if the borrower fails to submit the required information, foreclosure may be initiated. 


(e) *Subordination of recapture amount.* RHS may subordinate its interest in any deferred recapture amount to permit a borrower to refinance with private credit. The amount to which the RHS debt will be subordinated may include: 


(1) The amount required to repay the RHS debt, exclusive of recapture;


(2) Reasonable closing costs;


(3) Up to one percent of the loan amount for loan servicing costs, if required by the lender; and 


(4) The cost of any necessary repairs or improvements to the security property. 


(f) *Application for additional credit.* A borrower who has been asked to refinance with private credit will not be considered for additional credit until the refinancing issue is resolved unless such additional credit is necessary to protect the Government's interest.
