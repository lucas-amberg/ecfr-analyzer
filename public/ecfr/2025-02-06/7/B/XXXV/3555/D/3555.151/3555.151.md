# § 3555.151   Eligibility requirements.

(a) *Income eligibility.* At the time of loan approval, the household's adjusted income must not exceed the applicable moderate income limit. The lender is responsible for documenting the household's income to determine eligibility for the SFHGLP.


(b) *Citizenship status.* Applicants must provide evidence acceptable to the Agency of their status as United States citizens, U.S. non-citizen nationals, or qualified aliens, as defined in § 3555.10.


(c) *Principal residence.* Applicants must agree and have the ability to occupy the dwelling as their principal residence. The Agency may require evidence of this ability. Rural Development will not guarantee loans for investment properties, or temporary, short-term housing.


(d) *Adequate dwelling.* The dwelling must be modest, decent, safe, and sanitary.


(e) *Eligibility of current homeowners.* Current homeowners may be eligible for guaranteed home loans under this part if all the following conditions are met:


(1) The applicants are not financially responsible for another Agency guaranteed or direct home loan by the time the guaranteed home loan is closed;


(2) The current home no longer adequately meets the applicants' needs;


(3) The applicants will occupy the home financed with the SFHGLP loan as their primary residence;


(4) The applicants are without sufficient resources or credit to obtain the dwelling on their own without the guarantee;


(5) No more than one single family housing dwelling other than the one associated with the current loan request may be retained; and


(6) The applicants must be financially qualified to own more than one home. In order for net rental income from the retained dwelling to be considered for the applicant's repayment ability, the consistency of the rental income must be demonstrated for at least the previous 24 months, and the current lease must be for a term of at least 12 months after the loan is closed.


(f) *Legal capacity.* Applicants must have the legal capacity to incur the loan obligation, or have a court-appointed guardian or conservator who is empowered to obligate the applicant in real estate matters.


(g) *Suspension or debarment.* Applicants who are suspended or debarred from participation in Federal programs under 2 CFR parts 180 and 417 are not eligible for loan guarantees.


(h) *Repayment ability.* Applicants must demonstrate adequate repayment ability. Lenders must maintain documentation supporting the repayment ability analysis in the loan file. Refer to § 3555.152(a) for further information.


(1) A repayment ratio will be used to determine an applicant's ability to repay a loan. The Agency will utilize two ratios, principal, interest, taxes and insurance (PITI) ratio and total debt (TD) ratio, to determine adequate repayment for the requested loan. The Agency reserves the right to consider calculation of a single ratio in determining repayment for the requested loan.


(i) An applicant is considered to have adequate repayment ability when the monthly amount required for payment of PITI, homeowners' association dues, the monthly calculation of an annual fee, as applicable, and other real estate assessments does not exceed 29 percent of the applicant's repayment income and the monthly amount of PITI plus recurring monthly debts (total debt) does not exceed 41 percent of the applicant's repayment income.


(ii) For home purchases under the Rural Energy Plus provision of § 3555.209, the Agency reserves the right to allow flexibility in the PITI and TD ratio. The handbook will define what flexibilities can be extended.


(iii) Contributions to personal income taxes, retirement accounts (including the repayment of personal loans from those retirement accounts), savings (including repayment of loans secured by such funds), the cost to commute, membership fees in unions or like organizations, childcare or other voluntary obligations will not be considered in the TD ratio.


(iv) Except for obligations specifically excluded by State law, the debts of non-purchasing spouse must be included in the applicant's repayment ratios if the applicant resides in a community property state.


(2) The repayment ratio may exceed the percentage in paragraph (h)(1) of this section when certain compensating factors exist. The handbook, HB-1-3555, Appendix I, located at *https://www.rd.usda.gov/sites/default/files/hb-1-3555.pdf,* will provide examples of when a debt ratio waiver may be granted. The automated underwriting system will consider any compensating factors in determining when the variance is appropriate. Loans downgraded in the automated underwriting system which must be manually underwritten will require the lender to document compensating factors. The presence of compensating factors does not strengthen a ratio exception when multiple layers of risk are present in the application. Acceptable compensating factors, supporting documentation, and maximum ratio thresholds, will be further defined and clarified in the handbook. Compensating factors include but are not limited to:

(i) A credit score at an acceptable level of 680 or higher for any applicants, unless otherwise provided by the Agency. The Agency reserves the right to change the acceptable level of credit score.


(ii) A minimal increase in housing expense, i.e. the current rent payment is comparable to the proposed mortgage loan payment PITI and if applicable, homeowner association dues.


(iii) The demonstrated ability to accumulate savings and cash reserves post loan closing.


(iv) Continuous employment with a current primary employer.


(3) Loan ratio exceptions require written approval by Rural Development, or acceptance by an Agency approved automated underwriting system. Flexibilities surrounding loan ratio exceptions will be further clarified in the handbook. Lenders with loans accepted by an Agency approved automated underwriting system need not submit documentation for the need for a ratio waiver.


(4) If an applicant does not meet the repayment ability requirements, the applicant can increase repayment ability by having other eligible household members join the application.


(5) Mortgage Credit Certificates may be considered in determining an applicant's repayment ability.


(6) Section 8 Homeownership Vouchers may be used in determining an applicant's repayment ability. The monthly subsidy may be treated as repayment income in accordance with § 3555.152(a) or offset in the PITI.


(7) A funded buydown account may be used to reduce the borrower's monthly mortgage payment during the early years of repayment when all of the following requirements are met:


(i) The loan will be underwritten at the note rate.


(ii) The interest rate may be bought down to no more than 2 percentage points below the note rate.


(iii) The interest rate paid by the borrower may increase no more frequently than annually.


(iv) The interest rate paid by the borrower may increase no more than 1 percentage point annually.


(v) Funds must be placed in an escrow account with monthly releases scheduled directly to the lender.


(vi) Funds must be placed with a Federal- or state-regulated lender.


(vii) The escrow account must be fully funded for the buydown period.


(viii) The borrower is not permitted to use personal funds or funds borrowed from another source to establish the escrow account for the buydown.


(ix) The borrower must not be required to borrow or repay the funds.


(i) *Credit qualifications.* Applicants generally must have a verifiable credit history that indicates a reasonable ability and willingness to meet their debt obligations as evidenced by an acceptable credit score, a credit report from a recognized credit repository meeting the requirements of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA or VA, and other credit qualifications satisfactory to Rural Development.


(1) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(6) of this section, the applicant's credit history must demonstrate a past willingness and ability to meet credit obligations to enable the lender to evaluate each applicant and draw a logical conclusion about the applicant's commitment and ability to handling financial obligations successfully and ability to make payments on the new mortgage obligation.


(2) A loan's acceptance by an Agency approved automated underwriting system eliminates the need for the lender to submit documentation of the credit qualification decision as loan approval requirements will be incorporated in the automated system.


(3) For manually underwritten loans, lenders must submit documentation of the credit qualification decision. Lenders will use credit scores to manually underwrite loan mortgage requests. Lenders are required to validate the credit scores utilized in the underwriting determination. Indicators of significant derogatory credit will require further review and documentation of that review. Indicators of significant derogatory credit include, but are not limited to:


(i) A foreclosure that has been completed in the 36 months prior to application by the applicant.


(ii) A bankruptcy in which debts were discharged within 36 months prior to the date of application by the applicant. A lender may give favorable consideration to applicants who have entered into a bankruptcy debt restructuring plan who have completed 12 months of consecutive payments. The payment performance must have been satisfactory with all required payments made on time, and the Trustee or the Bankruptcy Judge must approve of the new credit.


(iii) One rent or mortgage payment paid 30 or more days late within the last 12 months prior to application by the applicant.


(iv) A previous Agency loan that resulted in a loss to the Government.


(4) When evidence of significant derogatory credit is present, lenders may consider extenuating circumstances, including but not limited to, whether the problems were caused by factors temporary in nature, if the circumstances leading to the derogatory credit were beyond the control of the applicant, and if the loan would significantly reduce the applicant's housing expenses.


(5) In all cases, the applicant cannot have an outstanding Federal judgment, other than a judgment obtained in the United States Tax Court, or a delinquent non-tax Federal debt that has not been paid in full or otherwise satisfied.


(6) For applicants without an established credit history, alternative methods may be used to evidence an applicant's willingness to pay, such as a non-traditional mortgage credit report or multiple independent verifications of trade references.


(7) A credit report for a non-purchasing spouse must be obtained in order to determine the debt-to-income ratio referenced at § 3555.151(h) if the applicant resides in a community property state.


(8) Lenders are encouraged to offer or provide for home ownership counseling. Lenders may require first-time homebuyers to undergo such counseling if it is reasonably available in the local area. When home ownership counseling is provided or sponsored by Rural Development or another Federal agency in the local area, the Lender must require the borrower to successfully complete the course.


(9) Applicants with delinquent child support payments subject to collection by administrative offset are ineligible unless the payments are brought current, the debt is paid in full, or otherwise satisfied.


(j) *Obtaining credit.* The applicant must be unable to obtain traditional conventional mortgage credit, as defined by the Agency, for the subject loan.
