Borrowers are required to make an initial operating capital contribution to the general operating account in the amount of at least 2 percent of the total development cost or appraised value, whichever is less.


(a) Borrowers that are nonprofit organizations, consumer cooperatives, or state or local public agencies and are not receiving low-income housing tax credits, may use loan funds for their initial operating capital contribution. All other borrowers must fund the initial operating capital contribution from their own resources.


(b) Borrowers must provide to the Agency for approval a list of materials and equipment to be funded from the general operating account for initial operating expenses. As specified in ยง 3560.304(b), initial operating capital may be used only to pay for approved budgeted expenses.
