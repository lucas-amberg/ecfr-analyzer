# § 3560.68   Permitted return on investment (ROI).

(a) *Permitted return.* Borrowers operating on a limited profit basis will be permitted a return not to exceed 8 percent of their required initial investment determined at the time of loan approval in accordance with § 3560.63(c).


(b) *Calculation of permitted return.* The permitted return will be based on the borrower's contributions from their own resources, which, when added to the Agency loan amount and all sources of funding or financing, do not exceed the security value of the MFH project as specified in § 3560.63(a).


(1) Proceeds received by the borrower from the syndication of low-income housing tax credit and contributed to the MFH project may be considered funds from the borrower's own resources for the portion of the proceeds which exceeds:


(i) The allowable developer's fee determined by the state agency administering the low-income housing tax credit, and


(ii) The borrower's expected contribution to the transaction, as determined by the state agency administering the low-income housing tax credit.


(2) A building site contributed by the borrower will be appraised by the Agency to determine its market value. A return may not be allowed on the amount above the equity contribution required by § 3560.63(c) if the market value as determined by the Agency, when added to the loan and grant amounts from all sources, exceeds the security value of the MFH project as specified in § 3560.63(a).


(c) *Return on additional investment.* The initial investment may exceed the equity contribution required by § 3560.63(c) and a return allowed on the investment if the additional return does not increase basic rents and rental assistance costs above what basic rents and rental assistance costs would have been with the Agency financing 95 or 97 percent of the total development cost.


(d) *Compensation to nonprofit organizations.* Although nonprofit organizations are not eligible to take a return on investment, with prior Agency approval, cooperatives and nonprofit organizations may use housing project funds to pay asset management expenses directly attributable to ownership responsibilities, as described in § 3560.303(b)(1)(ii).
