# § 3560.102   Housing project management.

(a) *General.* Borrowers hold final responsibility for housing project management and must ensure that operations comply with the terms of all loan or grant documents, Agency requirements and applicable local, state and Federal laws and ordinances. Project operations shall be conducted to meet the actual needs and necessary expenses of the property or for any other purpose authorized under Agency regulations. Any party not meeting these responsibilities may be subject to penalties. It is expected that only typical and reasonable expenses be incurred for the services rendered. Consequently, methods to inflate, duplicate, obscure, or failure to disclose the true nature and cost of work performed for the services rendered will cause the Agency to deny budget requests for the services or issue a demand for recovery and reimbursement for unauthorized actions.




(b) *Management plan.* Borrowers must develop and maintain a management plan for each housing project covered by their loan or grant. The management plan must establish the systems and procedures necessary to ensure that housing project operations comply with Agency requirements in this part. The management plan should describe whether administrative expenses are to be paid from management agent fees or project operations, including a task list of charges covered by the fee as outlined in paragraph (i)(3)(i)(A) of this section. The management plan must meet the standards set out in this part.












(c) *Management plan effective period.* A management plan remains in effect as long as it accurately reflects housing project operations and the housing project is in compliance with the Agency requirements.


(1) Borrowers must submit an updated management plan to the Agency if operations change or are no longer consistent with the management plan on file with the Agency.


(2) When there are no changes in operations, borrowers must submit a certification to the Agency every 3 years stating that operations are consistent with the management plan and the plan is adequate to assure compliance with the loan and grant documents and Agency requirements or applicable local, state and Federal laws.


(3) If the Agency determines that operations are in compliance with Agency requirements, loan or grant agreements, or applicable local, state, and Federal laws, but are not consistent with the management plan, the Agency will require the borrower to:


(i) Revise the management plan to accurately reflect housing operations;


(ii) Take actions to ensure the management plan is followed; or


(iii) Advise the Agency in writing of the action taken.


(4) When a housing project is being transferred from one borrower to another, the transferee must submit a management plan that addresses the required items identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section in sufficient detail to enable the Agency to give final approval of the transfer.


(d) *Housing projects with compliance violations.* Upon receiving notice of compliance violations in accordance with § 3560.354, borrowers must submit to the Agency:


(1) Revisions to the management plan establishing the changes in housing operations that will be made to restore compliance;


(2) If the borrower determines the compliance violations were due to a failure to follow the management plan, the borrower must certify to the Agency that the management plan is adequate to assure compliance with the applicable requirements of this part and submit a written description of the actions they will take to ensure the management plan is followed; or


(3) If the Agency discovers continued discrepancies between a management plan and housing project operations or compliance violations, the Agency may require the borrower to install a different management agent acceptable to the Agency as described in paragraph (e) of this section.


(e) *Acceptable management agents.* Borrowers must obtain Agency approval of the agent proposed to manage a housing project prior to entering into any formal agreement with the agent and prior to allowing the agent to assume responsibility for housing project operations. Borrowers that plan to self-manage a housing project also must receive Agency approval before assuming responsibility for housing operations.


(1) Borrowers must submit a written request for Agency approval of the proposed management agent at least 45 days prior to the date the agent is to assume responsibility for operations. This request must include a profile of the proposed management agent that provides sufficient information to allow the Agency to evaluate whether the agent is acceptable.


(2) The Agency will deny approval of any proposed management agent that cannot provide evidence of at least two years of experience and satisfactory performance in directing and overseeing the management of similar federally-assisted MFH.


(3) The Agency may issue approval of a management agent that does not meet the requirements of § 3560.102(e)(2) if the management agent can provide evidence that indicates the ability to successfully manage a MFH project in accordance with Agency requirements.


(4) If a borrower enters into an agreement with a management agent or begins to self-manage prior to receiving Agency approval, the Agency will place the borrower in non-monetary default status and will require the borrower to immediately terminate the contract with the management agent.


(f) *Self-management.* Borrowers may self-manage a housing project but must receive Agency approval before assuming responsibility for housing operations. Borrowers that plan to self-manage must meet all requirements of § 3560.102, except for paragraph (h) of this section.






(g) *Identity-of-interest disclosure.* Borrowers and management agents must disclose to the Agency all identity-of-interest relationships which they have with firms and must receive Agency approval to use such firms prior to entering into any contractual relationships with such entities that involve Agency funds.


(1) This disclosure must include any identity-of-interest relationships between:


(i) The borrower and the management agent;


(ii) The borrower or management agent and the providers of supplies and services to the housing project; 


(iii) The borrower or the management agent and employees of anyone listed in paragraphs (g)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section;




(iv) Any borrower's entity control, or interest held or possessed by a person's spouse, parent, child, grandchild, or sibling or other relation by blood or marriage is attributed to that person for the determination under this paragraph (g)(1).




(2) Failure to disclose such relationships may subject the borrower, the management agent, and the other firms or employees found to have an identity of interest relationship to suspension, debarment, or other remedies available to the Agency.

(i) The borrower, management agent, and supplier of goods and services must provide documentation proving that use of identity-of-interest firms is in the best interest of the housing project;

(iv) The Agency will deny the use of an identity-of-interest firm when the Agency determines such use is not in the best interest of the Federal Government or the tenants.
