(1) Senior position lienholder, if any;


(2) Operating and maintenance expenses, including taxes and insurance;


(3) Agency debt payments;

(5) All accounts payable;


(6) Other authorized expenditures; and


(7) Return on owner investment.


(d) *Determining if expenses are reasonable.* Generally, expenses charged to project operations, whether for management agent services or other expenses, must be reasonable, typical, necessary and show a clear benefit to the residents of the property. Services and expenses charged to the property must show value added and be for authorized purposes. If such value is not apparent, the service or expense should be examined.


(1) Administrative expenses for project operations exceeding 23 percent, or those typical for the area, of gross potential basic rents and revenues (*i.e.,* referred to as gross potential rents in industry publications) highlight a need for closer review for unnecessary expenditures. Budget approval is required, and project resources may not always permit an otherwise allowable expense to be incurred if it is not fiscally prudent in the market.


(2) Excessive administrative expenses can result in inadequate funds to meet other essential project needs, including expenditures for repair and maintenance needed to keep the project in sound physical condition. Actions that are improper or not fiscally prudent may warrant budget denial and/or a demand for recovery action.


(e) *Agency review and approval.* (1) The Agency will only approve housing project budgets that meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.


(2) If no rent change is requested, borrowers must submit budget documents for Agency approval 60 calendar days prior to the start of the housing project's fiscal year. The Agency will notify borrowers if the budget submission does not meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. The borrower will have 10 days to submit the additional material.


(3) If a rent change is requested, the borrower must submit budget documents to the Agency and notify tenants of the requested rent change at least 90 calendar days prior to the start of the housing project's fiscal year.


(i) The Agency will notify borrowers if the budget submission does not meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, or if the rent and utility allowance request has been denied in accordance with ยง 3560.205(f). The borrower will have 10 days to submit the additional material to address any issues raised by the Agency.


(ii) The rent change is not approved until the Agency issues a written approval. If there is no response from the Agency within the 30-day period, the rent change is considered automatic. The following budgets are not eligible for automatic approval:


(A) Budgets with rent increases above $25 per unit; and


(B) Budgets that are submitted late or that miss other deadlines set by the Agency.


(4) If the Agency denies the budget approval, the Agency will notify the borrower in writing.


(5) If budget approval is denied, the borrower shall continue to operate the housing project based on the most recently approved budget.
