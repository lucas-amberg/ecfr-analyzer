(a) *Payoff statements.* At the borrower's request, the Agency will provide a statement indicating the pay off amount necessary to pay the borrower's account in full.


(b) *Final payments.* A borrower's final loan payment must include repayment of all outstanding obligations to the Agency.


(1) Any supervised funds being held by the Agency will be applied to the borrower's account or, at the borrower's option, will be returned to the borrower following acceptance of final payment on all outstanding obligations.


(2) If a balance due remains on a borrower's account after Agency acceptance of a final payment, due to borrower error or fraud or Agency error, the Agency will initiate collection action in accordance with the unauthorized assistance collection procedures described in subpart O of this part.


(c) *Final payment loans.* Borrowers with loans for which the Agency approved an amortization period that exceeded the term of the loan may request a loan to finance the final payment in accordance with the requirements of § 3560.74.


(d) *Loan prepayment requests.* If prepayment of an Agency loan is requested, the applicable preservation requirements of subpart N of this part, including the execution of any appropriate restrictive-use agreements, must be met prior to the Agency's acceptance of a final loan payment under the prepayment request.


(e) *Payment forms.* Final payments may be made by cashier's check, certified check, money order, bank draft, or other withdrawal instruments approved by the Agency.


(1) If borrowers use forms of payment requiring special handling, the borrower is responsible for the cost of the special handling.


(2) When payment is provided in a form that is not the equivalent of cash, the Agency will consider the payment to be received at the time the payment has been converted to cash and funds have been transferred to the Agency.


(f) *Release of security instruments.* The Agency will release security instruments, subject to applicable restrictive-use agreements referenced in subpart N of this part, when full payment of all outstanding obligations to the Agency has been received, accepted, and the funds have been transferred to the Agency.


(1) If the Agency and the borrower agree to settle an account for less than the full amount owed, the Agency will release security instruments when the borrower has paid in full all agreed upon obligations.


(2) Recording costs for the release of the security instruments will be the responsibility of the borrower, except where state law requires the mortgagee to record or file the satisfaction.


(g) *Special circumstances—Refund of entire principal.* If the entire principal of the loan is refunded after the loan is closed, the borrower must pay interest from the date of the note to the date of receipt of the refund.
