# § 3560.452   Monetary and non-monetary defaults.

(a) *General.* Borrowers are in default when they have received a compliance violation notice, issued in accordance with § 3560.354, and have failed to correct the compliance violation identified in the compliance violation notice within the time period specified in the notice. Compliance violations include, but are not limited to, violations of promissory note provisions, loan or grant agreement provisions, regulatory, or other Agency requirements, including requirements imposed on a borrower through a workout agreement developed in accordance with § 3560.453.


(b) *Monetary defaults.* A monetary default exists when any amount due to the Agency or a third party (such as real estate taxes and insurance) under a promissory note, loan or grant agreement, workout agreement, or other agreement remains due more than 30 days after the due date.


(c) *Nonmonetary defaults.* A nonmonetary default exists when a borrower fails to correct a compliance violation, other than a monetary amount past due, within the time period specified in a compliance violation notice issued in accordance with § 3560.354. Nonmonetary defaults include, but are not limited to, failure to:


(1) Operate and manage a housing project in accordance with the Agency approved management plan or Agency requirements;


(2) Maintain the physical condition of a housing project in a decent, safe, and sanitary manner and in accordance with Agency requirements;


(3) Keep general operating expense, reserve, and other financial accounts related to a housing project at required funding levels;


(4) Occupy rental units with eligible tenants, unless granted an exception by the Agency;


(5) Charge correct rents or to correctly calculate net tenant contributions, utility allowances, or rental assistance payments or to properly administer the Agency rental assistance assigned to the housing project;


(6) Submit required annual financial reports to the Agency within time periods specified in § 3560.308;


(7) Submit management plans, leases, occupancy rules, and other required materials to the Agency in accordance with Agency requirements; and,


(8) Comply with applicable Federal laws including laws related to civil rights, fair housing, disabilities, and environmental conditions.


(d) *Default notice.* When borrowers are in default, the Agency will notify borrowers, in writing, that they are in default. The default notice will identify the compliance violation that led to the default, will specify actions necessary to cure the default, and will establish a date by which the default must be cured to preclude Agency initiation of enforcement actions, liquidation, or other actions.


(e) *Agency action.* If a borrower fails to cure a default within the time period specified in the default notice, the Agency may initiate the enforcement actions described in § 3560.461 or liquidation as described in § 3560.456. Also, Agency compliance violation notices and related default notices may be referred to Federal, state, and local agencies with jurisdictions related to the violations for handling, in accordance with their requirements.
