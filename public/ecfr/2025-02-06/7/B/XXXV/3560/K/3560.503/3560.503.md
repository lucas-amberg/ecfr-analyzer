# ยง 3560.503   Disposition of REO property.

(a) Preference will be given to offers from bidders who are determined eligible by the Agency to purchase REO property designated to be sold as program property. It is the Agency's priority that property previously operated as program property prior to becoming REO inventory property be sold as program property. However, REO property may be sold under whatever Agency program is most appropriate for the property and the community needs regardless of the program under which the property was originally financed or whether the property was being used to secure loans under more than one Agency program.


(b) When the Agency determines that the REO property to be sold is not decent, safe, and sanitary and/or does not meet cost effective energy conservation standards, it will disclose the basis for this determination to prospective purchasers. The deed by which such an REO property is conveyed will contain a covenant restricting it from residential use until it is decent, safe, and sanitary, and meets the Agency's cost effective conservation standards. The Agency will also notify any potential purchaser of any known lead based paint hazards.
