# ยง 3560.707   Program participation and corrective actions.

(a) With Agency approval, a borrower or tenant, who has received unauthorized assistance, may continue to participate in the project if they have the legal and financial capabilities to do so. Approval considerations for such forbearance and repayment are in ยง 3560.705.


(b) A borrower or tenant who was responsible for the circumstances causing the unauthorized assistance must take appropriate action to correct the problem within 90 days of the unauthorized assistance determination notice date, unless an alternative date is agreed to by the Agency.


(c) When the interest rate shown in a debt instrument resulted in the receipt of unauthorized assistance, the debt instrument will be modified to the correct interest rate. All payments made by the borrower at the incorrect interest rate will be reapplied at the correct interest rate, and remaining payments due on the loan will be recalculated on the basis of the correct interest rate, plus any amounts due to the Agency as a result of the use of an incorrect interest rate, unless the Agency agrees to a separate repayment process.
