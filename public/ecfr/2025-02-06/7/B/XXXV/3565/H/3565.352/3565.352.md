The restriction will apply unless the housing is acquired by foreclosure or an instrument in lieu of foreclosure, or the Agency waives the applicability of this requirement after determining that each of the following three circumstances exist.


(1) There is no longer a need for low-and moderate-income housing in the market area in which the housing is located;


(2) Housing opportunities for low-income households and minorities will not be reduced as a result of the waiver; and
