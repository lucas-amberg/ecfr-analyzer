DHS may charge a fee to collect biometric information, to provide biometric collection services, to conduct required national security and criminal history background checks, to verify an individual's identity, and to store and maintain this biometric information for reuse to support other benefit requests. When a biometric services fee is required, USCIS may reject a benefit request submitted without the correct biometric services fee.
