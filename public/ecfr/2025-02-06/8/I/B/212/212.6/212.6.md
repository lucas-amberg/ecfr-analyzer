(a) *Application for Form DSP-150, B-1/B-2 Visa and Border Crossing Card, issued by the Department of State.* A citizen of Mexico, who seeks to travel temporarily to the United States for business or pleasure without a visa and passport, must apply to the DOS on Form DS-156, Visitor Visa Application, to obtain a Form DSP-150 in accordance with the applicable DOS regulations at 22 CFR 41.32 and/or instructions. 


(b) *Use*—(1) *Application for admission with Non-resident Canadian Border Crossing Card, Form I-185, containing separate waiver authorization; Canadian residents bearing DOS-issued combination B-1/B-2 visa and border crossing card (or similar stamp in a passport).* (i) A Canadian citizen or other person sharing common nationality with Canada and residing in Canada who presents a Form I-185 that contains a separate notation of a waiver authorization issued pursuant to § 212.4 may be admitted on the basis of the waiver, provided the waiver has not expired or otherwise been revoked or voided. Although the waiver may remain valid on or after October 1, 2002, the non-biometric border crossing card portion of the document is not valid after that date. 


(ii) A Canadian resident who presents a combination B-1/B-2 visa and border crossing card (or similar stamp in a passport) issued by the DOS prior to April 1, 1998, that does not contain a machine-readable biometric identifier, may be admitted on the basis of the nonimmigrant visa only, provided it has not expired and the alien remains otherwise admissible. 


(2) *Application for admission by a national of Mexico—Form DSP-150 issued by the DOS; DOS-issued combination B-1/B-2 visa and border crossing card (or similar stamp in a passport).* (i) The rightful holder of a Form DSP-150 issued by the DOS may be admitted under § 235.1(f) of this chapter if found otherwise admissible and if the biometric identifier contained on the card matches the appropriate biometric characteristic of the alien.


(ii) The bearer of a combination B-1/B-2 nonimmigrant visa and border crossing card (or similar stamp in a passport) issued by DOS prior to April 1, 1998, that does not contain a machine-readable biometric identifier, may be admitted on the basis of the nonimmigrant visa only, provided it has not expired and the alien remains otherwise admissible. A passport is also required. 


(iii) Any alien seeking admission as a visitor for business or pleasure, must also present a valid passport with his or her border crossing card, and shall be issued a Form I-94 (see § 1.4) if the alien is applying for admission from: 


(A) A country other than Mexico or Canada, or 


(B) Canada if the alien has been in a country other than the United States or Canada since leaving Mexico. 


(c) *Validity.* Forms I-185, I-186, and I-586 are invalid on or after October 1, 2002. If presented on or after that date, these documents will be voided at the POE. 


(d) *Voidance for reasons other than expiration of the validity of the form*—(1) *At a POE.* (i) In accordance with 22 CFR 41.122, a Form DSP-150 or combined B-1/B-2 visitor visa and non-biometric border crossing identification card or (a similar stamp in a passport), issued by the DOS, may be physically cancelled and voided by a supervisory immigration officer at a POE if it is considered void pursuant to section 222(g) of the Act when presented at the time of application for admission, or as the alien departs the United States. If the card is considered void and if the applicant for admission is not otherwise subject to expedited removal in accordance with 8 CFR part 235, the applicant shall be advised in writing that he or she may request a hearing before an immigration judge. The purpose of the hearing shall be to determine his/her admissibility in accordance with § 235.6 of this chapter. The applicant may be represented at this hearing by an attorney of his/her own choice at no expense to the Government. He or she shall also be advised of the availability of free legal services provided by organizations and attorneys qualified under 8 CFR part 3, and organizations recognized under § 292.2 of this chapter located in the district where the removal hearing is to be held. If the applicant requests a hearing, the Form DSP-150 or combined B-1/B-2 visitor visa and non-biometric border crossing identification card (or similar stamp in a passport), issued by the DOS, shall be held by the Service for presentation to the immigration judge. 


(ii) If the applicant chooses not to have a hearing, the Form DSP-150 or combined B-1/B-2 visitor visa and non-biometric BCC (or similar stamp in a passport) issued by the DOS, shall be voided and physically cancelled. The alien to whom the card or stamp was issued by the DOS shall be notified of the action taken and the reasons for such action by means of Form I-275, Withdrawal of Application for Admission/Consular Notification, delivered in person or by mailing the Form I-275 to the last known address. The DOS shall be notified of the cancellation of the biometric Form DSP-150 or combined B-1/B-2 visitor visa and non-biometric BCC (or similar stamp in a passport) issued by DOS, by means of a copy of the original Form I-275. Nothing in this paragraph limits the Service's ability to remove an alien pursuant to 8 CFR part 235 where applicable. 


(2) *Within the United States.* In accordance with former section 242 of the Act (before amended by section 306 of the IIRIRA of 1996, Div. C, Public Law 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (Sept. 30, 1996,) or current sections 235(b), 238, and 240 of the Act, if the holder of a Form DSP-150, or other combined B-1/B-2 visa and BCC, or (similar stamp in a passport) issued by the DOS, is placed under removal proceedings, no action to cancel the card or stamp shall be taken pending the outcome of the hearing. If the alien is ordered removed or granted voluntary departure, the card or stamp shall be physically cancelled and voided by an immigration officer. In the case of an alien holder of a BCC who is granted voluntary departure without a hearing, the card shall be declared void and physically cancelled by an immigration officer who is authorized to issue a Notice to Appear or to grant voluntary departure. 


(3) *In Mexico or Canada.* Forms I-185, I-186 or I-586 issued by the Service and which are now invalid, or a Form DSP-150 or combined B-1/B-2 visitor visa and non-biometric BCC, or (similar stamp in a passport) issued by the DOS may be declared void by United States consular officers or United States immigration officers in Mexico or Canada. 


(4) *Grounds.* Grounds for voidance of a Form I-185, I-186, I-586, a DOS-issued non-biometric BCC, or the biometric Form DSP-150 shall be that the holder has violated the immigration laws; that he/she is inadmissible to the United States; that he/she has abandoned his/her residence in the country upon which the card was granted; or if the BCC is presented for admission on or after October 1, 2002, it does not contain a machine-readable biometric identifier corresponding to the bearer and is invalid on or after October 1, 2002. 


(e) *Replacement.* If a valid Border Crossing Card (Forms I-185, I-186, or I-586) previously issued by the Service, a non-biometric border crossing card issued by the DOS before April 1998, or a Form DSP-150 issued by the DOS has been lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed, the person to whom the card was issued may apply for a new card as provided for in the DOS regulations found at 22 CFR 41.32 and 22 CFR 41.103.
