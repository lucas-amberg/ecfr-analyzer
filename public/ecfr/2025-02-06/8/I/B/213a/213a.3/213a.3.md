# § 213a.3   Change of address.

(a) *Submission of address change*—(1) *Filing requirements.* If the address of a sponsor (including a substitute sponsor or joint sponsor) changes while the sponsor's support obligation is in effect, the sponsor shall file a change of address notice within 30 days, in a manner as prescribed by USCIS on its address change form instructions.


(2) *Proof of mailing.* USCIS will accept a photocopy of the change of address form together with proof of the form's delivery to USCIS as evidence that the sponsor has complied with this requirement.


(3) *Electronic notices.* USCIS will provide the sponsor with a receipt notice for an address change.


(4) *Alien sponsors.* If the sponsor is an alien, the sponsor must still comply with the requirements of 8 CFR 265.1 to notify USCIS of his or her change of address.


(b) *Civil penalty.* If the sponsor fails to give notice in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, DHS may impose on the sponsor a civil penalty in an amount within the penalty range established in section 213A(d)(2)(A) of the Act. Except, if the sponsor, knowing that the sponsored immigrant has received any means-tested public benefit, fails to give notice in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, DHS may impose on the sponsor a civil penalty in an amount within the penalty range established in section 213A(d)(2)(B) of the Act. The procedure for imposing a civil penalty is established at 8 CFR part 280.
