# ยง 214.209   Extreme hardship involving unusual and severe harm.

To be eligible for T-1 nonimmigrant status, an applicant must demonstrate that removal from the United States would subject the applicant to extreme hardship involving unusual and severe harm.


(a) *Standard.* A finding of extreme hardship involving unusual and severe harm may be based on the following factors.


(b) *Factors.* Factors that may be considered in evaluating whether removal would result in extreme hardship involving unusual and severe harm should include both traditional extreme hardship factors and factors associated with having been a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons. These factors include, but are not limited to:


(1) The age, maturity, and personal circumstances of the applicant;


(2) Any physical or psychological issues the applicant has that necessitate medical or psychological care not reasonably available in the foreign country to which the applicant would be returned;


(3) The nature and extent of the physical and psychological consequences of having been a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons;


(4) The impact of the loss of access to the United States courts and the criminal justice system for purposes relating to the incident of a severe form of trafficking in persons or other crimes perpetrated against the applicant, including criminal and civil redress for acts of trafficking in persons, criminal prosecution, restitution, and protection;


(5) The reasonable expectation that the existence of laws, social practices, or customs in the foreign country to which the applicant would be returned would penalize the applicant severely for having been the victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons;


(6) The likelihood of re-victimization and the need, ability, and willingness of foreign authorities to protect the applicant;


(7) The likelihood that the trafficker or others acting on behalf of the trafficker in the foreign country would cause the applicant harm;


(8) The likelihood that the applicant's individual safety would be threatened by the existence of civil unrest or armed conflict; or


(9) Current or likelihood of future economic harm.


(c) *Evidence.* (1) An applicant is encouraged to describe and document all factors that may be relevant to the case, as there is no guarantee that a particular reason(s) will satisfy the requirement.


(2) Hardship to persons other than the applicant may be considered in determining whether an applicant will suffer the requisite hardship only if the related evidence demonstrates specifically that the applicant will suffer extreme hardship upon removal as a result of hardship to persons other than the applicant.


(3) The applicant may satisfy this requirement by submitting any credible evidence regarding the nature and scope of the hardship if the applicant was removed from the United States, including evidence of hardship arising from circumstances surrounding the victimization and any other circumstances.


(4) An applicant may submit a personal statement or other evidence, including evidence from relevant country condition reports and any other public or private sources of information.
