# § 214.211   Application for eligible family members.

(a) *Eligibility.* Subject to section 214(o) of the Act, an applicant who has applied for or has been granted T-1 nonimmigrant status (principal applicant) may apply for the admission of an eligible family member, who is otherwise admissible to the United States, in derivative T nonimmigrant status if accompanying or following to join the principal applicant.


(1) *Principal applicant 21 years of age or older.* For a principal applicant who is 21 years of age or over, eligible family member means a T-2 (spouse) or T-3 (child).


(2) *Principal applicant under 21 years of age.* For a principal applicant who is under 21 years of age, eligible family member means a T-2 (spouse), T-3 (child), T-4 (parent), or T-5 (unmarried sibling under the age of 18).


(3) *Family member facing danger of retaliation.* Regardless of the age of the principal applicant, if the eligible family member faces a present danger of retaliation as a result of the principal applicant's escape from the severe form of trafficking or cooperation with law enforcement, in consultation with the law enforcement agency investigating a severe form of trafficking, eligible family member means a T-4 (parent), T-5 (unmarried sibling under the age of 18), or T-6 (adult or minor child of a derivative of the principal applicant). In cases where the LEA has not investigated the acts of trafficking after the applicant has reported the crime, USCIS will evaluate any credible evidence demonstrating derivatives' present danger of retaliation.


(4) *Admission requirements.* The principal applicant must demonstrate that the applicant for whom derivative T nonimmigrant status is being sought is an eligible family member of the T-1 principal applicant, as defined in § 214.201, and is otherwise eligible for that status.


(b) *Application.* (1) *Application submission.* A T-1 principal applicant may submit an Application for Derivative T Nonimmigrant Status in accordance with the form instructions.


(i) The Application for Derivative T Nonimmigrant Status for an eligible family member may be filed with the T-1 application, or separately.


(ii) T nonimmigrant status for eligible family members is dependent on the principal applicant having been granted T-1 nonimmigrant status and the principal applicant maintaining T-1 nonimmigrant status.


(iii) If a T-1 nonimmigrant cannot maintain status due to their death, the provisions of section 204(l) of the Act may apply.


(2) *Eligible family members in pending immigration proceedings.* (i) If an eligible family member is in removal proceedings under section 240 of the Act, or in exclusion or deportation proceedings under former sections 236 or 242 of the Act (as in effect prior to April 1, 1997), the principal applicant or T-1 nonimmigrant must file an Application for Derivative T Nonimmigrant Status directly with USCIS.


(ii) At the request of the eligible family member, ICE may exercise prosecutorial discretion, as appropriate, while USCIS adjudicates an Application for Derivative T Nonimmigrant Status.


(3) *Eligible family members with final orders of removal, deportation, or exclusion.* (i) If an eligible family member is the subject of a final order of removal, deportation, or exclusion, the principal applicant must file an Application for Derivative T Nonimmigrant Status directly with USCIS.


(ii) The filing of an Application for Derivative T Nonimmigrant Status has no effect on ICE's authority or discretion to execute a final order, although the applicant may file a request for an administrative stay of removal pursuant to 8 CFR 241.6(a).


(iii) If the eligible family member is in detention pending execution of the final order, the period of detention (under the standards of 8 CFR 241.4) will be extended while a stay is in effect for the period reasonably necessary to bring about the applicant's removal.


(c) *Required supporting evidence.* In addition to the form, an Application for Derivative T Nonimmigrant Status must include the following:


(1) Biometrics.


(2) Evidence demonstrating the relationship of an eligible family member, as provided in § 214.211(d).


(3) In the case of an applicant seeking derivative T nonimmigrant status based on danger of retaliation, evidence demonstrating this danger as provided in § 214.211.


(4) If an eligible family member is inadmissible based on a ground that may be waived, a request for a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(d)(13) or section 212(d)(3) of the Act must be filed in accordance with § 212.16 of this subchapter and submitted with the completed application package.


(d) *Relationship.* Except as described in paragraph (e) of this section, the family relationship must exist at the time:


(1) The Application for T Nonimmigrant Status is filed;


(2) The Application for T Nonimmigrant Status is adjudicated;


(3) The Application for Derivative T Nonimmigrant Status is filed;


(4) The Application for Derivative T Nonimmigrant Status is adjudicated; and


(5) The eligible family member is admitted to the United States if residing abroad.


(e) *Relationship and age-out protections*—(1) *Protection for new child of a principal applicant.* If the T-1 principal applicant establishes that they have become a parent of a child after filing the application for T-1 nonimmigrant status, the child will be deemed to be an eligible family member eligible to accompany or follow to join the T-1 principal applicant.


(2) *Age-out protection for eligible family members of a principal applicant under 21 years of age.* (i) If the T-1 principal applicant was under 21 years of age when they applied for T-1 nonimmigrant status but reached 21 years of age while the principal application was still pending, USCIS will continue to consider a parent or unmarried sibling as an eligible family member.


(ii) A parent or unmarried sibling will remain eligible even if the principal applicant turns 21 years of age before adjudication of the application for T-1 nonimmigrant status.


(iii) An unmarried sibling will remain eligible even if the unmarried sibling is over 18 years of age at the time of adjudication of the T-1 application, so long as the unmarried sibling was under 18 years of age at the time the T-1 application was filed.


(iv) The age of an unmarried sibling when USCIS adjudicates the T-1 application, when the principal applicant or T-1 nonimmigrant files the Application for Derivative T Nonimmigrant Status, when USCIS adjudicates the derivative application, or when the unmarried sibling is admitted to the United States does not affect eligibility.


(3) *Age-out protection for child of a principal applicant.* (i) USCIS will continue to consider a child as an eligible family member if the child was under 21 years of age at the time the principal filed the Application for T Nonimmigrant Status, but reached 21 years of age while the principal's application was still pending.


(ii) The child will remain eligible even if the child is over 21 years of age at the time of adjudication of the T-1 application.


(iii) As long as the child is under age 21 when the Application for T Nonimmigrant Status is filed and reaches age 21 while such application is pending, the age of the child when the principal applicant or T-1 nonimmigrant files the Application for Derivative T Nonimmigrant Status, when USCIS adjudicates the Application for Derivative T Nonimmigrant Status, or when the child is admitted to the United States does not affect eligibility.


(4) *Marriage of an eligible family member.* (i) An eligible family member seeking T-3 or T-5 status must be unmarried when the principal applicant files an Application for T Nonimmigrant Status, when USCIS adjudicates the Application for T Nonimmigrant Status, when the principal applicant or T-1 nonimmigrant files the Application for Derivative T Nonimmigrant Status, when USCIS adjudicates the Derivative T Nonimmigrant Status, and if relevant, when the family member is admitted to the United States.


(ii) Principal applicants who marry while their Application for T Nonimmigrant Status is pending may file an Application for Derivative T Nonimmigrant Status on behalf of their spouse, even if the relationship did not exist at the time they filed their Application for T Nonimmigrant Status.


(iii) Similarly, the principal applicant may apply for a stepparent or stepchild if the qualifying relationship was created after they filed their Application for T Nonimmigrant Status but before it was approved.


(iv) USCIS evaluates whether the marriage creating the qualifying spousal relationship or stepchild and stepparent relationship exists at the time of adjudication of the principal's application and through completion of the adjudication of the derivative's application.


(f) *Evidence demonstrating a present danger of retaliation.* A principal applicant or T-1 nonimmigrant seeking derivative T nonimmigrant status for an eligible family member on the basis of facing a present danger of retaliation as a result of the principal applicant's or T-1 nonimmigrant's escape from a severe form of trafficking or cooperation with law enforcement, must demonstrate the basis of this danger. USCIS may contact the LEA involved, if appropriate. An applicant may satisfy this requirement by submitting:


(1) Documentation of a previous grant of advance parole to an eligible family member;


(2) A signed statement from a law enforcement agency describing the danger of retaliation;


(3) A personal statement from the principal applicant or derivative applicant describing the danger the family member faces and how the danger is linked to the victim's escape or cooperation with law enforcement; and/or


(4) Any other credible evidence, including trial transcripts, court documents, police reports, news articles, copies of reimbursement forms for travel to and from court, and affidavits from other witnesses. This evidence may be from the United States or any country in which the eligible family member is facing danger of retaliation.


(g) *Biometric submission; evidentiary standards.* The provisions for biometric submission and evidentiary standards described in § 214.204(b) and (d) apply to an eligible family member's Application for Derivative T Nonimmigrant Status.


(h) *Review and decision.* USCIS will review the application and issue a decision in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.


(i) *Derivative approvals.* A noncitizen whose Application for Derivative T Nonimmigrant Status is approved is not subject to the annual limit described in § 214.210. USCIS will not approve an Application for Derivative T Nonimmigrant Status unless and until it has approved T-1 nonimmigrant status for the principal applicant.


(1) *Approvals for eligible family members in the United States.* When USCIS approves an Application for Derivative T Nonimmigrant Status for an eligible family member in the United States, USCIS will concurrently approve T nonimmigrant status for the eligible family member. USCIS will notify the T-1 nonimmigrant of such approval and provide evidence of T nonimmigrant status to the derivative.


(2) *Approvals for eligible family members outside the United States.* When USCIS approves an application for an eligible family member outside the United States, USCIS will notify the T-1 nonimmigrant of such approval and provide the necessary documentation to the Department of State for consideration of visa issuance.


(3) *Employment authorization.* (i) A noncitizen granted derivative T nonimmigrant status may apply for employment authorization by filing an Application for Employment Authorization in accordance with form instructions.


(ii) For derivatives in the United States, the Application for Employment Authorization may be filed concurrently with the Application for Derivative T Nonimmigrant Status or at any later time.


(iii) For derivatives outside the United States, an Application for Employment Authorization based on their T nonimmigrant status may only be filed after admission to the United States in T nonimmigrant status.


(iv) If the Application for Employment Authorization is approved, the derivative T nonimmigrant will be granted employment authorization pursuant to 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(25) for the period remaining in derivative T nonimmigrant status.


(4) *Travel abroad.* In order to return to the United States after travel abroad and continue to hold derivative T nonimmigrant status, a noncitizen granted derivative T nonimmigrant status must either be granted advance parole pursuant to section 212(d)(5) of the Act and 8 CFR 223 or obtain a T nonimmigrant visa (unless visa exempt under 8 CFR 212.1) and be admitted as a T nonimmigrant at a designated port of entry.
