# ยง 214.213   Revocation of approved T nonimmigrant status.

(a) *Automatic revocation of derivative status.* An approved Application for Derivative T Nonimmigrant Status will be revoked automatically if the family member with an approved derivative application notifies USCIS that they will not apply for admission to the United States. An automatic revocation cannot be appealed.


(b) *Revocation on notice/grounds for revocation.* USCIS may revoke an approved Application for T Nonimmigrant Status following issuance of a notice of intent to revoke if:


(1) The approval of the application violated the requirements of section 101(a)(15)(T) of the Act or this subpart or involved error in preparation, procedure, or adjudication that led to the approval;


(2) In the case of a T-2 spouse, the applicant's divorce from the T-1 principal applicant has become final;


(3) In the case of a T-1 principal applicant, an LEA with jurisdiction to detect, investigate, or prosecute the acts of severe forms of trafficking in persons notifies USCIS that the applicant has refused to comply with a reasonable request to assist with the detection, investigation, or prosecution of the trafficking in persons and provides USCIS with a detailed explanation in writing; or


(4) The LEA that signed the LEA declaration withdraws it or disavows its contents and notifies USCIS and provides a detailed explanation of its reasoning in writing.


(c) *Procedures.* (1) USCIS may revoke an approved application for T nonimmigrant status following a notice of intent to revoke.


(i) The notice of intent to revoke must be in writing and contain a statement of the grounds for the revocation and the time period allowed for the T nonimmigrant's rebuttal.


(ii) The T nonimmigrant may submit evidence in rebuttal within 30 days of the notice.


(iii) USCIS will consider all relevant evidence in determining whether to revoke the approved application for T nonimmigrant status.


(2) If USCIS revokes approval of the previously granted T nonimmigrant status application, USCIS:


(i) Will provide written notice to the applicant; and


(ii) May notify the LEA who signed the LEA declaration, any consular officer having jurisdiction over the applicant, or the Office of Refugee Resettlement of the Department of Health and Human Services.


(3) If an applicant appeals the revocation, the decision will not become final until the administrative appeal is decided in accordance with 8 CFR 103.3.


(d) *Effect of revocation.* Revocation of T-1 nonimmigrant status will terminate the principal's status as a T nonimmigrant and result in automatic termination of any derivative T nonimmigrant status. If a derivative application is pending at the time of revocation of T-1 nonimmigrant status, such pending applications will be denied. Revocation of a T-1 nonimmigrant status or derivative T nonimmigrant status also revokes any waiver of inadmissibility granted in conjunction with such application. The revocation of T-1 nonimmigrant status will have no effect on the annual numerical limit described in ยง 214.210.
