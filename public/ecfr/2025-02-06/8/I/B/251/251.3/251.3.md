# ยง 251.3   Departure manifests and lists for vessels.

(a) *Form I-418, Passenger List-Crew List.* Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the master or agent of every vessel departing from the United States directly to some foreign place or outlying possession of the United States must electronically submit the data elements required on Form I-418 via an electronic data interchange system approved by CBP, except when a manifest is not required pursuant to section 251.1(a). Submission of inaccurate or incomplete data will be regarded as lack of compliance with section 251(c) of the Act.


(b) *Exception for certain Great Lakes vessels.* The required list need not be submitted for Canadian or British crewmembers of Great Lakes vessels described in ยง 251.1(a)(3).


(c) *Exception to the requirement to submit Form I-418 data elements electronically.* The master or agent of any vessel that is departing from the United States directly to some foreign place or outlying possession of the United States, and is required to submit a manifest, may submit a paper Form I-418 to CBP at the port from which such vessel is to depart when:


(1) The master or agent of the vessel is unable to submit the data elements required on Form I-418 electronically via an electronic data interchange system approved by CBP because there is no internet access in that location or onboard computers are experiencing technical difficulties, and there is no shore-side support available; or


(2) CBP is experiencing technical difficulties affecting its receipt or processing of electronically submitted information, or, in its discretion, CBP determines that a paper Form I-418 is acceptable under the circumstances presented by the master or agent of a vessel.
