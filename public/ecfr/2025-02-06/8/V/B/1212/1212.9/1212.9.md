# ยง 1212.9   Applicability of section 212(a)(32) to certain derivative third and sixth preference and nonpreference immigrants.

A derivative beneficiary who is the spouse or child of a qualified third or sixth preference or nonpreference immigrant and who is also a graduate of a medical school as defined by section 101(a)(41) of the Act is not considered to be an alien who is coming to the United States principally to perform services as a member of the medical profession. Therefore, a derivative third or sixth preference or nonpreference immigrant under section 203(a)(8) of the Act, who is also a graduate of a medical school, is eligible for an immigrant visa or for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Act, whether or not such derivative immigrant has passed Parts I and II of the National Board of Medical Examiners Examination or equivalent examination.
