Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an alien who is deportable because of a conviction on or after November 18, 1988, for an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43) of the Act, shall not be eligible for voluntary departure as prescribed in 8 CFR part 1240 and section 244 of the Act.

An application for suspension of deportation shall be made on Form EOIR-40.
