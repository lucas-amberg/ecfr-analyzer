# ยง 1249.3   Reopening and reconsideration.

An applicant who alleged entry and residence since prior to July 1, 1924, but in whose case a record was created as of the date of approval of the application because evidence of continuous residence prior to July 1, 1924, was not submitted, may have his case reopened and reconsidered pursuant to ยง 103.5 of 8 CFR chapter I. Upon the submission of satisfactory evidence, a record of admission as of the date of alleged entry may be created.
