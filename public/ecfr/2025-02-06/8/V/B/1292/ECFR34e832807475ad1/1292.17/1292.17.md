(a) *In general.* The Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) may administratively terminate an organization's recognition or a representative's accreditation and remove the organization or representative from the recognition and accreditation roster. Prior to issuing a determination to administratively terminate recognition or accreditation, the Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) may request, in writing or electronically, information from the organization, representative, DHS, or EOIR, regarding the bases for termination. The Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate), in writing or electronically, shall inform the organization or the representative, as applicable, of the determination to terminate the organization's recognition or the representative's accreditation, and the reasons for the determination.

(d) *Request for reconsideration.* An organization whose recognition is terminated pursuant to paragraph (b)(5) or (6) of this section or the accreditation of its representative(s) is terminated pursuant to paragraph (c)(6) of this section may make one request for reconsideration of the disapproval within 30 days of the determination. The recognition of the organization and the accreditation of any representatives for whom the organization timely requests reconsideration shall remain valid pending the Assistant Director for Policy's (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate's) consideration of the reconsideration request. The Assistant Director for Policy (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate) is authorized to allow requests and determinations described in this paragraph to be made electronically.


(e) *Effect of administrative termination of recognition.* The Assistant Director for Policy's (or the Assistant Director for Policy's delegate's) determination to terminate recognition is final as of the date of service of the administrative termination notice. Upon service or electronic delivery of an administrative termination of recognition notice to the organization's accredited representatives by the Office of Policy, the organization's representatives shall no longer be authorized to represent clients before the Immigration Courts, the Board, or DHS on behalf of that organization, but the notice shall not affect an individual's accreditation through another recognized organization unless otherwise specified. An organization whose recognition is terminated may submit a new request for recognition at any time after its termination unless otherwise prohibited.
