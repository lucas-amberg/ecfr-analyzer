2, or shall be identified by a distinctive and legible tattoo marking acceptable to and approved by the Administrator.

3; or


(ii) By a distinctive and legible tattoo marking approved by the Administrator. 


(2) If any live dog or cat is already identified by an official tag or tattoo which has been applied by another dealer or exhibitor, the dealer or exhibitor who purchases or otherwise acquires the animal may continue identifying the dog or cat by the previous identification number, or may replace the previous tag with his own official tag or approved tattoo.
