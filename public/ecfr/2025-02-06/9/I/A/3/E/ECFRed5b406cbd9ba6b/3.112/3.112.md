A copy of the certificate must accompany the shipment to destination. The certificate must include at least the following information: 


(1) Name and address of the consignor; 


(2) The number, age, and sex of animals in the shipment;

(4) The signature of the attending veterinarian and the date. 


(d) Carriers and intermediate handlers must attempt to notify the consignee (receiving party) at least once in every 6-hour period following the arrival of any marine mammals at the animal holding area of the terminal cargo facility.
