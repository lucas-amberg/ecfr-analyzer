(a) The claimant must ensure that goats, sheep, and horses infected with or exposed to *B. abortus* are either:


(1) Sold under permit to a recognized slaughtering establishment;


(2) Moved to an approved stockyard for sale to a recognized slaughtering establishment; or


(3) Destroyed and buried, incinerated, or rendered in accordance with applicable State law.


(b) The claimant must ensure that goats and sheep destroyed because of *B. melitensis* are destroyed and buried, incinerated, or rendered in accordance with applicable State law.


(c) Indemnity will be paid under this part only if the animals are destroyed within 15 days after the date they are marked with identification showing they are to be destroyed. However, the Veterinarian in Charge may extend the time limit to 30 days if:


(1) The animals' owner asks the Veterinarian in Charge for an extension before the initial 15-day period expires, or the animals were sold for slaughter before the original 15-day period expires; and


(2) The Veterinarian in Charge determines that extending the time limit will not adversely affect the Brucellosis Eradication Program.


(d) The Administrator may extend the time limit beyond 30 days when unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur that prevent or hinder the destruction of the animals within 30 days, such as, but not limited to, floods, storms, or other Acts of God, which are beyond the control of the owner, or when destruction is delayed due to requirements of another Federal agency.
