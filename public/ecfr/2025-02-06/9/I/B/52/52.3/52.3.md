# ยง 52.3   Appraisal of swine.

(a) Herds of swine and individual breeding sows to be destroyed because they are known to be infected with pseudorabies will be appraised by an APHIS employee and a representative of the State jointly, a representative of the State alone, or, if the State authorities approve, by an APHIS employee alone. 


(b) The appraisal of swine will be based on the fair market value as determined by the meat or breeding value of the animals. Animals may be appraised in groups, provided that where appraisal is by the head, each animal in the group is the same value per head, and where appraisal is by the pound, each animal in the group is the same value per pound.


(c) Appraisals of swine must be reported on forms furnished by APHIS and signed by the owner of the swine. Reports of appraisals must show the number of swine and the value per head or the weight and value by pound.
