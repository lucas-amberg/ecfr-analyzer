# § 77.40   Procedures for and interstate movement to necropsy and slaughter.

(a) *Procedures for necropsy and slaughter.* (1) A necropsy must be performed by or under the supervision of a veterinarian who is employed by USDA or employed by the State in which the captive cervid was classified, and who is trained in tuberculosis necropsy procedures. 


(2) If, upon necropsy, a captive cervid is found without evidence of *M. bovis* infection by histopathology and culture, the captive cervid will be considered negative for tuberculosis. 


(3) Reactors, suspects, and exposed captive cervids may be slaughtered only at a recognized slaughtering establishment, as defined in § 77.20. 


(b) *Interstate movement to necropsy or slaughter*—(1) *Permit.* Any reactor, suspect, or exposed captive cervid to be moved interstate to necropsy or slaughter must be accompanied by a permit issued by a representative of APHIS, a State representative, or an accredited veterinarian. The captive cervid must remain on the premises where it was identified as a reactor, suspect, or exposed captive cervid until a permit for its movement is obtained. No stopover or diversion from the destination listed on the permit is allowed. If a change in destination becomes necessary, a new permit must be obtained from a cooperating State or Federal animal health official or an accredited veterinarian before the interstate movement begins. The permit must list: 


(i) The classification of the captive cervid (reactor, suspect, or exposed); 


(ii) The reactor eartag number or, for suspects and exposed captive cervids, the official eartag or other approved identification number; 


(iii) The owner's name and address; 


(iv) The origin and destination of the captive cervids; 


(v) The number of captive cervids covered by the permit; and 


(vi) The purpose of the movement. 


(2) *Identification of reactors.* Reactors must be tagged with an official eartag attached to the left ear and bearing a serial number and the inscription “U.S. Reactor,” and either: 


(i) Branded with the letter “T” high on the left hip near the tailhead and at least 5 by 5 centimeters (2 by 2 inches) in size; or 


(ii) Permanently identified by the letters “TB” tattooed legibly in the left ear, sprayed on the left ear with yellow paint, and either accompanied directly to necropsy or slaughter by an APHIS or State representative or moved directly to necropsy or slaughter in a vehicle closed with official seals. Such official seals must be applied and removed by an APHIS representative, State representative, accredited veterinarian, or an individual authorized for this purpose by an APHIS representative. 


(3) *Identification of exposed captive cervids.* Exposed captive cervids must be identified by an official eartag or other approved identification and either: 


(i) Branded with the letter “S” high on the left hip near the tailhead and at least 5 by 5 centimeters (2 by 2 inches) in size; or 


(ii) Either accompanied directly to necropsy or slaughter by an APHIS or State representative or moved directly to necropsy or slaughter in a vehicle closed with official seals. Such official seals must be applied and removed by an APHIS representative, State representative, accredited veterinarian, or an individual authorized for this purpose by an APHIS representative.
