# § 88.3   Standards for conveyances.

(a) The animal cargo space of conveyances used for the commercial transportation of equines for slaughter must:


(1) Be designed, constructed, and maintained in a manner that at all times protects the health and well-being of the equines being transported (e.g., provides adequate ventilation, contains no sharp protrusions, etc.);


(2) Include means of completely segregating each stallion and each aggressive equine on the conveyance so that no stallion or aggressive equine can come into contact with any of the other equines on the conveyance;


(3) Have sufficient interior height to allow each equine on the conveyance to stand with its head extended to the fullest normal postural height; and


(4) Be equipped with doors and ramps of sufficient size and location to provide for safe loading and unloading.


(b) Equines for slaughter must not be transported in any conveyance that has the animal cargo space divided into two or more stacked levels, except that conveyances lacking the capability to convert from two or more stacked levels to one level may be used until December 7, 2006. Conveyances with collapsible floors (also known as “floating decks”) must be configured to transport equines on one level only.
