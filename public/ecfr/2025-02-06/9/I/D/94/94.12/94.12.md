# § 94.12   Pork and pork products from regions where swine vesicular disease exists.

(a) APHIS considers swine vesicular disease to exist in all regions of the world except those declared free of the disease by APHIS.


(1) A list of regions that APHIS has declared free of swine vesicular disease is maintained on the APHIS website at *https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-and-animal-product-import-information/animal-health-status-of-regions.* Copies of the list are also available via postal mail upon request to Regionalization Evaluation Services, Strategy and Policy, Veterinary Services, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, 4700 River Road, Unit 38, Riverdale, Maryland 20737; *AskRegionalization@usda.gov.*

(2) APHIS will add a region to the list of those it has declared free of swine vesicular disease after it conducts an evaluation of the region in accordance with § 92.2 of this subchapter and finds that the disease is not present. In the case of a region formerly on this list that is removed due to an outbreak, the region may be returned to the list in accordance with the procedures for reestablishment of a region's disease-free status in § 92.4 of this subchapter. APHIS will remove a region from the list of those it has declared free of swine vesicular disease upon determining that the disease exists in the region based on reports APHIS receives of outbreaks of the disease from veterinary officials of the exporting country, from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), or from other sources the Administrator determines to be reliable.


(b) No pork or pork product may be imported into the United States from any region where swine vesicular disease is known to exist unless it complies with the following requirements and it is not otherwise prohibited importation into the United States under this part:


(1) Such pork or pork product has been treated in accordance with one of the following procedures: 


(i) Such pork or pork product has been fully cooked by a commercial method in a container hermetically sealed promptly after filling, but before such cooking, so that such cooking and sealing produced a fully sterilized product which is shelf-stable without refrigeration. 


(ii) Such pork or pork product is in compliance with the following requirements: 


(A) All bones were completely removed prior to cooking; and


(B) Such pork or pork product received heat treatment in a commercially accepted manner used for perishable canned pork products so that it reached an internal temperature of 69 °C. (156 °F.) throughout.


(iii) Such pork or pork product if cured and dried is in compliance with the following requirements: 


(A) All bones have been completely removed in the region of origin, and 


(B) Such pork or pork products shall be consigned directly from the port of entry in the United States to a meat processing establishment operating under Federal meat inspection and approved by the Administrator, 
12 for heating to an internal temperature of 166 °F. During movement from the port of entry to the meat processing establishment, the pork or pork products must be moved under Department seals or seals of the U.S. Customs Service, and shall be otherwise handled as the Administrator may direct in order to guard against the introduction and dissemination of swine vesicular disease. Seals applied under this section may not be broken except by persons authorized by the Administrator to do so.


(iv) Such pork or pork product, if it originated in a swine vesicular disease free region, has been cured and dried and is in compliance with the following requirements: 


(A) All bones have been completely removed, either in the region of origin or in the region where the pork or pork products are processed; and 


(B)(*1*) Such pork or pork product is accompanied from the swine vesicular disease free region of origin to the processing establishment in the swine vesicular disease affected region by a certificate signed by an official of the National Government of the swine vesicular disease free region of origin specifying that the pork or pork product involved originated in that region and the pork or pork product was consigned to a processing establishment in ____________ (a region not listed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section as free of swine vesicular disease), in a closed container sealed by the national veterinary authorities of the swine vesicular disease free region of origin by seals of a serially numbered type. The numbers of these seals shall be entered on this certificate; and 


(*2*) The certificate required by paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall also state that: 


(*i*) The container seals specified in paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(B)(*1*) of this section were found intact and free of any evidence of tampering on arrival at the processing establishment in the swine vesicular disease affected region by a national veterinary inspector of that region, 


(*ii*) The processing establishment from which the pork or pork product was shipped to the United States does not receive or process any live swine, and uses only pork or pork products which originate in regions listed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section as free of swine vesicular disease; and 


(*iii*) That such establishment processes all such pork or pork products in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this section. 


(v) Such pork or pork product is in compliance with the following requirements:


(A) All bones were completely removed prior to cooking; and


(B) Such pork or pork product received continual heat treatment in an oven for a minimum of 10 hours so that it reached an internal temperature of 65 °C. (149 °F.) throughout. The oven temperature started at a minimum of 62 °C. (143.6 °F.) and reached at least 85 °C. (185 °F.).


(vi) Pork rind pellets (pork skins) must be cooked in one of the following ways:


(A) *One-step process.* The pork skins must be cooked in oil for at least 80 minutes when oil temperature is consistently maintained at a minimum of 114 °C.


(B) *Two-step process.* The pork skins must be dry-cooked at a minimum of 260 °C for approximately 210 minutes after which they must be cooked in hot oil (deep-fried) at a minimum of 104 °C for an additional 150 minutes.


(2) Articles under paragraph (b)(1)(ii), (iii) or (iv) of this section were prepared in an inspected establishment that is eligible to have its products imported into the United States under the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the regulations in § 327.2 in chapter III of this title. 


(3) In addition to the foreign meat inspection certificate required in § 327.4 of this title, pork or pork products prepared under paragraph (b)(1)(ii), (iii) or (iv) of this section shall be accompanied by certification that paragraph (b)(1)(ii), (b)(1)(iii)(A), or (b)(1)(iv)(B)(2) of this section has been met. The certification shall be issued by an official of the national government of the region of origin who is authorized to issue the foreign meat inspection certificate required by § 327.4 of this title. 
13 Upon arrival of the pork or pork products in the United States, the certificate must be presented to an authorized inspector at the port of arrival.


(4) Small amounts of pork or pork product subject to the restrictions of this section, may in specific cases be imported for purposes of examination, testing, or analysis, if the importer applies for and receives written approval for such importation from the Administrator, authorizing such importation. Approval will be granted only when the Administrator determines that the articles have been processed by heat in a manner so that such importation will not endanger the livestock of the United States. 


(c) *Requirements for pork-filled pasta products from regions affected with swine vesicular disease.* (1) Pork-filled pasta products processed for export to the United States may only be filled with pork or pork products that are otherwise eligible to be exported to the United States and that meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i), (ii), or (v) of this section or of § 94.17. 


(2) The operator of the pork-filled pasta processing facility must have signed a cooperative service agreement with APHIS prior to receipt of the pork intended to be used in pork-filled pasta products, stating that all such pork will be processed only in accordance with § 94.12 or § 94.17. Pursuant to the cooperative service agreement, the establishment must allow the unannounced entry into the establishment of APHIS representatives, or other persons authorized by the Administrator, for the purpose of inspecting the facilities, operations, and records of the establishment. The establishment must be current in paying all costs for such inspections (it is anticipated that such inspections will occur up to four times per year). These costs include travel, salary, subsistence, administrative overhead, and other incidental expenses (including an excess baggage provision up to 150 pounds). In accordance with the terms of the cooperative service agreement, the operator of the processing establishment must deposit with the Administrator an amount equal to the approximate costs for APHIS to inspect the establishment one time, including travel, salary, subsistence, administrative overhead and other incidental expenses (including an excess baggage provision up to 150 pounds), and, as funds from that amount are obligated, bills for costs incurred based on official accounting records will be issued to restore the deposit to its original level. Amounts to restore the deposit to its original level must be paid within 14 days of receipt of such bills. 


(3) At the pasta processing establishment, pork intended to be used for pork-filled pasta products for export to the United States must be stored apart from any meat or meat products not eligible for export to the United States, either in a separate storage room or facility or in a separate area of the same storage room. Any storage room area reserved for pork or pork products eligible for export to the United States must be separated by at least 1 meter from any storage room area where meat or meat products ineligible for export to the United States are stored and must be marked by signs and by having its borders outlined on the floor. 


(4) Prior to handling pork used for pork-filled pasta products intended for export to the United States, workers at the processing facility who handle pork or pork products in the facility must shower and put on a full set of clean clothes, or wait 24 hours after handling pork or pork products that are not eligible for importation into the United States. 


(5) All equipment and machinery that will come in contact with the pork or other ingredients of pork-filled pasta products intended for export to the United States must be cleaned and disinfected before each use. 


(6) Processing lines working with pork-filled pasta products for export to the United States must be totally dedicated to the production of such products for the time needed to complete a given lot. When any processing line in a facility is working with pork-filled pasta products intended for export to the United States, no other processing lines in the same facility may work on products using meat that is not eligible for export to the United States. 


(7) Processing facilities that are completely dedicated to producing only pork-filled pasta products for export to the United States and do not receive, handle, or process any animal product not intended for export to the United States are exempt from the requirements of paragraphs (c)(3) through (c)(6) of this section. 


(8) During processing, the pork-filled pasta must be steam-heated to a minimum internal temperature of 90 °C, then dried, cooled, and packed to make the product shelf stable without refrigeration. 


(9) The processing facility must maintain under lock and key, for a minimum of 2 years, an original record of each lot of pork or pork products used for pork-filled pasta products for export to the United States. Each record must include the following: 


(i) The date that the cooked or dry-cured pork product was received in the processing facility; 


(ii) The number of packages, the number of hams or cooked pork products per package, and the weight of each package; 


(iii) A lot number or other identification marks; 


(iv) The health certificate that accompanied the cooked or dry-cured pork product from the slaughter/processing facility to the meat-filled pasta product processing facility; and 


(v) The date that the pork or pork product used in the pasta started dry curing (if the product used is a dry-cured ham) or the date that the product was cooked (if the product used is a cooked pork product). 


(10) The pork-filled pasta must be accompanied by a certificate issued by an official of the National Government of the region in which the pasta product is processed who is authorized to issue the foreign meat inspection certificate required under § 327.4 of this title, stating that the pork-filled pasta product has been processed in accordance with the requirements of this section. 


Upon arrival of the pork-filled pasta in the United States, the certificate must be presented to an inspector at the port of arrival.
