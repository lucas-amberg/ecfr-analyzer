(a) The commodities were derived from bovines that have never been fed meat-and-bone meal or greaves derived from ruminants.


(b) The commodities were derived from bovines that passed ante-mortem and post-mortem inspections.


(c) The commodities were derived from bovines that were not subjected to a stunning process, prior to slaughter, with a device injecting compressed air or gas into the cranial cavity, or to a pithing process.


(d) The commodities were produced and handled in a manner that ensured that such commodities do not contain and are not contaminated with any of the following:


(1) SRMs from regions of undetermined risk for BSE; or


(2) Mechanically separated meat from the skull and vertebral column from bovines over 12 months of age.


(e) The commodities are accompanied by an original certificate stating that the exporting region is a region of undetermined risk for BSE and that the conditions of this section have been met. The certificate must be issued and signed by a full-time salaried veterinary officer of the national government of the exporting region, or signed by a person authorized to issue such certificates by the veterinary services of the national government of the exporting region.
