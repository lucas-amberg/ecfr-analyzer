# § 94.6   Carcasses, meat, parts or products of carcasses, and eggs (other than hatching eggs) of poultry, game birds, or other birds; importations from regions where Newcastle disease or highly pathogenic avian influenza is considered to exist.

(a) *Disease status of regions for Newcastle disease and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)*—(1) *Regions in which Newcastle disease is not considered to exist.* (i) A list of free regions is maintained on the APHIS website at *https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-and-animal-product-import-information/animal-health-status-of-regions.* Copies of the list are also available via postal mail upon request to Regionalization Evaluation Services, Strategy and Policy, Veterinary Services, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, 4700 River Road, Unit 38, Riverdale, Maryland 20737; *AskRegionalization@usda.gov.*

(ii) APHIS will remove a region from the list referenced in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section upon determining that Newcastle disease exists there based on reports APHIS receives of outbreaks of the disease in commercial birds or poultry from veterinary officials of the exporting country, from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), or from other sources the Administrator determines to be reliable. APHIS will add a region to this list after it conducts an evaluation of the region and finds that Newcastle disease is not likely to be present in its commercial bird or poultry populations. In the case of a region formerly on this list that is removed due to an outbreak, the region may be returned to the list in accordance with the procedures for reestablishment of a region's disease-free status in § 92.4 of this subchapter.


(2) *Regions in which HPAI is considered to exist.* (i) A list of affected regions is maintained on the APHIS website at *https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-and-animal-product-import-information/animal-health-status-of-regions.* Copies of the list can be obtained via postal mail upon request to Regionalization Evaluation Services, Strategy and Policy, Veterinary Services, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, 4700 River Road, Unit 38, Riverdale, Maryland 20737; *AskRegionalization@usda.gov.*

(ii) APHIS will consider a region to have HPAI and add it to this list referenced in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section upon determining that HPAI exists in commercial birds or poultry in the region based on reports APHIS receives of outbreaks of the disease from veterinary officials of the exporting country, from the OIE, or from other sources the Administrator determines to be reliable. APHIS will remove a region from this list only after it conducts an evaluation of the region and finds that HPAI is not likely to be present in its commercial bird or poultry populations.


(b) *Carcasses, and parts or products of carcasses, including meat, from regions where Newcastle disease or HPAI is considered to exist.* This paragraph applies to carcasses, and parts or products of carcasses, 
4 including meat, of poultry, game birds, or other birds that were raised or slaughtered in any region where Newcastle disease or any subtype of HPAI is considered to exist (*see* paragraph (a) of this section); are imported from any such region; or are moved into or through any such region at any time before importation or during shipment to the United States.


(1) Carcasses of game birds, if eviscerated with heads and feet removed, may be imported from regions where Newcastle disease is considered to exist. Carcasses of game birds may not be imported from regions where any subtype of HPAI is considered to exist. Viscera, heads, and feet removed from game birds in any of these regions are ineligible for entry into the United States.


(2) Carcasses, or parts or products of carcasses, of poultry, game birds, and other birds from regions where Newcastle disease or HPAI are considered to exist may be imported for consignment to any museum, educational institution or other establishment which has provided the Administrator with evidence that it has the equipment, facilities, and capabilities to store, handle, process, or disinfect such articles so as to prevent the introduction or dissemination of Newcastle disease or HPAI into the United States, and which is approved by the Administrator.

(3) Carcasses, or parts or products of carcasses, including meat, of poultry, game birds, or other birds, may be imported if packed in hermetically sealed containers and if cooked by a commercial method after such packing to produce articles that are shelf stable without refrigeration.


(4) Carcasses and parts or products of carcasses, including meat, of poultry, game birds, or other birds, may be imported if they are accompanied by a certificate that is signed by a full-time, salaried veterinarian of the government agency responsible for animal health in the region and that specifies that the articles were cooked throughout to reach a minimum internal temperature of 74 °C (165 °F).


(5) Carcasses, and parts or products of carcasses, including meat, of poultry, game birds, or other birds, that originated in a region considered to be free of Newcastle disease and any subtype of HPAI, and that are processed (cut, packaged, or other processing) in a region where Newcastle disease or HPAI is considered to exist, may be imported under the following conditions:


(i) *Shipment to processing establishments.* All poultry, game bird, or other bird products from such regions shall be shipped from the Newcastle disease and HPAI-free region where they originated to a processing establishment 
6 in the region where Newcastle disease or HPAI is considered to exist in closed containers sealed with serially numbered seals applied by an official of the national government of that region. They must be accompanied by a certificate that is signed by a full-time, salaried veterinarian of the government agency responsible for animal health in the region and that specifies the products' region of origin, the processing establishment to which the carcasses or parts or products are consigned, and the numbers of the seals applied to the shipping containers.


(A) The poultry, game bird, or other bird carcasses or parts or products may be removed from containers at the processing establishment in the region where Newcastle disease or HPAI is considered to exist only after an official of the national government has determined that the seals are intact and free of any evidence of tampering. The official must attest to this fact by signing the certificate accompanying the shipment.


(B) [Reserved]


(ii) *Handling of poultry, game bird, or other bird carcasses or parts or products.* Establishments in regions where Newcastle disease or HPAI is considered to exist that process poultry, game bird, or other bird carcasses or parts or products for export to the United States:


(A) May not receive or handle any live poultry or birds.


(B) Must keep any records required by this section on file at the facility for a period of at least 2 years after export of processed products to the United States, and must make those records available to USDA inspectors during inspections.


(C) May process carcasses or parts or products that originate in any region, provided that:


(*1*) All areas, utensils, and equipment likely to contact the carcasses or parts or products to be processed, including skinning, deboning, cutting, and packing areas, are cleaned and disinfected between processing carcasses or parts or products from regions where Newcastle disease or HPAI is considered to exist and processing those from Newcastle disease and HPAI-free regions.


(*2*) Carcasses or parts or products intended for export to the United States are not handled, cut, or otherwise processed at the same time as any carcasses or parts or products not eligible for export to the United States.


(*3*) Carcasses or parts or products intended for export to the United States are packed in clean new packaging that is clearly distinguishable from that containing any carcasses or parts or products not eligible for export to the United States.


(*4*) Carcasses or parts or products are stored in a manner that ensures that no cross-contamination occurs.


(iii) *Cooperative service agreement.* Operators of processing establishments must enter into a cooperative service agreement with APHIS to pay all expenses incurred by APHIS in inspecting the establishment. APHIS anticipates that such inspections will occur once a year. The cooperative service account must always contain a balance that is at least equal to the cost of one inspection. APHIS will charge the cooperative service account for travel, salary, and subsistence of APHIS employees, as well as administrative overhead and other incidental expenses (including excess baggage charges up to 150 pounds).


(iv) *Shipment to the United States.* Poultry, game bird, or other bird carcasses or parts or products to be imported into the United States must be shipped from the region where they were processed in closed containers sealed with serially numbered seals applied by an official of the national government of that region. The shipments must be accompanied by a certificate signed by an official of the national government of the region where articles were processed that lists the numbers of the seals applied and states that all of the conditions of this section have been met. A copy of this certificate must be kept on file at the processing establishment for at least 2 years.


(6) Poultry, game bird, or other bird carcasses or parts or products that do not otherwise qualify for importation under paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section may be imported only if the importer applies to, and is granted a permit by, the Administrator, authorizing such importation. A permit will be given only when the Administrator determines that such importation will not constitute a risk of introduction or dissemination of Newcastle disease or HPAI into the United States. Application for a permit may be made in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.


(c) *Eggs (other than hatching eggs) from regions where Newcastle disease or HPAI is considered to exist.* Eggs (other than hatching eggs 
7) from poultry, game birds, or other birds may be imported only in accordance with this section if they: Are laid by poultry, game birds, or other birds that are raised in any region where Newcastle disease or HPAI is considered to exist (*see* paragraph (a) of this section); are imported from any region where Newcastle disease or HPAI is considered to exist; or are moved into or through any region where Newcastle disease or HPAI is considered to exist at any time before importation or during shipment to the United States. 


(1) *With a certificate.* The eggs may be imported if they are accompanied by a certificate signed by a salaried veterinary officer of the national government of the region of origin or, if exported from Mexico, accompanied either by such a certificate or by a certificate issued by a veterinarian accredited by the national government of Mexico and endorsed by a full-time salaried veterinary officer of the national government of Mexico, thereby representing that the veterinarian issuing the certificate was authorized to do so, and:


(i) The eggs are imported in cases marked with the identity of the flock of origin and sealed with the seal of the national government of the region of origin. 


(ii) The certificate accompanying the eggs is presented to an authorized inspector when the eggs reach the port of arrival in the United States. 


(iii) The certificate identifies the flock of origin and shows the region of origin, the port of embarkation, the port of arrival, the name and address of the exporter and importer, the total number of eggs, and cases of eggs, shipped with the certificate, and the date the certificate was signed. 


(iv) The certificate states that the eggs qualify for importation in accordance with this section. 


(v) The certificate states that no more than 90 days before the certificate was signed, a salaried veterinary officer of the national government of the region of origin or, if exported from Mexico, by a veterinarian accredited by the national government of Mexico, inspected the flock of origin and found no evidence of communicable diseases of poultry.


(vi) The eggs were washed, to remove foreign material from the surface of the shells, and sanitized on the premises of origin with a hypochlorite solution of from 100 ppm to 200 ppm available chlorine. 


(vii) The eggs were packed on the premises of origin in previously unused cases. 


(viii) Before leaving the premises of origin, the cases in which the eggs were packed were sealed with a seal of the national government of the region of origin by the salaried veterinarian of the national government of the region of origin who signed the certificate or, if exported from Mexico, by the veterinarian accredited by the national government of Mexico who signed the certificate.


(ix) In addition, if the eggs were laid in any region where Newcastle disease or HPAI is considered to exist (see paragraph (a) of this section), the certificate must also state:


(A) No Newcastle disease or HPAI occurred on the premises of origin or on adjoining premises during the 90 days before the certificate was signed. 


(B) There is no evidence that the flock of origin was exposed to Newcastle disease or HPAI during the 90 days before the certificate was signed. 


(C) The eggs are from a region free of HPAI, or from a flock of origin found free of Newcastle disease as follows: On the seventh and fourteenth days of the 21-day period before the certificate is signed, at least 1 cull bird (a sick or dead bird, not a healthy bird that was killed) for each 10,000 live birds occupying each poultry house certified for exporting table eggs was tested for Newcastle disease virus using embryonated egg inoculation technique. The weekly cull rate of birds of every exporting poultry house within the exporting farm does not exceed 0.1 percent. The tests present no clinical or immunological evidence of Newcastle disease by embryonated egg inoculation technique from tissues of birds that were culled and have been collected by a salaried veterinary officer of the national government of the region of origin or by a veterinarian accredited by the national government of Mexico. All examinations and embryonated egg inoculation tests were conducted in a laboratory located in the region of origin, and the laboratory was approved to conduct the examinations and tests by the veterinary services organization of the national government of that region. All results were negative for Newcastle disease.


(D) Egg drop syndrome is notifiable in the region of origin and there have been no reports of egg drop syndrome in the flocks of origin of the eggs, or within a 50 kilometer radius of the flock of origin, for the 90 days prior to the issuance of the certificate.


(2) *To an approved establishment for breaking and pasteurization.* The eggs may be imported if they are moved from the port of arrival in the United States, under seal of the United States Department of Agriculture, to an approved establishment for breaking and pasteurization. Establishments will be approved when the Administrator determines that pasteurization and sanitation procedures for handling the eggs, and for disposing of egg shells, cases, and packing materials, are adequate to prevent the introduction of Newcastle disease and HPAI into the United States. 


(3) *For scientific, educational, or research purposes.* The eggs may be imported if they are imported for scientific, educational, or research purposes and the Administrator has determined that the importation can be made under conditions that will prevent the introduction of Newcastle disease and HPAI into the United States. The eggs must be accompanied by a permit obtained from APHIS prior to the importation in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, and they must be moved and handled as specified on the permit to prevent the introduction of Newcastle disease and HPAI into the United States.


(4) *Other.* The eggs may be imported when the Administrator determines that the eggs have been cooked or processed or will be handled in a manner that will prevent the introduction of Newcastle disease and HPAI into the United States. The eggs must be accompanied by a permit obtained from APHIS prior to the importation in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, and they must be moved and handled as specified on the permit to prevent the introduction of Newcastle disease and HPAI into the United States.
