# § 112.2   Final container label, carton label, and enclosure.

(a) Unless otherwise provided, final container labels, carton labels, and enclosures (inserts, circulars, or leaflets) shall include the information specified in this section. 




(1) The complete true name of the biological product which name shall be identical with that shown in the product license under which such product is prepared or the permit under which it is imported, shall be prominently lettered and placed giving equal emphasis to each word composing it. Descriptive terms used in the true name on the product license or permit shall also appear. Abbreviations of the descriptive terms may be used on the final container label if complete descriptive terms appear on the carton label and enclosure. The following exceptions are applicable to small final containers, and containers of interchangeable reagents included in diagnostic test kits:


(i) For small final containers, an abbreviated true name of the biological product, which shall be identical with that shown in the product license under which the product is prepared or the permit under which it is imported, may be used: *Provided,* That the complete true name of the product must appear on the carton label and enclosures;


(ii) In addition to the true name of the kit, the functional and/or chemical name of the reagent must appear on labeling for small final containers of reagents included in diagnostic kits: *Provided,* That the true name is not required on labeling for small final containers of interchangeable (non-critical) components of diagnostic kits.




(2) For biological product prepared in the United States or in a foreign country, the name and address of the producer (licensee, or subsidiary) or permittee and of the foreign producer, and an appropriate consumer contact telephone number: *Provided,* That in the case of a biological product exported from the United States in labeled final containers, a consumer contact telephone number is not required; however, small single dose containers marketed in the United States must include contact telephone information on carton and enclosures.




(3) The United States Veterinary Biologics Establishment License Number (VLN) or the United States Veterinary Biological Product Permit Number (VPN), and the Product Code Number (PCN) assigned by the Department, which shall be shown only as “VLN/PCN” and “VPN/PCN,” respectively, except that:


(i) Only the VLN or VPN is required on container labels of interchangeable (non-critical) components of diagnostic kits and container labels for individual products packaged together for co-administration.


(ii) The PCN may be used in lieu of the true name of the kit on small container labels for critical components of diagnostic kits.


(iii) Container labels for individually licensed biological products, when marketed as components of combination packages, must include a statement referring the consumer to the carton or enclosure for the PCN of the combination package.




(4) Storage temperature recommendation for the biological product stated as 2 to 8 °C or 35 to 46 °F, or both.


(5) Full instructions for the proper use of the product, including indications for use, target species, minimum age of administration, route of administration, vaccination schedule, product license restriction(s) that bear on product use, warnings, cautions, and any other vital information for the product's use; except that in the case of limited space on final container labels, a statement as to where such information is to be found, such as “See enclosure for complete directions,” “Full directions on carton,” or comparable statement.


(6) In the case of a multiple-dose final container, a warning to use entire contents when first opened: *Provided,* That a diagnostic or a desensitizing antigen packaged in a multiple-dose final container is exempt.


(7) The following warning statements, or equivalent statements, shall appear on the labeling as applicable:


(i) Products other than diagnostic kits: “Do not mix with other products, except as specified on this label.”


(ii) Injectable products and other products containing hazardous components: “In case of human exposure, contact a physician.”


(iii) Products containing viable organisms: “Inactivate unused contents before disposal.”


(8) In the case of a biological product recommended for use in domestic animals, the edible portion of which may be used for food purposes, a withholding statement of not less than 21 days to read: “Do not vaccinate within (insert number) days before slaughter” or “Do not vaccinate food-producing animals within (insert number) days before slaughter”: *Provided,* That longer periods shall be stated when deemed necessary by the Administrator. Very small final container labels are exempted from this requirement. 


(9) The following information shall appear on the final container label and carton label, if any, but need not appear on the enclosure: 


(i) A permitted expiration date; 


(ii) The number of doses where applicable; 


(iii) The recoverable quantity of the content of each final container stated in cubic centimeters (cc.) or milliliters (ml.) or units. 


(iv) A serial number by which the product can be identified with the manufacturer's records of preparation: *Provided,* That when a liquid antigenic fraction is to be used instead of a water diluent for one or more desiccated antigenic fractions in a combination package, a hyphenated serial number composed of a serial number for the desiccated fraction and the serial number for the liquid fraction shall be used on the carton. 


(v) A statement similar to “For more information regarding efficacy and safety data, go to *productdata.aphis.usda.gov.*

(10) In the case of a product that contains a preservative that is added during the production process and is not reduced to undetectable levels in the completed product through the production process, the statement “Contains [name of preservative] as a preservative” or an equivalent statement must appear on cartons and enclosures, if used. If cartons are not used, such information must appear on the final container label.


(11) The number of final containers of biological product and the number of doses in each final container shall be stated on each carton label for all cartons containing more than one final container of biological product. The number of final containers of diluent, if any, and the quantity in each shall also be stated on each carton label. 


(12) An indications statement to read, “This product has been shown to be effective for the vaccination of healthy (insert name of species) ____ weeks of age or older against ____.” *Provided,* That in the case of very small final container labels or carton, a statement as to where such information is to be found, such as “See enclosure for complete directions,” “Full directions on carton,” or comparable statement.


(b) Labels may also include any other statement which is not false or misleading and may include factual statements regarding variable response of different animals when vaccinated as directed but may not include disclaimers of merchantability, fitness for the purpose offered, or responsibility for the product. 


(c) Labels of biological products prepared at licensed establishments or imported shall not include any statement, design, or device, which overshadows the true name of the product as licensed or which is false or misleading in any particular or which may otherwise deceive the purchaser. 


(d) Carton labels and enclosures shall be subject to paragraph (d)(1), (d)(2), and (d)(3) of this section. 


(1) The statement, “Restricted to use by or under the direction of a veterinarian” or “Restricted to use by a veterinarian,” shall be used on all carton labels and enclosures when such restriction is prescribed on the product license. 


(2) If the licensee states on the carton labels and enclosures of a product that its sales are restricted to veterinarians, then the entire production of that particular product in the licensed establishment shall be so restricted by the licensee. 


(3) The statement “For use in animals only” may appear on the labeling as appropriate for a product to indicate that the product is recommended specifically for animals and not for humans.


(e) When label requirements of a foreign country differ from the requirements as prescribed in this part, special labels may be approved by APHIS for use on biological products to be exported to such country upon receipt of written authorization, acceptable to APHIS, from regulatory officials of the importing country, provided that:


(1) If the labeling contains claims or indications for use not supported by data on file with APHIS, the special labels for export shall not bear the VLN.


(2) All other labels for export shall bear the VLN unless the importing country provides documentation that the VLN is specifically prohibited. When laws, regulations, or other requirements of foreign countries require exporters of biological products prepared in a licensed establishment to furnish official certification that such products have been prepared in accordance with the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act and regulations issued pursuant to the Act, such certification may be made by APHIS.


(f) Multiple-dose final containers of liquid biological product and carton tray covers showing required labeling information are subject to the requirements in this paragraphs.
