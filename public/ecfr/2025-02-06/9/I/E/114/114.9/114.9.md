The name of the licensee (or foreign manufacturer) shall appear on the front cover page. 


(3) The pages shall be numbered in the upper center. At least 1
1/2 inch margin shall be left at the top of the first page and a 2 inch margin at the bottom of each page for the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service stamp. 


(4) Amended pages shall be numbered the same as those being superseded. They shall bear the date prepared and refer to the date on the pages being superseded.
