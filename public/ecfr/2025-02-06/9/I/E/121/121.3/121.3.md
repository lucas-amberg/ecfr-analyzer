# ยง 121.3   VS select agents and toxins.

(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, the Administrator has determined that the biological agents and toxins listed in this section have the potential to pose a severe threat to animal health or to animal products. The select agents and toxins marked with an asterisk (*) are designated as Tier 1 select agents and toxins and are subject to additional requirements as listed in this part.


(b) VS select agents and toxins are:


(1) African swine fever virus;


(2) Avian influenza virus;


(3) Classical swine fever virus;


(4) * Foot-and-mouth disease virus;


(5) Goat pox virus;


(6) Lumpy skin disease virus;


(7) *Mycoplasma capricolum;*

(8) *Mycoplasma mycoides;*

(9) Newcastle disease virus; 
1

(10) Peste des petits ruminants virus;


(11) * Rinderpest virus;


(12) Sheep pox virus; and


(13) Swine vesicular disease virus.


(c) Genetic elements, recombinant and/or synthetic nucleic acids, and recombinant and/or synthetic organisms:


(1) Nucleic acids that can produce infectious forms of any of the select agent viruses listed in paragraph (b) of this section. 
2

(2) Recombinant and/or synthetic nucleic acids that encode for the functional forms of any toxin listed in paragraph (b) of this section if the nucleic acids:


(i) Can be expressed *in vivo* or *in vitro;* or


(ii) Are in a vector or recombinant host genome and can be expressed *in vivo* or *in vitro.*

(3) VS select agents and toxins listed in paragraph (b) of this section that have been genetically modified.


(d) VS select agents or toxins that meet any of the following criteria are excluded from the requirements of this part:


(1) Any VS select agent or toxin that is in its naturally occurring environment, provided that the agent or toxin has not been intentionally introduced, cultivated, collected, or otherwise extracted from its natural source.


(2) Nonviable VS select agents or nontoxic VS toxins.
3

(3) A select agent or toxin that has been subjected to decontamination or a destruction procedure when intended for waste disposal.


(4) A select agent or regulated nucleic acids that can produce infectious forms of any select agent virus that has been subjected to a validated inactivation procedure that is confirmed through a viability testing protocol. Surrogate strains that are known to possess equivalent properties with respect to inactivation can be used to validate an inactivation procedure; however, if there are known strain-to-strain variations in the resistance of a select agent to an inactivation procedure, then an inactivation procedure validated on a lesser resistant strain must also be validated on the more resistant strains.


(5) Material containing a select agent that is subjected to a procedure that removes all viable select agent cells, spores, or virus particles if the material is subjected to a viability testing protocol to ensure that the removal method has rendered the material free of all viable select agent.


(6) A select agent or regulated nucleic acids that can produce infectious forms of any select agent virus not subjected to a validated inactivation procedure or material containing a select agent not subjected to a procedure that removes all viable select agent cells, spores, or virus particles if the material is determined by the Administrator to be effectively inactivated or effectively removed. To apply for a determination an individual or entity must submit a written request and supporting scientific information to APHIS. A written decision granting or denying the request will be issued.


(7) A VS select toxin identified in an original food sample or clinical sample.


(8) Waste generated during the delivery of patient care by health care professionals from a patient diagnosed with an illness or condition associated with a select agent, where that waste is decontaminated or transferred for destruction by complying with State and Federal regulations within 7 calendar days of the conclusion of patient care.


(9) Any low pathogenic strains of avian influenza virus, avian paramyxovirus serotype-1 (APMV-1) viruses which do not meet the criteria for Newcastle disease virus,
4 including those identified as pigeon paramyxovirus-1 
5 isolated from a non-poultry species, all subspecies *Mycoplasma capricolum* except subspecies *capripneumoniae* (contagious caprine pleuropneumonia), and all subspecies *Mycoplasma mycoides* except subspecies *mycoides* small colony (*Mmm* SC) (contagious bovine pleuropneumonia), provided that the individual or entity can identify that the agent is within the exclusion category.


(e) An attenuated strain of a select agent or a select toxin modified to be less potent or toxic may be excluded from the requirements of this part based upon a determination by the Administrator that the attenuated strain or modified toxin does not pose a severe threat to animal health or animal products.


(1) To apply for exclusion, an individual or entity must submit a written request and supporting scientific information. A written decision granting or denying the request will be issued. An exclusion will be effective upon notification to the applicant. Exclusions will be listed on the National Select Agent Registry Web site at *http://www.selectagents.gov/.*

(2) If an excluded attenuated strain or modified toxin is subjected to any manipulation that restores or enhances its virulence or toxic activity, the resulting select agent or toxin will be subject to the requirements of this part.


(3) An individual or entity may make a written request to the Administrator for reconsideration of a decision denying an application for the exclusion of an attenuated strain of a select agent or a select toxin modified to be less potent or toxic. The written request for reconsideration must state the facts and reasoning upon which the individual or entity relies to show the decision was incorrect. The Administrator will grant or deny the request for reconsideration as promptly as circumstances allow and will state, in writing, the reasons for the decision.


(f) Any VS select agent or toxin seized by a Federal law enforcement agency will be excluded from the requirements of this part during the period between seizure of the agent or toxin and the transfer or destruction of such agent or toxin provided that:


(1) As soon as practicable, the Federal law enforcement agency transfers the seized agent or toxin to an entity eligible to receive such agent or toxin or destroys the agent or toxin by a recognized sterilization or inactivation process.


(2) The Federal law enforcement agency safeguards and secures the seized agent or toxin against theft, loss, or release, and reports any theft, loss, or release of such agent or toxin.


(3) The Federal law enforcement agency reports the seizure of the select agent or toxin to APHIS or CDC.


(i) The seizure of any of the following VS select agents and toxins must be reported within 24 hours by telephone, facsimile, or e-mail: African horse sickness virus, African swine fever virus, avian influenza virus (highly pathogenic), classical swine fever virus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, virulent Newcastle disease virus, rinderpest virus, and swine vesicular disease virus. This report must be followed by submission of APHIS/CDC Form 4 within 7 calendar days after seizure of the select agent or toxin.


(ii) For all other VS select agents or toxins, APHIS/CDC Form 4 must be submitted within 7 calendar days after seizure of the agent or toxin.


(iii) A copy of APHIS/CDC Form 4 must be maintained for 3 years.


(4) The Federal law enforcement agency reports the final disposition of the select agent or toxin by submission of APHIS/CDC Form 4. A copy of the completed form must be maintained for 3 years.
