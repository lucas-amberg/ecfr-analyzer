# § 145.102   Participation.

Participating flocks of egg/meat-type game birds, raised-for-release game birds, and the products produced from them shall comply with the applicable general provisions of subpart A of this part and the special provisions of this subpart. Participation is broken into the following categories of operation and products:


(a) The categories for operation are:


(1) *Breeder.* An individual or business that maintains a breeding flock for the purpose of producing eggs, chicks, started, or mature birds. A breeder that is also a hatchery and/or grower shall be categorized as a breeder.


(2) *Hatchery.* A category of operations in which an individual or business does not have a breeding flock, but hatches eggs for the purpose of producing chicks, started, or mature birds. A hatchery that is also a grower shall be categorized as a hatchery.


(3) *Grower.* A category of operations in which an individual or business does not have a breeding flock or hatchery, but raises birds for the purpose of selling started or mature birds.


(4) *Dealer.* An individual or business that resells eggs, chicks, started, or mature birds. Products a dealer handles are typically resold within 30 days or less.


(b) The categories for products are:


(1) *Egg.* An egg laid by a female bird for the purpose of hatching a chick.


(2) *Chick.* A bird that is newly hatched from an egg.


(3) *Started bird.* A bird that is between the age of a newly hatched chick and a mature bird.


(4) *Mature bird.* A bird that is fully colored and has reached the average maximum size specific to each species.


(c) Products shall lose their identity under Plan terminology when not maintained by Plan participants under the conditions prescribed in § 145.5(a).


(d) Hatching eggs produced by breeding flocks shall be nest clean, fumigated, or otherwise sanitized in accordance with part 147 of this subchapter.


(e) It is recommended that gallinaceous flocks and waterfowl flocks be kept separate.


(f) Any nutritive material provided to baby poultry must be free of the avian pathogens that are officially represented in the Plan disease classifications listed in § 145.10.


(g) A flock of game birds that are not breeders, but are located on the same premise as game bird breeders, shall be covered under the same NPIP hatchery approval number as long as the appropriate testing requirements have been met.


(h) All participating raised-for-release game bird flocks, regardless of whether they are breeders or non-breeders, shall be enrolled under this subpart.


(i) A breeder, hatchery, or grower may also be a dealer without being categorized as a dealer. To resell products under the assigned NPIP number and avoid losing NPIP flock classifications, products must be purchased from an NPIP participant with equal or greater classifications or from a flock with equivalent or greater testing requirements under official supervision.


(j) Subject to the approval of the Service and the Official State Agencies in the importing and exporting States, participating flocks may report poultry sales to importing States by using either VS Form 9-3, “Report of Sales of Hatching Eggs, Chicks, and Poults,” or by using an invoice form (9-3I) approved by the Official State Agency and the Service to identify poultry sales to clients. If the 9-3I form is used, the following information must be included on the form:


(1) The form number “9-3I”, printed or stamped on the invoice;


(2) The seller name and address;


(3) The date of shipment;


(4) The invoice number;


(5) The purchaser name and address;


(6) The quantity of products sold;


(7) Identification of the products by bird variety or by NPIP stock code as listed in the NPIP APHIS 91-55-078 appendix; and


(8) The appropriate NPIP illustrative design in § 145.10. One of the designs in § 145.10(b) or (g) must be used. The following information must be provided in or near the NPIP design:


(i) The NPIP State number and NPIP approval number; and


(ii) The NPIP classification for which product is qualified (*e.g.,* U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean).
