# ยง 151.11   Form of books of record.

(a) If a registry association has not published its book of record in printed form, a record in approved microfilm form which the Administrator finds provides a system for determining the recorded ancestry of the animals identified therein will be acceptable. When a registry association which has published its book of record in printed form ceases such publication and in lieu thereof publishes a microfilm record, the microfilm record shall commence with the first pedigree recorded by the association which is not in the printed volumes and shall otherwise be in approved form. 


(b) A microfilm record will be approved under this part only if it is 16 mm. non-perforated safety film exposed at a reduction ratio not to exceed 24 diameters. All information on the original document shall be reproduced onto the microfilm so that it is clearly readable. The microfilm carton shall be indexed to state the numbers of the pedigree certificates on the roll of film it contains.
