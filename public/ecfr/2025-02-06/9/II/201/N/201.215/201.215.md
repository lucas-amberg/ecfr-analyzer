# ยง 201.215   Suspension of delivery of birds.

The Secretary may consider various criteria when determining whether or not reasonable notice has been given by a live poultry dealer to a poultry grower for suspension of delivery of birds. These criteria include, but are not limited to:


(a) Whether the written notice adequately states the reason for the suspension of delivery, the length of the suspension of delivery, and the anticipated date the delivery of birds will resume; and


(b) Whether a catastrophic or natural disaster, or other emergency, such as an unforeseen bankruptcy, has occurred that has prevented a live poultry dealer from providing reasonable notice.
