The written notice should provide:


(1) Notification to preserve trust benefits;


(2) Identification of packer, live poultry dealer, or livestock dealer;


(3) Identification of seller or poultry grower;


(4) Date of the transaction;


(5) Date of seller's or poultry grower's receipt of notice that payment instrument has been dishonored (if applicable); and

(c) For purposes of administering statutory trusts under the Act, a *cash sale* means a sale in which the seller does not expressly extend credit to the buyer.
