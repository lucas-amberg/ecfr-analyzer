# ยง 203.17   Statement of general policy with respect to rates and charges at posted stockyards.

(a) Requests have been received from stockyard operators, market agencies, and livestock producers urging a reduction of rate regulation at posted stockyards. Their requests are based on the belief that competition among markets will set a level of rates and charges fair to both the market operator and to the livestock producer. PSD will accept for filing tariffs containing any level of charges after 10 days' notice to the public and to the Secretary as required by the Act.


(b) PSD will not investigate the level of rates and charges established by stockyard owners and market agencies for reasonableness except upon receipt of a valid complaint or under compelling circumstances warranting such an investigation. Stockyard owners and market agencies will have substantial flexibility in setting their own rates and charges.


(c) Complaints filed about the reasonableness of rates and charges will be investigated to determine the validity of such complaints and appropriate action taken if warranted.


(d) PSD will continue to insure that the schedules of rates and charges filed with the Department are applied uniformly and in a nondiscriminatory manner.
