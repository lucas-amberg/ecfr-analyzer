# § 205.212   “Buyer in ordinary course of business” and “security interest.”

The terms “buyer in ordinary course of business” and “security interest” are defined in subsections (c) (1) and (7). There are differences between those definitions and the UCC definitions of the same terms. In interpreting those differences, the following would be pertinent: 


(a) The legislative intent discussed above in § 205.211, to pre-empt State laws reflecting the “farm products” exception; and 


(b) The legislative intent shown in subsections (a) and (b) that certain persons take free and clear of certain interests of a “secured lender” “when the seller fails to repay the lender,” unless such persons have information about such interests made available to them as provided in the Section.
