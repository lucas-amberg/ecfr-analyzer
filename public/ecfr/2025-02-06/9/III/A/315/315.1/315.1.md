# § 315.1   Carcasses and parts passed for cooking; rendering into lard or tallow.

Carcasses and parts passed for cooking may be rendered into lard in accordance with § 319.702 of this subchapter or rendered into tallow, provided such rendering is done in the following manner: 


(a) When closed rendering equipment is used, the lower opening, except when permanently connected with a blowline, shall first be sealed securely by a Program employee; then the carcasses or parts shall be placed in such equipment in his presence, after which the upper opening shall be securely sealed by such employee. When the product passed for cooking in the tank does not consist of a carcass or whole primal part, the requirements for sealing shall be at the discretion of the circuit supervisor. Such carcasses and parts shall be cooked for a time sufficient to render them effectually into lard or tallow, provided all parts of the products are heated to a temperature not lower than 170 °F. for a period of not less than 30 minutes. 


(b) At establishments not equipped with closed rendering equipment for rendering carcasses and parts passed for cooking into lard and tallow, such carcasses or parts may be rendered in open kettles under the direct supervision of a Program employee. Such rendering shall be done during regular hours of work and in compliance with the requirements as to temperature and time specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
