# § 316.11   Special markings for certain meat food products.

(a) Meat food products prepared in casing or link form (whether or not thereafter subdivided), other than sausage, which possess the characteristics of or resemble sausage, shall bear on each link or piece the word “imitation” prominently displayed: *Provided,* That the following need not be so marked if they bear on each link or piece the name of the product in accordance with § 317.2 of this subchapter: Such products as coppa, capocollo, lachschinken, bacon, pork loins, pork shoulder butts, and similar cuts of meat which are prepared without added substance other than curing materials or condiments; meat rolls, bockwurst, and similar products which do not contain cereal or vegetables; headcheese, souse, sulze, scrapple, blood pudding, and liver pudding; and other products such as loaves, chili con carne, and meat and cheese products when prepared with sufficient cheese to give definite characteristics to the finished products: *And provided further,* That imitation sausage packed in properly labeled containers having a capacity of 3 pounds or less and of a kind usually sold at retail intact, need not bear the word “imitation” on each link or piece if no other marking or labeling is applied directly to the product. 


(b) When cereal, vegetable starch, starchy vegetable flour, soy flour, soy protein concentrate, isolated soy protein, dried milk, nonfat dry milk, or calcium reduced dried skim milk is added to sausage in casing or in link form within the limits prescribed in part 319 of this subchapter, the products shall be marked with the name of each added ingredient, as for example “cereal added,” “potato flour added,” “cereal and potato flour added,” “soy flour added,” “isolated soy protein added,” “nonfat dry milk added,” “calcium reduced dried skim milk added,” or “cereal and nonfat dry milk added,” as the case may be. 


(c)(1) When product is placed in a casing to which artificial coloring is thereafter applied, as permitted in part 318 of this subchapter, the product shall be legibly and conspicuously marked by stamping or printing on the casing the words “artificially colored.” 


(2) If a casing is removed from product at an official establishment and there is evidence of artificial coloring on the surface of the product, the product from which the casing has been removed shall be marked by stamping directly thereon the words “artificially colored.” 


(3) The casing containing product need not be marked to show that it is colored if it is colored prior to its use as a covering for the product, and the coloring is of a kind and so applied as not to be transferable to the product and not to be misleading or deceptive in any respect. 


(d) When an approved artificial smoke flavoring or an approved smoke flavoring is added to the formula of any meat food product as permitted in part 318 of this subchapter, the product shall be legibly and conspicuously marked with the words “Artificial Smoke Flavoring Added” or “Smoke Flavoring Added,” whichever may be applicable. 


(e) Subject to the provisions in paragraph (a) of this section, in the case of sausage of the smaller varieties, the markings prescribed in this section may be limited to links bearing the official inspection legend, and such markings shall not be required if the sausages are packed in properly labeled containers having a capacity of 3 pounds or less and of a kind usually sold at retail intact. Further, all markings otherwise required by this section (except those required by paragraph (a) of this section) may be omitted from the casings of sausage and other meat food products when these products are to be processed in sealed metal containers properly labeled in accordance with the requirements in part 317 of this subchapter. 


(f) When an approved antioxidant is added to any meat food product as permitted in parts 318 and 319 of this subchapter, the products shall be legibly and conspicuously marked in an approved manner identifying the specific antioxidant used by its common name or approved abbreviation and the purpose for which it is added, such as, “BHA, BHT, and Propylgallate added to help protect flavor.” 


(g) Sausage of the dry varieties treated with potassium sorbate or propylparaben (propyl p-hydroxybenzoate) as permitted by part 318 of this subchapter shall be marked as prescribed in § 317.8(b)(28) of this subchapter).
