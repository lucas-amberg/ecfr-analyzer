# § 317.302   Location of nutrition information.

(a) Nutrition information on a label of a packaged meat or meat food product shall appear on the label's principal display panel or on the information panel, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.


(b) Nutrition information for gift packs may be shown at a location other than on the product label, provided that the labels for these products bear no nutrition claim. In lieu of on the product label, nutrition information may be provided by alternate means such as product label inserts. 


(c) Meat or meat food products in packages that have a total surface area available to bear labeling greater than 40 square inches but whose principal display panel and information panel do not provide sufficient space to accommodate all required information may use any alternate panel that can be readily seen by consumers for the nutrition information. In determining the sufficiency of available space for the nutrition information, the space needed for vignettes, designs, and other nonmandatory label information on the principal display panel may be considered.
