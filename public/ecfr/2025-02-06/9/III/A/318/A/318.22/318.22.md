# § 318.22   Determination of added water in cooked sausages.

(a) For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply. 


(1) *Cooked sausage.* Cooked sausage is any product described in § 319.140 and §§ 319.180-319.182 of this chapter. 


(2) *Group 1 Protein-Contributing Ingredients.* Ingredients of livestock or poultry origin from muscle tissue which is skeletal or which is found in the edible organs, with or without the accompanying and overlying fat, and the portions of bone, skin, sinew, nerve, and blood vessels which normally accompany the muscle tissue and which are not separated from it in the process of dressing; meat byproducts; mechanically separated (species); and poultry products; except those ingredients processed by hydrolysis, extraction, concentrating or drying.


(3) *Group 2 Protein-Contributing Ingredients.* Ingredients from Gorup 1 protein-contributing ingredients processed by hydrolysis, extraction, concentrating, or drying, or any other ingredient which contributes protein. 


(b) The amount of added water in cooked sausage is calculated by:


(1) Determining by laboratory analysis the total percentage of water contained in the cooked sausage; and 


(2) Determining by laboratory analysis the total percentage of protein contained in the cooked sausage; and 


(3) Calculating the percentage of protein in the cooked sausage contributed by the Group 2 protein-contributing ingredients; and 


(4) Subtracting one pecent from the total percentage of protein calculated in (b)(3)); and


(5) Subtracting the remaining percentage of protein calculated in (b)(3) from the total protein content determined in (b)(2); and


(6) Calculating the percentage of indigenous water in the cooked sausage by multiplying the percentage of protein determined in (b)(5) by 4, (This amount is the percentage of water attributable to Group 1 protein-contributing ingredients and one percent of Group 2 protein-contributing ingredients in a cooked sausage.); and 


(7) Subtracting the percentage of water calculated in (b)(6) from the total percentage of water determined in (b)(1). (This amount is the percentage of added water in a cooked sausage.)
