# ยง 352.7   Marking and labeling of inspected products.

Wording and form of inspection mark. This wording shall be contained within a triangle in the form and arrangement shown in this section. The establishment number of the official establishment shall be included in the triangle unless it appears elsewhere on the packaging material. Ordering and manufacture of the triangle brand shall be in accordance with the provisions in 9 CFR 317.3(c) of the Federal meat inspection regulations. The Administrator may approve the use of abbreviations of such inspection mark, and such approved abbreviations shall have the same force and effect as the inspection mark. The inspection mark or approved abbreviation shall be applied, under the supervision of the inspector, to the inspected and passed edible product, packaging material, immediate container or shipping container. When the inspection mark or approved abbreviation is used on packaging material, immediate container or shipping container, it shall be printed on such material or container or on a label to be affixed to the packaging material or container. The name and address of the packer or distributor of such product shall be printed on the packaging material or label. The inspection marks may be stenciled on the container, and when the inspection mark is so stenciled, the name and address of the packer or distributor may be applied by the use of a stencil or rubber stamp. The name and address of the packer or distributor, if prominently shown elsewhere on the packaging material or container, may be omitted from insert labels which bear an official identification if the applicable establishment number is shown. All labels intended for use on inspected and passed exotic animal products must be approved in accordance with Part 412 of this chapter.
