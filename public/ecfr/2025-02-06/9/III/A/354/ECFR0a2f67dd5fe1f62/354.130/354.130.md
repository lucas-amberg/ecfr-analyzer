Rabbits from pathological laboratories shall be condemned. 


(b) Any organ or part of a rabbit carcass affected with a tumor shall be condemned and when there is evidence that the general condition of the rabbit has been affected by the size, position, or nature of the tumor, the whole carcass shall be condemned. In cases of malignant neoplasms involving any internal organ to a marked extent, or affecting the muscles, skeleton, or body lymph glands, even primarily, the whole carcass shall be condemned. 


(c) Carcasses of rabbits showing any disease such as generalized melanosis, pseudoleukemia, and the like, which systemically affect the rabbit, shall be condemned. 


(d) Any organ or part of a carcass which is badly bruised or which is affected by an abscess, or a suppurating sore, shall be condemned. Parts or carcasses which are contaminated by pus shall be condemned. 


(e) Carcasses of rabbits contaminated by volatile oils, paints, poisons, gases, or other substances which affect the wholesomeness of the carcass shall be condemned. 


(f) All carcasses of rabbits so infected that consumption of the meat or meat food products thereof may give rise to meat poisoning shall be condemned. This includes all carcasses showing signs of any of the following diseases: Acute inflammation of the lungs, pleura, pericardium, peritoneum or meninges; septicemia or pyemia, whether traumatic, or without evident cause; gangrenous or severe hemorrhagic enteritis or gastritis; polyarthritis and acute nephritis. Immediately after the slaughter of any rabbit so infected, the infected premises and implements used shall be thoroughly sanitized. The part or parts of any carcass coming into contact with the carcass or any part of the carcass of any rabbit covered by this section other than those affected with acute inflammation of the lungs, pleura, pericardium, peritoneum or meninges, shall be condemned. 


(g) Carcasses showing any degree of icterus with a parenchymatous degeneration of organs, the result of infection or intoxication, and those which, as a result of a pathological condition, show an intense yellow or greenish-yellow discoloration without evidence of infection or intoxication shall be condemned. 


(h) Carcasses of rabbits affected with mange or scab in advanced stages, or showing emaciation or extension of the inflammation to the flesh, shall be condemned. When the diseased condition is slight, the carcass may be passed for food after removal and condemnation of the affected parts. 


(i) In the disposal of carcasses and parts of carcasses showing evidence of infestation with parasites not transmissible to man, the following general rules shall govern: If the lesions are localized in such manner and are of such character that the parasites and the lesions caused by them may be radically removed, the non-affected portion of the carcass, or part of the carcass, may be certified for food after the removal and condemnation of the affected portions. Where a part of a carcass shows numerous lesions caused by parasites, or the character of the infestation is such that complete extirpation of the parasites and lesions is difficult and uncertainly accomplished, or if the parasitic infestation or invasion renders the organ or part in any way unfit for food, the affected organ or part shall be condemned. Where parasites are found to be distributed in a carcass in such a manner or to be of such a character that their removal and the removal of the lesions caused by them are impracticable, no part of the carcass shall be certified for food and the entire carcass shall be condemned. Carcasses infested with a hydatid cyst or cysts (Echinococcus granulosis), transmissible to dogs and from dogs to man, shall in all cases be condemned regardless of the degree of infestation. 


(j) Carcasses of rabbits showing such degree of emaciation or anemic condition as would render the meat unwholesome, and carcasses which show a slimy degeneration of the fat or a serious infiltration of the muscles shall be condemned.
