# § 381.128   Labels in foreign languages.

Any label to be affixed to a container of any dressed poultry or other poultry product for foreign commerce may be printed in a foreign language. However, the official inspection legend and establishment number shall appear on the label in English, but in addition, may be literally translated into such foreign language. Each such label shall be subject to the applicable provisions of §§ 381.115 to 381.141, inclusive. Deviations from the form of labeling required under the regulations may be approved by the Administrator in specific cases and such modified labeling may be used for poultry products to be exported: *Provided,* (a) That the proposed labeling accords to the specifications of the foreign purchaser, (b) that it is not in conflict with the Act or the laws of the country to which it is intended for export, and (c) that the outside of the shipping container is labeled to show that it is intended for export; but if such product is sold or offered for sale in domestic commerce, all the requirements of the regulations shall apply.
