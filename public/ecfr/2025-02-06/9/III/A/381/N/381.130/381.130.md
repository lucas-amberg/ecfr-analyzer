# ยง 381.130   False or misleading labeling or containers; orders to withhold from use.

If the Administrator has reason to believe that any marking or other labeling or the size or form of any container in use or proposed for use with respect to any article subject to the Act is false or misleading in any particular, he may direct that the use of the article be withheld unless it is modified in such manner as the Administrator may prescribe so that it will not be false or misleading. If the person using or proposing to use the labeling or container does not accept the determination of the Administrator, he may request a hearing, but the use of the labeling or container shall, if the Administrator so directs, be withheld pending hearing and final determination by the Secretary in accordance with applicable rules of practice. Any such determination with respect to the matter by the Secretary shall be conclusive unless, within 30 days after the receipt of notice of such final determination, the person adversely affected thereby appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Circuit in which he has his principal place of business, or to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The provisions of section 204 of the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921, as amended, shall be applicable to appeals taken under this section.
