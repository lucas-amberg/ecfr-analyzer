(a) Binders or extenders may be added in accordance with a regulation in this subchapter, in 9 CFR Chapter III, Subchapter E, or in 21 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter A or Subchapter B.

When binding agents are added in excess of 3 percent for cooked rolls and 2 percent for raw rolls, the common name of the agent or the term “Binders Added” shall be included in the name of the product; e.g., “Turkey Roll-Gelatin Added.” 


(b) With respect to heat processed rolls, 2 percent or less liquid based on the weight of the finished product without liquid may remain with or be returned to product labeled as “(Kind) Roll.” 


(c) Heat processed rolls which have more than 2 percent liquid remaining with or returned to the product shall be labeled as “(Kind) Roll with Natural Juices.” If more than 2 percent of any liquid other than natural cookout juices is added, the product must be labeled to indicate that fact; e.g., “Turkey Roll with Broth.” Liquid shall not be returned or added to product within this paragraph graph in excess of the amount normally cooked out during preparation.
