The product name of product fabricated from such pieces of turkey thigh meat equivalent in size to a one-half inch cube or greater shall be further qualified to specify that the product is “Chunked and Formed.” The product name of product fabricated from such pieces of turkey thigh meat smaller than the equivalent of a one-half inch cube shall be further qualified to specify that the product is “Ground and Formed” or “Chopped and Formed” as appropriate. The qualifying statement shall immediately follow and be contiguous to the statement required in paragraph (e) of this section, and shall be not less than one-half the size of the product name but not less than one-eighth inch in height, and shall be in the same style and color and with the same background as the product name.
