# § 381.193   Poultry carcasses, etc., not intended for human food.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, poultry carcasses, and parts and products thereof, that are not intended for use as human food may, after they have been denatured as prescribed in § 381.95, be bought, sold, transported, offered for sale or transportation, or received for transportation, in commerce, or imported, even though they do not comply with all the provisions of the regulations, provided they are marked “Not fit for human food.” These requirements do not apply to parts of poultry carcasses that are naturally inedible by humans, such as entrails.


(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) (2), (3), and (4) of this section, no animal food processed, in whole or in part, from materials derived from the carcasses of poultry in an official establishment or elsewhere, shall be bought, sold, transported, offered for sale or transportation, or received for transportation in commerce, or imported, unless:


(i) It is properly identified as animal food;


(ii) It is not represented as being a human food; and


(iii) It has been denatured as prescribed in § 381.95 so as to be readily distinguishable from an article of human food.


(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an animal food that consists of less than 5 percent of parts or products of the carcasses of poultry and that is not represented by labeling or appearance or otherwise as being a human food or as a product of the poultry industry need not be denatured in accordance with § 381.95.


(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, animal food packed in hermetically sealed, retort processed, conventional retail-size containers, and retail-size packages of semi-moist animal food need not be denatured in accordance with § 381.95 if the name of the article clearly conveys the article's intended use for animal food and appears on the label in a conspicuous manner.


(i) Except as provided in paragraph (ii) of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the name of the article must be stated on the label as “Animal Food,” “Pet Food,” or “(name of species) Food” (e.g., “Dog Food” or “Cat Food”). To be considered conspicuous, the name of the article, wherever it appears on the label, must be stated in letters at least twice as high, wide, and thick as the letters indicating the presence in the article of any ingredients derived from carcasses of poultry.


(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (i) of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the article's name may be stated on the label to show that it is or contains poultry carcass-source material and that the article is for animals; e.g., “Chicken for Pets” or “Turkey Dinner for Cats”: *Provided,* That the entire name of the article is stated, wherever it appears on the label, as an individual, contiguous unit, whether stated on a single line or more than one line, and the letters denoting the article's intended use for animal food are at least as high, wide, and thick as the letters indicating the presence of material derived from any poultry carcass. However, when the label bears on its principal display panel a vignette which pictures, in clearly recognizable form and size, one or more animals of the species for which the article's name indicates the article is intended, the letters used to state the article's intended use shall be at least one-half as high, wide, and thick as the letters used in the article's name or other letters indicating the presence of material derived from any poultry carcass, but shall not be less than 
1/8 inch high. The letters used to state the article's intended use may be separated from the article's name by the vignette.


(iii) Letters used to denote the intended use of the article must contrast as markedly with their background as the letters indicating the presence in the article of poultry carcass-source material contrast with their background.


(4) The requirements of this part do not apply to livestock or poultry feed manufactured from processed poultry byproducts (such as poultry byproduct meal, hydrolyzed poultry feathers, and hydrolyzed poultry byproducts aggregate), or to processed dry animal food.
