# § 439.1   Definitions.

(a) *Accredited Laboratory Program (ALP).* The voluntary Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) program in which non-Federal laboratories are accredited as capable of performing analyses with the level of quality that is necessary to maintain accreditation in the program, on samples of raw or processed meat, poultry, and egg products, and through which a proficiency testing sample program for quality assurance is conducted.


(b) *Food chemistry.* Analysis of raw or processed meat or poultry products for the components moisture, protein, fat, and salt.


(c) *Initial accreditation proficiency testing sample.* A sample provided by the FSIS ALP to a non-Federal laboratory to determine whether the laboratory's analytical capability meets the standards for acceptance into the program. The concentration or presence of the targeted analyte(s) and the composition of the components in the sample is unknown to the laboratory.


(d) *Inter-laboratory accreditation maintenance proficiency testing sample.* A sample provided by the FSIS ALP to an accredited laboratory to assist in determining whether the laboratory is maintaining acceptable analytical performance for a given analyte or component. The concentration or presence of the targeted analyte(s) and the composition of the components in the sample is unknown to the laboratory.


(e) *International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 13528.* ISO 13528:2015(E) Corrected version 2016, “Statistical methods for use in proficiency testing by interlaboratory comparison,” October 15, 2016, or updated versions.


(f) *Probation.* The period commencing with official notification to an accredited laboratory that it no longer satisfies the ALP performance requirements specified in this part and ending with official notification that accreditation is fully restored, is suspended, or is revoked.


(g) *Refusal of accreditation.* An action taken by FSIS when a laboratory that is applying for accreditation is denied the accreditation.


(h) *Responsibly connected.* Any individual, or entity, that is a partner, officer, director, manager, or owner of 10 percent or more of the voting stock of the applicant or recipient of accreditation or an employee in a managerial or executive capacity or any employee who conducts or supervises the analysis of FSIS samples.


(i) *Revocation of accreditation.* An action taken by FSIS against a laboratory thereby removing the laboratory's certification of accreditation and participation in inter-laboratory accreditation maintenance proficiency testing sample events.


(j) *Suspension of accreditation.* An action taken by FSIS against a laboratory thereby temporarily removing the laboratory's certification of accreditation and participation in the inter-laboratory accreditation maintenance proficiency testing sample events. Suspension of accreditation ends when accreditation either is fully restored or is revoked.


(k) *z score.* A statistically derived number representing a laboratory's performance for analyzing quantitative proficiency testing samples. The ALP calculates and interprets *z* scores consistent with the ISO 13528 standard.
