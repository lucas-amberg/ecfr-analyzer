(a) Official plants must test to determine that the production of egg products is in compliance with the Act and the egg products inspection regulations.


(b) To ensure adequate pasteurization:


(1) Pasteurized liquid, frozen, and dried egg products, and heat treated dried egg whites must be sampled and analyzed for the presence of *Salmonella* spp. Such testing by the official plant must be performed in a manner sufficient such that it is possible for the official plant to verify that the system is capable of eliminating *Salmonella* spp. at the time that the annual reassessment occurs, and as regularly as necessary between annual reassessments, to show that the system, when tested, is working.


(2) Samples must be analyzed for the presence of *Salmonella* spp. with such frequency and using such laboratory methods as is sufficient to ensure that product is not adulterated. For each category of product, sampling should be conducted on a rotating basis.


(3) Samples must be drawn from the final packaged form.


(c) Results of all partial and completed analyses performed under paragraph (b) of this section must be provided to inspection program personnel promptly upon receipt by the official plant. Positive test results must be provided to inspection program personnel immediately upon receipt by the official plant.
